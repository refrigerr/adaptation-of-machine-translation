   1059760|00000000||The full list of Margarita Laux-Antille's outstanding mental, spiritual and physical attributes would consume a mountain of parchment. Rita, as her friends called her, once held the position of rector at the Aretuza Academy for Sorceresses on the Isle of Thanedd - the same school attended by her famous ancestor, Ilona Laux-Antille.<br><br>Quite unusually for one of her profession, Margarita showed no interest in politics - it was only care for the good of her school that led her to join the Lodge of Sorceresses.<br><br>Finally, her beauty deserves mention as well. It was said that not even the marble likenesses of goddesses and nymphs chiseled out by the greatest sculptors could rival this sorceress' figure.<br>
   1059773|00000000||Yet with all her astuteness Laux-Antille still could not escape the same fate that so many of her fellows met. She had been arrested some time before our tale begins and was staying in the Oxenfurt prison, awaiting a summary and pre-determined trial.<br>
   1059774|00000000||Only Geralt and Yennefer's daring jailbreak saved Margarita from certain execution.<br>

   1078471|00000000||Villard, you old bastard!<br><br>I ken where you can drub up the coin to pay off your many debts - Velen. Now, blatherheads say those bogs ain't worth a muffled fart from a saggy sow, but don't ye believe them, mate, they dinnae ken shite from sugar! A man can make a killing there - and a dwarf can do twice as good, I'm sure.<br><br>So here's the craik. While crossing Velen a week or so past, I spied a few well-dressed stiffs laying about the forest, travel bags untouched. Refugees, see, fleeing the war - and whoever flies up to them first gets all their worldly belongings. You ken what I'm saying, mate? Grab a chest, head off cross the Pontar posthaste and strip those stiffs of rings, necklaces and everything else afore some nimbler prick does! Oh, but keep a sharp axe round your belt all the while, for Velen's pure heevin with monsters. But hey, it's all in the name of a good cause - filling your pockets!<br><br>Your ever-loving Gruggen<br>
   1078472|00000000||Men are willing to do a great many things for coin - lie, cheat and even loot corpses. Villard and Gruggen were no exceptions in this regard. Like many before them, they died, probably torn to pieces by some necrophage prowling the battlefield. Chalk it up as an occupational hazard, I suppose. Luckily Geralt has good insurance against such hazards - namely the swords he carries on his back.
   1086993|00000000||Geralt never claimed to be an expert in epistolography, but experience had taught him one of its secrets: dead men carry interesting letters. That's why he decided to sit down and study closely a certain corpse-borne missive he happened across during his travels.

   1062219|00000000||Geralt did not meet Anna Strenger, the Bloody Baron's wife, when he visited Crow's Perch. Some time before his arrival this woman had disappeared in unexplained circumstances along with her daughter, Tamara.<br><br>Geralt did, however, receive a detailed description of the missing woman. Anna was a comely forty-something woman with green eyes and hair dark as raven wings which she kept tied in a tight bun behind her head.<br>
   1062220|00000000||Geralt discovered that Anna's marital life had not been working out as well as she might have hoped. She had recently been pregnant, but lost her child for unknown reasons shortly before her disappearance.<br>
   1062221|00000000||When Geralt pushed the baron about the matter, the ugly truth finally came out. Desperate and miserable, Anna had fled, taking Tamara with her, after her drunken husband beat her badly.<br><br>The baron was convinced Anna had miscarried because of his actions, but Geralt was not so certain about this - he couldn't stop thinking about the strange talisman meant to ward off evil power Anna had received from the pellar.<br>
   1062222|00000000||During their heart-to-heart the baron gave Geralt a somewhat clearer image of the Strengers' married life. While her husband was off leading military campaigns, Anna would seek comfort in the arms of a childhood friend.<br><br>Once the baron discovered the truth, he fell into an indescribable fury and killed Anna's lover, something which, predictably enough, further deepened the chasm separating the couple.<br>
   1062235|00000000||During his search for Anna Geralt discovered, to his great astonishment, that she and the gray-haired old woman in the swamp were one and the same person. The marks on her hands seemed to be symbols of some mysterious pact she had made with the Crones.<br>
   1062236|00000000||The situation grew even more entangled when Geralt discovered that, after fleeing Crow's Perch, Anna had been taken captive by some gigantic beast who carried her off into the darkness. As If that weren't horror enough, eyewitness testimony claimed her hands had burned with strange, glowing symbols shortly before this.<br><br>Perhaps this was precisely what the talisman Anna had received from the pellar had been meant to guard against?<br>
   1062245|00000000||Tamara only deepened Geralt's sad understanding of her mother's situation. The women had decided to flee together because they had had enough of the baron's drunken rages and beatings. Anna hated her husband so much that she was ready to do anything in order to be free of the man - and the child he had put inside her.<br>
   1062246|00000000||Geralt put the facts together and realized the old woman in the swamps was, in fact, Anna, the baron's missing wife. He also learned that the signs on her hands were symbols of the pact she had made with the Crones in order to get rid of her unwanted child.<br>
   1062249|00000000||Anna was found in the end, but the events she had witnessed and took part in had left such a deep mark on her body and mind that she would never again be the same. Her mind had quite simply cracked under the weight of it all, dropping her into an abyss of horror and despair.<br>
   1062250|00000000||Though Anna was found in the end, she was no longer herself, for a terrible curse had transformed her into a monster. The witcher had a good idea who had prepared this fate for her.<br>
   1062251|00000000||Geralt's suspicions were confirmed shortly thereafter. The curse afflicting the unfortunate woman was indeed the Crones' doing. Anna had turned to the ghastly sisters because she did not wish to give birth to the baron's child.<br><br>The Crones granted her wish in their own, twisted way: with a curse which made the fetus inside her wither on the vine, taking Anna's life energy with it. In despair she turned to the pellar, who made her a talisman to hamper the evil magic's influence. Anna had lost this during her fight with the baron and was thus rendered defenseless against the Crones' magic.<br><br>After that, the worst was free to happen - the markings on her palms began to burn and a fiend dragged her to the heart of Crookback Bog, where she paid back her debt as the Crones' slave.<br>
   1062252|00000000||Geralt snapped the evil spell afflicting Anna, restoring her true form. Yet the Crones had a included one last nasty pinch of vengeance in their vile brew that caused Anna to die as soon as she regained her freedom.<br><br>Anna's loved ones had time only for a brief farewell before she parted.<br>

Yet the Crones had a included one last nasty pinch of vengeance in their vile brew that caused Anna to die as soon as she regained her freedom.<br><br>Tamara and the baron had time only for a brief farewell before she parted.<br>
   1062356|00000000||Despite the witcher's best efforts, he did not succeed in lifting Anna's curse. To the despair and horror of all who witnessed it, Anna Strenger died a horrible death, incinerated by the Crones' last act of vengeance.

   1077606|00000000||<i>Folk say water hags are drowners' wives. If that be true, 'tain't no wonder why they're such ornery bitches.</i><br>– Shemhel of Dregsdon<br><br>Some tales mention water hags and swamp bints masquerading as lost old women to lure travelers back to the rickety shacks they build in the wetlands. In truth, only a blind man, or a sighted man blinded with drink, could mistake the rank sludge and rotting carrion of a water hag's den for a cozy cottage, and the hideous hag herself for an innocent grandmother. Their wrinkled, wart-covered bodies stand nearly two yards tall, with skin the color of a long-dead cadaver and stinking of muck and fish. Bony growths two spans long stick out from their backs, with hair like a tangle of seaweed and claws that would make a werewolf proud completing the picture.<br>
   1077607|00000000||Like drowners, with whom they often share hunting grounds, water hags and swamp bints dwell near shallow streams, rivers and wetlands. Though bulky, they are excellent swimmers. They can even swim through thick mud with astonishing agility, surfacing beside their victims to attack them with their sickle-shaped claws. They are also able to form this mud into balls, which they toss to temporarily blind opponents.<br><br>Water hags are particularly active and dangerous during rainstorms, conditions which furthermore hinder the use of the Igni Sign, usually the most effective weapon against all moisture-loving creatures.

   1054248|00000000||While in the passageways underneath Novigrad (I've been there as well, and don't recommend them as tourist destinations - if the stench doesn't get you, the monsters will) Geralt met a scholar who was excavating in search of traces of long-lost cultures. The professor asked Geralt for help removing the lid from a certain ancient sarcophagus.<br>
   1054251|00000000||Geralt decided to promote the advancement of knowledge and help the scholar open the sarcophagus. Instead of the expected withered skeleton, inside lay a fully fleshy vampire. He was not hostile at first and merely asked for a bit of peace and quiet while he finished his rest. The scholar, however, had no intention of respecting this wish. Geralt could not stop him and... the vampire lost his temper and attacked Geralt and the bothersome professor. Whether he wanted to or not, Geralt now had to end its life.

With the notes on the plague she took from Mouse Tower in hand, she presented herself to King Radovid. She was counting on obtaining a royal amnesty in return for the possibility the plague could be turned into a weapon to wield against Radovid's enemies. But she forgot one important detail - never deal with a devil, and especially not a devil backed by armies and with a fierce hatred of sorceresses. <br><br>Radovid laughed in her face, arrested Keira and had her impaled on a pike. She died in hideous agony, screaming curses against Radovid and his kingdom that echoed through the streets of Novigrad. <br><br>When Geralt returned to town, Triss asked him to help retrieve her body and give it a proper burial.<br>

   1077597|00000000||<i>If night ever catches you in the swamps, stay put and wait for dawn, even if it means standing waist-deep in water with leeches crawling down your trousers. Most important of all, if you see a light in the fog, never, and I mean never, go towards it.</i><br>– Johannes Strudd, guide<br><br>Fog is the traveler's foe. In the forest, it can make one lose one's way , at sea, it can send one sailing into the rocks. Yet such dangers are nothing compared to the monsters known as foglets which sometimes lurk within it. These creatures have powerful arms and claws like Zerrikanian kinjals, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters.
   1077596|00000000||Foglets may appear wherever thick fog can arise: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes.  If no fog is forthcoming, they create or summon it themselves. Quickly thickening air undisturbed by the wind infallibly signals a foglet is present - and preparing an attack. <br><br>Thick clouds of mist not only allow foglets to remain unseen, but also serve as their weapons. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. <br><br>Even if a traveler spies his pursuer and manages to attack, the foglet can disappear into thin air before the blade hits its target. Some foglets are additionally said to possess an ability to create complicated illusions rivaling that of human mages. Whether that is true or merely one of the dark legends men tell about these mysterious monsters remains uncertain.<br><br>When fighting foglets, a witcher must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues a witcher has to their location. Casting the Aard Sign at these beings will cause them to become tangible, giving purchase to blades and other weapons.

   1060714|00000000||Though Cerys' decision to stake a claim to Skellige's throne came as a shock to everyone else, she had thought it over quite thoroughly beforehand. Striving as always to outdo her brother, she intended to perform a great deed that would earn her widespread recognition and respect.<br><br>That is why she had sailed to Spikeroog to free Jarl Udalryk from the strange affliction that seemed to curse him.<br>
   1060715|00000000||Cerys did what she set out to do - with the witcher's help she freed clan Brokvar's leader from the wraith that had tormented him for years.<br>
   1060716|00000000||Cerys accepted her defeat in her race for the crown against her brother Hjalmar with dignity. She also made it clear beyond all doubt that the new leader of Skellige had her full support.<br>
   1060717|00000000||Once again Sparrowhawk gave proof of her cunning, this time by unmasking Birna's plot and cleansing the shame from her clan's name after the infamous "bloody banquet" at Kaer Trolde.<br>
   1060718|00000000||All these feats convinced the Skelligers that Cerys was fit to be queen. Though it was clear it would take some time before the young ruler could step entirely out of her father and brother's shadow, the greater part of the islanders were pleased and proud with their choice of ruler.<br>
   1060719|00000000||Sadly Crach's daughter died alongside her brother during a failed attack on the Nilfgaardian fleet. The inhabitants of Skellige long mourned the brave Sparrowhawk's premature death.

   1053176|00000000||On a small beach on the shores of Undvik Geralt came across a man chained to the rocks, the tide threatening to engulf him. The man begged for mercy, swearing he had been framed for murder and unjustly punished.<br>
   1053190|00000000||In the village near the site of the man's punishment a group was preparing to bury the person the chained man had supposedly killed. Geralt's attention was drawn by a sobbing girl. He talked to her and learned the child blamed herself for her brother's death. When pressed for the reason why, she explained that her false accusations had caused her brother to fly into a rage and kill her uncle. In Skellige, there was only one punishment for killing a family member in cold blood: a slow death by the sea's embrace...<br>
   1053177|00000000||Geralt was convinced by the accused man's testimony and freed him from his chains.
   1053178|00000000||Geralt did not believe the chained man's testimony and left him chained to the rocks, to meet his end at the mercy of the waves and the beasts of the sea.

    481366|00000000||Legend claims the warriors of Spikeroog had tested their mettle in the arena found near the cliffs on the northwestern edge of the isle for centuries. Sadly, an unfortunate recent event had led to the arena being haunted by the ghost of a defeated warrior. Geralt agreed to send the wraith off into the afterlife for good.<br>

   1059720|00000000||In those days rampant persecution and the smoke of a hundred pyres choked Novigrad's air. This grim climate provided cover in which a great many bloody butchers built comfortable nests for themselves. Drummed-up conspiracies, mass arrests and show trials resulting in group executions were the favorite building blocks.<br><br>Caleb Menge, the fanatically ambitious commander of the Church of the Eternal Fire's Temple Guard, was one such opportunist, his moment of triumph coming when he unmasked his superior, the former Temple Guard commander Chappelle, as a doppler in disguise.<br><br>Geralt first saw Menge lighting Chappelle's pyre in Novigrad's main square and had no doubt that, for this man, the appellation "fanatical whoreson" was too mild by far.<br><br>

   1077907|00000000||<i>Out at sea, if you hear a beautiful woman singing, turn the ship around at once. You understand? Even if it means sailing straight back into a storm.</i><br>– Arike of Hindarsfjall, advice given to his son before his first solo voyage <br><br>Like skilled hunters setting out wooden ducks to lure in drakes, sirens and lamias lure men near - using their own bodies as decoys. They can transform to resemble beautiful human maidens, though with tails covered in silver scales instead of legs. Once a naive sailor gets within arm's reach of these beautiful creatures, their fair faces suddenly turn to fang-filled, fish-like maws, and lovely tails promising unknown delights become sharp, death dealing talons.<br>
   1077908|00000000||One legend claims sirens and lamias were once friendly towards men – and supposedly were even known (albeit on rare occasions) to accept some sailors' clumsy attempts at courtship. In our day, however, they are decidedly aggressive, perhaps soured by the numerous kidnappings of carried out by frustrated sea salts. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: these days the monsters display no signs of good will, and so when spotting them one should immediately reach for one's silver sword. <br><br>Sirens and lamias (the sirens' more dangerous cousins) usually hunt in flocks, making use of their numbers as well as their ability to move effortlessly through water and air.<br><br>On the ground, however, they are virtually defenseless, and so a wise tactic is to damage their fin-like wings to force them to land. The Igni Sign also proves effective when fighting against them. Threatened or injured sirens will let out a terrifying shriek, leaving their opponents stunned while they escape – and their sisters swoop down for an easy attack.

   1048608|00000000||One thing about Geralt - he loves to meander. Instead of sitting in an inn near a warm stove, he is always putzing around fields and woods looking for gods-know-what. During one such stroll through the charming environs of Velen, he happened across tracks left by some kind of monster. Though he had no contract to kill any such beast, his witcher heart started racing at once...<br>
   1048609|00000000||It turned out a cockatrice had left the tracks. As this beast's name implies, it looks something like a rooster crossed with a basilisk and, according to Geralt, tastes a bit like chicken.<br>

He died on the spot, along with his squire, his guide, the beaters, his peasant entourage and his hounds.</i><br>– Kavin Jell, manager of the Villepin Estate near Vizima<br><br>Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads. Like their rarer cousins, bumbakvetches, they live in thick forests, swamps and bogs. When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible, they kill them, and without much difficulty.<br>
   1077925|00000000||Their size alone makes fiends and bumbakvetches extremely dangerous – one blow from their powerful paws can kill a horse along with its fully-armored mount. Their enormous heft also makes them invulnerable to Aard: even witchers specializing in the power of Signs could not move one even an inch. Furthermore, any wounds they receive heal at lightning speed.<br><br>If that weren't trouble enough, fiends need not rely on their strength and stamina alone when fighting. They can also call on a more refined weapon: the third eye located in the center of their forehead, which they use to draw their prey into a state of hypnosis. During these times their victim does not see anything beyond this single burning eye – the last thing they see before their death. <br><br>A fiend's only weakness is its fear of loud noises – bombs such as Samum or Devil's Puffball are thus quite effective when fighting this monster. Furthermore, a blade covered in relict oil can increase a witcher's chances of victory – or at least of walking away from the fight.

   1055706|00000000||Geralt is hardly an ace gambler. He has had a few good runs in dice poker tournaments, true, but these were always local affairs against opponents whose skill level left much to be desired. A tournament in the world's greatest metropolis - now that was a horse of an entirely different color. The high entry fee and stringent deck requirements scared off amateurs, so only wealthy professionals had signed up. Everything was in place for play at a high level in exciting company - in other words, my friends, for pure pleasure.<br>
   1055709|00000000||A halfling by the name of Bernard was revealed to be the thief. This supposed farmer took the coin and hid with it in one of the city's warehouses. The witcher raced after him and defeated him in a final showdown.<br><br>As for Sasha, she turned out to be a Nilfgaardian agent known as Cantarella. Her cover blown, she had needed the coin so that she could skip town. Later I learned that she did in fact successfully make it south - but that is another story altogether.
   1055707|00000000||Perhaps Geralt would even have been tempted by Sasha's proposition. Before he could accept or reject it, however, another double dealer made his presence known. While they were talking one of the participants stole the coin set aside for the reward, beating Sasha to the punch.<br>

Her cover blown, she had needed the coin so that she could skip town. As part of my duties as a chronicler I must note that before she left, she spent a night with the witcher, conducting various covert operations until the break of dawn.
   1091038|00000000||Yet Geralt did not manage to garner the tournament's grand prize. Such is life - you can't win them all, sadly. Geralt could only hope luck's cruelty at cards meant she would shower him with good fortune when it came to love.
   1055708|00000000||It started with an indecent proposal. Sasha, one of the participants in the tournament, made Geralt a proposition so brazen even his jaded jaw dropped: together they were to steal the coin set aside as the tournament's prize.<br>

   1083255|00000000||On the Isle of Mists, where the elven mage had concealed her, Geralt found Ciri at last. They could not celebrate their reunion, for the Wild Hunt descended on them. They fled, Ciri teleporting them both to Kaer Morhen, where their friends awaited.
   1083256|00000000||Insistent in its pursuit of the woman witcher, the Wild Hunt arrived at Kaer Morhen soon after. A great battle ensued, and the defenders of the fortress might all have perished had Ciri not demonstrated her magic powers.

   1049718|00000000||Keira Metz had helped Geralt in his search for Ciri, so the witcher decided to return the favor. The sorceress sought a magic lamp which the mysterious elven mage had promised to give her. Since the object was nowhere in sight, our heroes drew the only possible conclusion: that it lay concealed somewhere in the underground passageways.<br>
   1049719|00000000||Their intuition proved sound. In the end Keira found the lamp she had sought, and our heroes could return to the surface. Their trek underground had made friends of them, so Keira asked Geralt to come by her hut, as she could use some companionship in her lonely backwoods exile.

   1051806|00000000||Though Ermion was incensed (no druidic pun intended) at Yennefer and Geralt's theft and desecration of an ancient artifact, he was willing to put his anger aside to help them find Ciri. He told them of the Hunt's recent destruction of the village of Lofoten. Geralt and Yennefer knew at once it could not have been a chance attack. Ciri. They went there looking for her.
   1051818|00000000||Geralt and Yennefer's suspicions were soon confirmed. Ciri had indeed been seen in Lofoten right before the Wild Hunt appeared. Yet none who had survived the village's devastation knew what she had been doing there or where she had gone. They all agreed that the only one who might know more about her fate was a man now known only as Craven. This individual had behaved disgracefully during the Hunt's attack, for which crime he had been stripped of his name and expelled from the community. He had  then set out to redeem himself by defeating the monster dwelling in Freya's garden... and never returned.

Pirates were currently engaged in looting anything of value that had survived and Geralt decided he should try to inform someone with a right to the goods before they finished the job.<br>
   1051224|00000000||Geralt found a merchant who knew the captain of the wrecked ship. He promised he would round up some men and retrieve the cargo, hoping to salvage at least a portion of the lost goods for the rightful owner's family.

   1053028|00000000||Like always, Geralt successfully saved the damsel in distress. He got rid of the band of drunks and received a small purse and a grateful smile as his reward. The latter was what he prized the most.

   1058832|00000000||As is often the case with charmers, diviners, healers and other such cunning folk of the countryside, the pellar of Blackbough was a man of mystery, around whom circled a great many rumors and legends. Some claimed he could commune with the dead, others, that he had a different sort of familiarity with the grave, having put an axe in his father's head in a fit of rage when he was a young man. Still others said he showed an indecent fondness for barnyard animals.<br><br>All of these rumors aroused the fear and respect of the backwater peasants of Velen, and the pellar most likely did little to discourage them.<br>
   1058833|00000000||Yet even the most cunning of men make the occasional professional error - had Geralt not intervened, who knows what might have become of the old seer at the hands of the Baron's enraged men.<br>
   1058835|00000000||The pellar turned out to be more skilled at soothsaying than curing indigestion. Though what he divined for Geralt was murky at best, the witcher managed to put the pieces together into a somewhat logical whole.<br>
   1058836|00000000||Sometime after that the old pellar asked Geralt to help him hold Forefathers' Eve. When witch hunters sought to break up the ritual, Geralt defended its participants and earned the soothsayer's trust and respect.<br>
   1058837|00000000||Sometime after that the old pellar asked Geralt to help him hold Forefathers' Eve. Yet when witch hunters arrived and broke up the ritual, Geralt did nothing to stop them, greatly upsetting the soothsayer.<br>
   1058838|00000000||Many people have proverbial skeletons in their closet that they would be aghast to have exposed to the public eye. One can thus imagine the pellar's horror when his darkest secret literally emerged from the grave during Forefathers' Eve in the form of his murdered father's ghost. To the unfortunate shaman's further horror, old man Ambros was clearly out for revenge.<br>
   1058839|00000000||Yet Geralt intervened and the pellar was saved from otherworldly vengeance. The circumstances of the murder were explained, and the pellar, though still guilty of murder, was revealed to be a victim in his own right. By helping the pellar do battle with the demons of his past, Geralt earned himself the old man's undying gratitude.<br>

   1051197|00000000||Geralt has a "live and let live" policy regarding the gods and their worshipers:  if they don't bother him, he returns the favor. Sadly, not everyone follows this sage precept. A distraught woman in Velen informed him someone had been destroying the shrines that dot that region's roadsides. She begged him to repair the damage and, if possible, punish those responsible. Though he did not share the woman's devotion or outrage at this sacrilege, he decided to help all the same.<br>
   1051198|00000000||While following the trail of damaged holy sites Geralt encountered a group of young men who, he learned, were students at Oxenfurt Academy. Influenced by some radical philosopher, they had taken up arms in the battle against religion. As is often the case with students, what began as a measured discussion of worldviews ended in a brawl.

   1077868|00000000||<i>Our winter's cold and deep, frostbite eats your feet, snow falls down and hides the ground and ice trolls wake from sleep!</i><br>– folk song heard in northern Kaedwen<br><br>Climbing to the top of snow-covered peaks is never a safe endeavor. One can slip and fall into a ravine, be buried in an avalanche – or stumble across ice trolls. Unlike the rock trolls found at lower altitudes, these permafrost-dwelling monsters treat every man they encounter as a possible ingredient for a tasty meal.<br>
   1077869|00000000||Luckily ice trolls live atop high mountain ridges so inaccessible they rarely encounter humans, and some suppose this is why they have not mastered the basics of Common Speech. Others claim their harsh mountain home has stripped them of an ability they once possessed, for in a land of never-ending cold there is no room for mercy or understanding.<br><br>Ice trolls are crueler than their rocky kin. Though they use similar tactics in battle – tossing stones and swinging with their mighty fists – they are heartier and stronger than rock trolls and thus more dangerous. Like rock trolls, their backs are covered in thick protective armor, meaning one should never strike them from the rear. Meanwhile their mass means that the Aard Sign cannot move them. Lastly, never think of attacking them during a blizzard. At such times they draw power from the surrounding cold and fight with increased strength.

   1051856|00000000||It is a truth universally acknowledged that children only prove more troublesome as they mature. In Crach's case, any troubles his offspring had caused him only doubled after King Bran's death, when both his son and daughter joined the ranks of the claimants of Skellige's throne.<br>Tradition demanded the next king be a great hero, and Hjalmar, Crach's son, felt he fit the bill perfectly. As anyone versed in fable knows, there is no more fitting way to prove oneself a hero than to kill a giant - and it so happened there was one such beast in desperate need of slaughtering on the nearby isle of Undvik. Thus Hjalmar had organized an expedition and set off to earn his glory. Unfortunately, there'd been no word of him since and the jarl had begun to worry. Like many before and after him, he took this worry to the witcher.
   1051857|00000000||Helping Hjalmar an Craite did not prove easy. Undvik had gone feral after the ice giant drove its inhabitants away, with monsters running amok on the island as though it were some mad mage's experiment or a misguided entrepreneur's attempt at an innovative hunting preserve. Yet in the end the witcher triumphed, not only finding Crach's son, but also helping him kill the giant and avenge the men the beast had murdered. His heroic deed accomplished, Hjalmar could now leap out of the starting blocks in the race for the Skellige crown.
   1060561|00000000||Geralt searched every inch of Undvik until he finally came across Hjalmar near the giant's lair. Hjalmar had journeyed there to free Vigi, one of the members of his crew. As he deemed the cause a worthy one, Geralt decided to lend Hjalmar his sword.<br>
   1060560|00000000||Geralt set out to find Hjalmar an Craite, but first came across the lad's companion in arms, a man by the name of Folan. Folan told the witcher that Hjalmar's crew had scattered when the giant attacked. As for the fate of Hjalmar himself - that Folan could not tell him.<br>
   1087108|00000000||Geralt agreed to help Hjalmar, true, but as I consider the matter now, with the benefit of hindsight, I can't help but think he only did so to spare old Crach's feelings. For - if I may speak frankly, Dear Reader - the witcher went about finishing the job like a man whose intentions were firm but his flesh... lacking. In brief, he saw to other, more important matters, hoping Hjalmar would  handle the giant on his own. Perhaps he counted on that an Craite blood showing its virile power once more...

   1050623|00000000||When a witcher investigates, he expects to uncover the unexpected. He will learn, for example, that it was not a monster but the owner's brother who waylaid a missing caravan, or that the werewolf thought responsible for a streak of bloody murders would in truth never harm a fly.<br><br>Yet no investigation in witcher history had brought as many surprises as the search for Ciri. At one point Geralt discovered the key to finding her was a repulsive, brainless creature he called Uma. The witcher could sense this ugly being was no child of Mother Nature - even she could never be so cruel - but the result of sorcery. In other words, its deformed flesh was but a sort of magical cage in which someone else was trapped. The question was - who?<br><br>Geralt decided to take Uma to Kaer Morhen, so that he and his fellow witchers could confer about how to lift its curse.<br>
   1050624|00000000||It turned out to be Avallac'h - a powerful elven Sage whom Geralt had encountered during his previous adventures. Breaking his curse proved extraordinarily difficult and, though the treatments succeeded, they had deposited the elf on the brink of death.<br><br>Luckily, he still had a sound mind in his tattered body and was able to pass on the message they had waited so long to hear - Ciri was alive. Avallac'h had hidden her from the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists, a place tucked outside of time and space.<br><br>Yet even there she was not truly safe and, sooner or later, the wraiths would find her. It was clear to everyone that fleeing and hiding once more would only delay the inevitable. Geralt thus decided to fetch Ciri from the Isle of Mists and, with her and his friends at his side, give fight to her pursuers.
   1051290|00000000||Geralt knew Uma currently resided at Crow's Perch. The baron's bandits, hungry for a bit of unrefined entertainment, had made Uma their jester. Geralt knew he would have to put an end to this farce, take the unfortunate being from Velen and, with Yennefer's help, try to lift the curse that held him.<br>
   1051291|00000000||Before this could happen, however, Geralt once again had the honor to face the emperor of Nilfgaard. Emhyr had run out of patience and demanded that Geralt report back on any progress he had made in his search for Ciri. Geralt presented Uma to the emperor and explained the unsightly fellow's role in the investigation. The emperor had hoped Geralt would return with someone other than a demented monstrosity, but ultimately recognized the creature as a solid lead in the search for his daughter Cirilla and handed over a portion of the reward he had promised the witcher. Geralt never revealed exactly how much that amounted to - he never did place much value on coin - but I wager, dear reader, it considerably exceeded the standard fees witchers received.<br><br>During the audience Yennefer hit upon an idea for lifting Uma's curse - though, not for the first time, she refused to share any details with Geralt. She merely told him to ride as fast as possible for Kaer Morhen, the famous keep of the witchers from the School of the Wolf - the home Geralt had not seen for some time, save in his dreams.

    579806|00000000||The White Wolf.
    579808|00000000||Looking for work, master witcher? In Novigrad?
    579810|00000000||Kingslayer… You kill emperors, too?
   1086966|00000000||The vengeful wraith known as the White Lady had roamed the fields for a long time, murdering anyone she came across. Though the grain hung heavy from the stalks, the frightened peasants were kept from harvesting it and thus faced famine. They gathered their last bit of savings and went in together on a bounty for a witcher. That was coin well-spent.
   1087328|00000000||<i>Micko and his band? Who're they?<br>Four lads, drunkards and good-for-nothin's, all. They'd drained a few pints and decided they'd all plough the White Lady, maybe then she'd bugger off.</i><br>– Conversation overheard in a field outside Novigrad<br>
   1081909|00000000||The apparition haunting the fields outside Novigrad turned out to be a noonwraith. Some powerful emotion must have bound it to that place - love, hate, anger or perhaps all three at once. Like every wraith of this type, she was surely capable of forming mirror images of herself, which served to mislead opponents and restore her vitality. Luckily, these mirages could be dispelled with a quick slash from a silver blade. Like any noonwraith, she would undoubtedly seek to assume immaterial form while fighting, making her almost impossible to injure - unless she is first caught in a trap laid by the Yrden Sign, or blasted with a special bomb. Once thus forced into materiality, she should be attacked with strong blows or the Igni Sign. Finally, one must always keep in mind two witcher sayings: "The longer you fight a noonwraith, the lower your chances of surviving," and "Fight a noonwraith at midday and you'll be dead before dusk."
   1081908|00000000||The White Lady
   1077783|00000000||<i>Forktails… Bah! Fuckers' tails're more like cleavers.</i><br>– Yavinn Buck, veteran of the Mahakaman Volunteer Regiment<br><br>Forktails owe their quaint name to the long, sharp growths at the tip of their tails. A blow from this weapon can slice an oaken shield in two – along with the arm that was carrying it. Thus, though its name conjures images of cutlery, fighting a forktail is nothing like a dinner party and ends in death rather than dessert.<br>
   1077784|00000000||Forktails are active by day. They usually hunt alone or, more rarely, in pairs. They attack big game, including domesticated animals, mainly cattle and pigs, and even humans from time to time.<br><br>Like all draconids their massive size does not stop them from flying and attacking from the air. They use their weight and height advantage as they swoop down to knock their prey over with their wings. Once on the ground, they are somewhat less mobile but still dangerous, turning to other tactics centered on attacking with their massive, spike-covered tails.
   1077488|00000000||Forktails
    516716|00000000||Aye, felt it comin' in me bones.

   1062440|00000000||In times of war one often encounters those who have suffered cruelly at the hands of fate. Geralt was thus not shocked to meet the woman who the children in the Velen swamps called Gran, though she seemed to have suffered manifold unspecified ills.<br><br>Whatever her woes, it was clear she cared for the war orphans in her charge with love and devotion.<br>
   1062444|00000000||Gran bore strange marks on her hands that burned with living fire. In time they proved to be signs of her indentured servitude to the Crones. How exactly the old woman had come to be in their power, however, remained unknown.<br>
   1062445|00000000||When Geralt heard from the fisherman about burning marks on Anna’s hands, he quickly added one and one to draw a conclusion. Though recent events had changed her nearly beyond all recognition, the Gran he had met in the swamps must have been the Bloody Baron’s wife.<br>
   1062446|00000000||When Geralt saw the marks on the woman’s hands, he quickly realized she must be the Bloody Baron’s wife, though changed beyond all recognition by the hardship she had suffered.<br>
   1086543|00000000||Geralt's first attempts to talk to her came to nothing. He was only able to break through her mistrust with the help of a godling named Johnny. A few words from the latter convinced Gran to help Geralt talk to the mysterious Ladies of the Wood.<br>

   1222822|00000000||While passing the infamous Devil's Pit, Geralt overheard the desperate pleas of prayer - a prayer he answered.<br><br>A young deacon of the Church of the Eternal Fire asked the witcher for aid. It turned out a gang of deserters had taken hold of an abandoned mine, now long haunted by a mysterious specter thought to spread pestilence. Geralt must deal with this plague spirit or risk releasing it unto the world.
   1222968|00000000||Three hundred long years had filled Reinald with bitterness and spite. He was driven by a singular goal: to exact revenge on the Church of the Eternal Fire in any way he could, no matter the cost. Shortly after meeting with the young cleric, the witcher's ghost murdered the lad in cold blood, destroying his own essence in the process.
   1222967|00000000||In a peculiar twist of fate, it turned out Reinald, a witcher of the Wolf School, had already been possessed by the red miasmal for hundreds of years. Fortunately, Geralt managed to defeat the specter, thus freeing the soul of his ancient brother in arms.
   1222969|00000000||Geralt dared not risk another life at Reinald's word. Instead, he salted and burned the witcher's body to destroy his tormented ghost, thus preventing it from ever becoming a vengeful wraith.
   1222970|00000000||With the young cleric's aid, Geralt managed to quell Reinald's anger and help him find peace at long last.

    363506|00000000||<i>Vedymins, known also as witchers - a mysterious and elite caste of warriors </i>cum<i> priests. According to folk beliefs, they possessed magical powers and superhuman abilities, which they then used to fight evil spirits, monsters and other malevolent powers.</i><br>--Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, vol. XV <br><br> I know witchers just a bit less thoroughly then poetry and the fair sex -- meaning, I know them very well. During one of my many adventures, I befriended not just the famed Geralt of Rivia, but also his teacher, Vesemir, as well as his confreres, Lambert and Eskel. But enough about me. <br><br> In a nutshell, witchers are monster slayers for hire. They fight beasts with a silver-plated sword and simple spells known as Signs. The witchers' excellence in swordfighting is the result of years of excruciating training and magically induced mutations which greatly enhance their senses and reflexes. Unfortunately, these mutations, achieved through a rite called the Trial of the Grasses, are extremely dangerous and more often than not end in a long and painful death.<br><br> As a result of many provocations and slanderous gossip, witchers became first feared and then hated, leading in turn to persecution and pogroms which very nearly put an end to their caste. Yet some of them survived and ply their peculiar trade to this day, traveling back and forth across the Northern Realms, killing monsters for a small fee.
   1066550|00000000||<i>If I hear anyone say Temeria has ceased to exist, I will smack him in the face. With brass knuckles.</i><br>--Vernon Roche, former head of Temerian Special Forces. <br><br>Until recently, Temeria was considered the most powerful of the Northern Realms. Together with its allies, it was thought capable of standing up to the ever more aggressive Empire of Nilfgaard. However, King Foltest's tragic death proved Temeria a giant with feet of clay. Left without its ruler, it was unable to withstand yet another incursion from the south. Just months after the offensive began, the silver lilies flying over Vizima were replaced by banners bearing the Great Sun, the symbol of the empire.<br><br>Though most Temerians gave up all hope, some never came to terms with the humiliating defeat and their beloved country's eradication from the world map. Hiding in the dense forests of Angren and the mountains of Mahakam, they wait impatiently for an occasion to take up arms and fight the odious oppressor.
   1068409|00000000||<i>Redania is the oldest of the dh'oine kingdoms. I remember its beginnings very clearly. All those broken oaths, rapes and murders... </i><br>--Ida Emean, elven Sage <br><br>I find it hard to write about Redania objectively, as it is there that I, Dandelion, came into this world -- a truly momentous event, noted by all respected historians (who, for some inscrutable reason, insist of adding me a few years).<br><br>But back to Redania. The kingdom is currently ruled by Radovid the Fifth, very rightly nicknamed "The Stern", an irreconcilable enemy of all mages and sorcerers. Its emblem -- a white eagle painted on a red field, its capital -- Tretogor, built upon the ruins of an elven city. Among the other urban centers one should definitely name Oxenfurt, home to the world-famous Academy, and the port of Blaviken, where Geralt gained the nickname "Butcher" after killing (in a rather cruel fashion, I must add) the renegade princess Renfri and her brigands.<br><br>Recently, Redania has greatly increased its territory by deceitfully taking over the lands of its neighbor and erstwhile ally, Kaedwen. Radovid, who was expected to defend all Northern Kingdoms from the Nilfgaardian invasion, turned out to be a ruthless aggressor himself.
   1068418|00000000||<i>There is no up-to-date map of Nilfgaard. For it just keeps growing.</i><br>-Amerigo Veltucci, cartographer<br><br>Until about a quarter century ago, only the well educated had even heard of Nilfgaard. Back then the empire, though already expanding, had not yet cast its shadow over the Northern Realms. Today, when its black-clad legions have carried banners bearing the Great Sun across the Yaruga all the way to the southern banks of the Pontar, no man in the North does not know the empire's name - and does not tremble upon hearing it.<br><br>Nilfgaard is currently ruled by Emhyr var Emreis, a great politician and strategist. The country consists of about a half dozen provinces, formed from once-conquered lands, and numerous satellite states such as Ebbing, Salm, Toussaint, Maecht, Metinna or Cintra. The latter, though formally independent, are in fact governed directly by the emperor.<br><br>For such a diverse and quickly expanding state, Nilfgaard is surprisingly stable. In recent memory, no rebellion, uprising or domestic war has upset the famed <i>Pax Nilfgaardiana</i>. This might derive from the fact that Nilfgaardians cherish order above all else, including wars and conquest - and  respect laws and courts to an extent unparalleled anywhere in the North.
   1068419|00000000||<i>You might be rich back home in Redania, mate, but here in Kovir you'd be a shoeshine at most... If you'd pay the one thousand marks entry fee at the Shoeshine Guild, that is.</i><br>--Joulke van Henning, townswoman from Lan Exeter. <br><br>Kovir and Poviss were once a dirt-poor, backward province of Redania. Rocky shores, barren fields and god-awful weather deterred all but the most desperate outcasts and exiles from settling there. But the picture had changed dramatically once all but inexhaustible natural riches were discovered under the snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountains. Since then, in less than two centuries, Kovir and Poviss not only managed to secure independence, but became the richest of the Northern Kingdoms.<br><br>Today, the kingdom's power rests on a healthy economy and commerce, and its sovereignty is secured by both extensive trade agreements and legions of very well paid mercenaries. Kovir and Poviss are also reputed to be the most tolerant and enlightened of the Northern Realms, meaning that persecuted mages and non-humans often flee there, seeking refuge.

The Eternal Fire is… hope itself.</i><br>- Chappelle, Commander, Temple Guard of the Church of the Eternal Fire. <br><br>The cult of the Eternal Fire came into being a few centuries past in the Free City of Novigrad. The undying flame, symbolizing hope, is its chief symbol. As the years passed, the cult gained popularity, eventually becoming the dominant religion in the North.<br><br>Initially tolerant of other faiths, the cult of the Eternal Fire grew increasingly radical with time. As the fire which was supposed to drive off darkness began sprouting beneath pyres, its flame, once the symbol of hope, became a sign of terror and oppression. Anyone can become the Eternal Fire's foe, be he mage, alchemist, elf, dwarf... or witcher.
   1068421|00000000||<i>Anyone in possession of information pertaining to the whereabouts of members of the despicable Lodge of Sorceresses, or rather Wicked Witches and Kingslayers, is obliged, under the pain of death penalty, to report immediately to our gracious ruler.</i><br>--Decree signed by Radovid the Stern <br><br> The Lodge was founded by a group of sorceresses from the Northern Realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard. Its aim was to guard and determine the future of the art of magic. Initially, this secret organization had a salutary influence -- for example, few know that it is thanks to these sorceresses that the Treaty of Cintra, which ended the Second War with Nilfgaard, was signed.<br><br>Unfortunately, initial successes convinced members of the Lodge of Sorceresses of their infallibility -- and affirmed the already strong conviction that a noble goal justifies all means. Instead of advising, mentoring and criticizing the world's rulers, sorceresses started working behind the scenes, pulling the strings and getting involved in morally dubious plots. As a result, the sorceresses were implicated in the so called "Assassinations of Kings", the chief victims of which were kings Demavend of Aedirn and Foltest of Temeria.<br><br>As it later turned out, the sorceresses were only pawns in the hands of emperor Emhyr var Emreis, who thus, in one masterful stroke, discredited Lodge's venerable members and got rid of the most important rulers of the Northern Realms.

The hell that's s'pposed to mean?</i><br>–Hans Schmetterling, Temple Guard corporal, on a ubiquitous Novigradian graffiti<br><br>The Temple Guard used to be Novigrad's secret service – one with a pretty awful reputation. It was credited with persecutions of the Hierarch's political opponents, forging documents, assassinations, kidnappings, blackmail, racketeering as well as good ol' robberies. When this particular story took place, their main task was to assist witch hunters in tracking down and killing the unfortunate mages who flocked to Novigrad hoping to avoid Radovid's persecutions.
   1068441|00000000||<i>Over the Pontar and through the woods, to Ban Glean we go, through the white and drifted snow!</i><br>--Folk song<br><br>Taking its source in the Blue Mountains, flowing from the East towards the West, Pontar used to be an important commercial waterway as well as a natural border between the kingdoms of Redania and Kaedwen on one side and Temeria and Aedirn on the other. Today, it is the last major strategic obstacle blocking the progress of the invading Nilfgaardian army.

Just as they did with the Vrans and werebbubbs. </i><br>--Latke Vicario, dwarven smith from the Vizima Outskirts <br><br>History of the dwarfs reaches back to the times from before the Conjunction of the Spheres. They are characterized by a meager height and stocky build, great diligence and an even greater love of gold. Humans think them honorable and reliable -- and, at the same time, boorish and rude. They are also known for their somewhat irrational fear for the safety of their less then attractive females, which, they deeply believe, all other races plot to kidnap for gods know what wicked purposes.<br><br>Dwarfs, pragmatic as ever, assimilated rather painlessly into the human society, adopting many habits of the dominating race. Still, they are often distrusted and mistreated -- and every once in a while some of them perish in pogroms directed against non-humans.<br><br>However, some more conservative dwarfs, especially those sympathizing with the Scoia'tael, refused to accept the human rule and hold their meeker kinsmen in deep contempt.

Truth is, it burst after a certain angry halfling flung a stone at him in revenge for trampling his carefully trimmed flower bed.</i><br>--Anna Hilger, washerwoman from Carreras <br><br>Great historians have precious little to say about the beginnings of this humble people. What is clear, however, is that they came into existence long before humans. Contrary to elves and dwarves, halflings offered no resistance to the Big People, as they call us, and chose to live peacefully under the human rule. This attitude earned them an unfair reputation of duffers and cowards and overshadowed their many virtues, such as resourcefulness and diligence.<br><br>Halflings are natural-born farmers and stock breeders, so it comes as little surprise that most of them live and work in the countryside. Those who do reside in human cities try their luck in commerce or run small workshops, breweries and inns. <br><br>Halflings' peaceful nature did not protect them from Big People's enmity and persecutions. However, when hard-pressed, jovial halflings prove to be able warriors, fighting furiously to protect their belongings and, above all, families -- those who put their kin in danger, no matter how big or powerful, should expect armed resistance. <br><br>During the previous war, there were many stories about deserters and bandits disappearing without a trace upon entering peaceful halfling villages. Most think these tales plucked out of the air. However, having seen halflings shoot arrows and fling stones with terrifying force and precision, I wouldn't be so sure.
   1068444|00000000||<i>O, Freya! Give me strength to love, to bear children, to give birth to warriors, to kill enemies!</i><br>--A prayer for Skellige girls<br><br>Among the many gods of the Skellige Isles, it is beyond doubt Freyja, the goddess of the hearth, love and fertility, who is regarded most highly and revered most fervently. Many think her identical with Melitele, worshiped on the continent -- but one should not mention this hypothesis to the islanders, for they think it a blasphemy and a grave insult.<br><br>Freya is also the protector of prophetesses, seers and telepaths, as illustrated by her attributes: Brisingamen, gem which allows seeing into the future, cat, which hears and sees what is hidden, and hawk, which watches from the above. Freya's main temple is located on the island of Hindar. It's surrounded by a holy grove, from where the sacred mistletoe, a key ingredient of each and every Skellige ritual, is harvested.

With time, all these minor deities become one – All-mother, or Melitele. <br><br>Unlike other old religions, which either fizzled out completely or became insignificant, limited to a few forgotten altars and isolated temples, the cult of Melitele holds strong. The goddess is revered by all women, irrespective of birth and station, and so no lord would consider hurting her priestesses, unless he wanted to upset the whole womanfolk – as well as his own wife.<br><br>The most important center of the cult of Melitele is undoubtedly Ellander, known across the whole world for its cloister, where future herbalists, doctors and midwives train under the watchful eye of sister Nenneke.

These talents usually remain dormant and undetected for a long time.

Such individuals usually move on to become powerful sorcerers.

Unless you mean somethin' else?</i><br>--Elke Vrijdek, townswoman from Ban Glean<br><br>An Unexpected Child is bound by the laws of destiny with the person to whom it had been promised, usually in return for a favor. One who wanted to invoke the Law of Surprise, upon hearing he will receive whatever he may wish in exchange for his assistance, uttered the following words: "you shall give me what you find back home that you did not expect." What is meant here is of course not a lover hiding under the wife's bed or mother-in-law who dropped by with an unannounced visit, but the child born or taken in during the absence of the person swearing the oath.<br><br>They say that children thus marked by the Fate grow up to do great things. The famous hero Zatret Voruta and Supree, who freed the Mad Deï from his curse, were Unexpected Children. One other such child was of course Ciri, Geralt's apprentice and adopted daughter.
   1068450|00000000||<i>Conjunction of the Spheres... Rings a bell... It's something about grammar, right?</i><br>--Overheard during a resit exam, Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Questions regarding the Conjunction of the Spheres inspire terror among Oxenfurt's students. This is because this event is almost impossible to grasp for the human mind. It's devilishly hard to understand it -- and explaining it is even worse. Therefore, instead of trying yet again to put it in words, I'm copying the answer from my own exam, marked E minus. Those who'd like to know more should consult an academic rather than a poet. <b><br><i>Conjunction of the Spheres is a magical cataclysm, which, by our calculation of the time, took place one thousand and five hundred years ago, give or take. As a result, our world became infested with, like, an awful lot of totally dangerous beings from all sorts of different times and dimensions, which we call monsters. Conjunction of the Spheres also gave birth to magic, </i>id est<i> a supernatural power which only a select few can bridle. The times of the Conjunction of the Spheres are remembered only by the oldest of elves -- and of course dean Haarer.</i>
   1068451|00000000||<i>Amid a starless night, the Alder Folk, the Aen Elle, will come, their faces painted with hoar-frost, their eyes pale like the moon...</i><br>--Elven prophecy, author unknown<br><br>The oldest legends of the Aen Seidhe elves mention a lost tribe -- Aen Elle, Elder Speech for Alder Folk. Their paths separated many centuries ago, we are told, when the Conjunction of the Spheres gave birth two dozens, if not hundreds of different worlds. Aen Elle settled down in one of them, creating their own kingdom. <br><br>It is hard to say anything about this race with certainty. All I know is that this elven tribe was reputed to be warlike and conquered many lands, destroying those who stood in its way without mercy.
   1068452|00000000||<i>If you hear hooves beating at night, but no one rides down the road... If you can see a blood-red glow on the horizon, but the air is free of smoke... If it suddenly gets cold, even though it was warm during the day... Collect your family forthwith, bar the door, close the shutters, extinguish the hearth and hide in the basement.</i><br>--Old Pellar's Nuggets, Second Edition <br><br>The Wild Hunt is a half-legendary cavalcade of ghastly specter riders, clad in rusty armors, galloping across the night sky on skeleton steeds. It's coming is interpreted as an infallible sign of coming war, hunger and disease.<br><br>Those who spot the Wild Hunt on the night sky, freeze in terror, and those who stand in its way, die or disappear without a trace. And this isn't just tall tales -- there are many reliable accounts of people purportedly carried away by the Wild Hunt. They sometimes return, many years later, not remembering a thing about their long captivity, looking exactly the same as they did on the day they were captured -- even though the graves of their loved ones have long been overgrown by grass and weeds.
   1068453|00000000||<i>You wanna sail to Skellige, eh? Why not slit yer throat 'ere n' now and save us all the hassle?</i><br>--Overheard in the harbor of Bremervoord<br><br>The rocky, inhospitable Skellige Archipelago consists of six major islands and dozens of smaller islets. Since times long past it has been home to a fierce and warlike nation of sailors, merchants and pirates. They value freedom above all else, and indeed even the simplest Skellige fishermen possess almost the same rights as their clan leaders, known as jarls. The latter, in turn, answer only to the king they elect from amongst themselves.<br><br>For a long time, Skellige was closely allied with Cintra. After Cintra fell to Nilfgaard, however, the islanders swore revenge on the empire and have since been its most irreconcilable and vicious enemy.
   1068454|00000000||<i>All dh'oine are savages... But the ones from Kaedwen are the worst. As if someone dressed hogs in jerkins on taught them to walk on hind legs.</i><br>--Toruviel, free elf from Dol Blathanna<br><br>To the east of Redania lies the youngest of the Northern Realms -- the vast and densely wooded Kaedwen. Its capital is Ard Carraigh, but the kingdom's true pearl is beyond all doubt the city of Ban Ard -- which fits this somewhat unrefined realm like a square peg in a round hole. <br><br>Kaedwen has always been a troublesome neighbor. For example, under the rule of king Henselt Kaedweni forces marched into Aedirn, formally an ally, taking advantage of the fact that its armies were preoccupied fighting the invading Nilfgaardians. Such traitorous deeds earned the Kaedweni a reputation of bandits and bastards -- whereas in fact they are generally a forthcoming and hospitable people. They are known for their coarse sense of humor and  famous sayings, such as "a whore won't score 'gainst ano'er whore", which indisputably contain some folk wisdom.<br><br>There's one other proverb which the fate of Kaedwen proved true -- "at length is the fox brought to the furrier." After years of harassing its neighbors, it was Kaedwen's turn to suffer. When Nilfgaardian armies invaded for the third time, king Radovid V The Stern of Redania did not rush to its aid, but instead defeated the overstretched Kaedweni forces in what can only be called a blitzkrieg and incorporated its lands into his own realm. And so today Ard Carraigh and all the important forts along the Pontar river are manned by soldiers flying the Redanian banner.
   1068508|00000000||<i>If we'll continue bickering among ourselves, Redania and Temeria will end up like Cintra. Black from the ashes and Nilfgaardian banners.</i><br>--Alexandre de Tocqueville, Temeria's ambassador in Redania, shortly before the fall of Vizima<br><br>The Kingdom of Cintra, lying on the southern banks of the Yaruga river, was in the way of Nilfgaard's expansion -- and so it was the first of the Northern Realms to fall to its might. When conquered, it was not incorporated into the empire -- instead, it remains a formally independent kingdom, ruled by a puppet monarch. <br><br>The fall of Cintra became a symbol of Nilfgaardian cruelty -- and the battle of the Marnadal Pass, in which the Cintran forces were eventually defeated in spite of outstanding bravery, is considered the beginning of the so-called Northern Wars. The sack of Cintra's capital has been dubbed the Slaughter of Cintra -- and rightly so, for not even children were spared by Emhyr's soldiers. The heroic deaths of the city's defenders, and in particular queen Calanthe's, the Lioness of Cintra, have been lauded in many songs and tales. And so until very recently the rallying cry of the Northern Realms' armies was "Remember Cintra!"
   1068509|00000000||<i>Ain't a stall without at least a Mahakaman awl</i><br>--Temerian saying<br><br>Dwarves have lived under the Mahakam mountain range, lying between Temeria and Aedirn and Lyria since time immemorial. They are known all around the world for their excellent workshops, smithies and foundries, which produce highest quality steel -- and weapons. <br><br>Mahakam dwarves are technically subordinate to kings of Temeria, but in fact are all but independent from the human rule. They answer only to one of their own, the Elder. Today, this title is borne by one Brouver Hogg, a wizened old dwarf known for his obsession with the traditions of yore. During the wars with Nilfgaard and the following conflicts, Mahakam dwarves supplied the Northern Realms with arms and even put up their own voluntary contingent, which fought valiantly during the famous battle of Brenna.
   1068510|00000000||<i>Velen? Been there once, once only. Got lost, rode down the wrong path, me cart got stuck in the marshes. So I went to the nearby village, askin' for help... Shite, that was really dumb of me.</i><br>--Norbert Angler, traveling merchant<br><br>Even during the times of peace, when Velen hasn't been swarming with bandits and deserters yet, I used to stay well clear of this cursed place. For some unfathomable reason , I always found sparsely populated marshlands, dirt-poor villages and boorish yokels repellent. Even Zoltan, admittedly less refined than myself, always said that Velen is nothing but "barrens, bushes and chorts."<br><br>Now that Velen has been ravaged by wars, its bogs and swamps became true feasting grounds for all sorts of necrophages and other carrion eating monsters. It comes as little surprise, then, that no one, with the possible exception of job-seeking witchers, ventures there anymore.
   1068511|00000000||<i>Calm down, good sir, 'cause if you keep on sputterin' like that, you're goin' to soil yer esteemed spouse's dress. Sure, the wine's expensive. As it should be, given it came straight from the Toussain' vineyards!</i><br>--Angelique Duvin, merchant from Novigrad <br><br>Toussaint, and it's breathtaking capital, Beauclair, are beyond doubt among the most charming corners of the earth. The inhabitants of this blessed land, starting with its ruler, duchess Anna Henrietta -- a distant relative of Emhyr var Emreis's, by the way -- all the way down to the simple peasants, live their lives as if they were a never-ending ball. Each day starts and ends with wine, songs and romance, each day is marked by some sort of a holiday, feast or other festivity, one more sumptuous than the other. <br><br>The Duchy of Toussaint does not possess a regular army -- it's borders are protected by knights-errant, known for the peculiar oaths they swear by when joining the ranks of this unusual brotherhood. Add the fact that Toussaint is a world-famous wine producer and exporter, and the image you'll get is a happy, if also somewhat tipsy little statelet, ever celebrating -- and out of touch with reality.
   1068512|00000000||<i>If you're going to lie to me, Frans, at least show some imagination. Dog ate your homework? Why not a dragon, who flew here all the way from Zerrikania, desperate to find out what you had to say about the political system in Brugge?</i><br>--Marabella, teacher from Novigrad<br><br>This exotic, semi-legendary land lies far, far away to the North-East, beyond the Blue Mountains. Very little is known about it, for few people have traveled there, and even fewer managed to return. There are stories, though -- about incredible wild animals and terrifying monsters, including poisonous insects the size of an ox and of course dragons, which the Zerrikanians revere like gods. If even a few of these tales are true, then Zerrikania is a land as beautiful as it is dangerous. <br><br> Zerrikania is also known for rare spices, excellent bows and dangerous women -- warriors for hire, clad in lion furs and with tattooed faces, unmatched both on the battlefield and in the alcove. Armed with the curved <i>saberras</i>, which they use with deadly precision, Zerrikanian women earned a reputation of excellent but prohibitively expensive mercenaries.
   1068513|00000000||<i>I don't get it. Ruins like any other, really.</i><br>--Johnny from Mare Hill, Redanian army sergeant <br><br> The ancient city of Loc Muinne lies at the source of the Pontar river, right at the feet of the Blue Mountains. Its crumbling walls have been a mute witness of innumerable tragedies, a few of which I will briefly outline herein. Historians say that Loc Muinne has been built many centuries ago by the lizard-like race known as the Vrans. After their fall, the city has been taken over by the Aen Seidhe elves. Their rule over Loc Muinne has been put to an end by the infamous Redanian marshal Raupenneck of Tretogor, whose soldiers slaughtered all inhabitants of this ancient city, paying no heed to their victims' age or sex. After the massacre, the city was abandoned and has been slowly decaying ever since. <br><br>Loc Muinne has been painted red with blood yet again during the recent summit of the North's rulers and various other worthies. The many plots, provocations, murders and even an attack of a dragon have been overshadowed by other dramatic events, that is, exposing the treacherous conspiracy of the Lodge of the Sorceress, Radovid's rise to dominate the North and the political triumph of the Nilfgaardian Empire, which managed to sow the seed of discord between the rulers of the North and thus cleared the decks for the coming invasion.
   1068514|00000000||<i>This is supposed to be Alzur's Double Cross? More like Moron's Single Rhomboid. Sit down, F.</i><br>--Margarita Laux-Antille, chancellor of the Aretuza School of Sorceresses<br><br>Until very recently, the city of Aretuza, situated on a little islet of Thanedd off the coasts of Temeria, was famous for its School of Sorceresses. Becoming one of its students was considered a great honor -- and meant paying an even greater fee. The quality of the education, however, justified the expenses. The alumnae of this venerable institution were immensely respected and were sure to land great jobs immediately after graduating.<br><br>Among the School's chancellors were many famous sorceresses, including the grand mistress Tissaia de Vries and Margarita Laux-Antille. Among the famous alumnae, on the other hand, one should mention one Triss Merigold and a certain Yennefer of Vengerberg.<br><br>Unfortunately, the School has suffered greatly during the so-called Thanedd Coup, when the North's magicians jumped at each other's throats. And since it never rains, but pours, just a few years later, when mages' persecutions started, the School was closed down for good.
   1068517|00000000||<i>Soaring spires, tall as yews... Houses of white marble... And a sky upon which twin suns burned...</i><br>--Statement by Lidke var Mwahar, a Nilfgaardian reputedly captured by the Wild Hunt. Classified material.<br><br>The city of Tir na Lia was said to be the capital of the Aen Elle elves and the seat of their king, Auberon Muircetach. Few people had the opportunity to see it, with the possible exception of those who have been captured by the Wild Hunt and taken to their realm. From among those I know, only Ciri has been there for some time, but she never wanted to talk much about it. I have heard from other sources, however, that Tir na Lia is a city of great beauty, and its sight alone fills one's heart with great admiration, but also longing and unspeakable grief.
   1068518|00000000||<i>What is magic? I can show you... If you're not afraid, that is. </i><br>--Keira Metz, sorceress<br><br>There are many learned definitions of this term. I am myself partial to the uncharacteristically poetic one offered by my friend Ciri, who said that magic is Art, Chaos and Science combined. For art is indeed both artistry and curse, threat and progress. It all depends on who wields it and what purposes it is made to serve. <br><br>Magic is sometimes also called Power. Mages claim they draw it from Nature itself, or, to be more precise, from the Four Elements of which it comprises. They say it slumbers in the earth below us, in the fire which purportedly burns in its core, the air we breathe and water we drink. Drawing upon its Power its the very basis of mages' education, for mastering it allows them to achieve things beyond the wildest dreams of regular mortals.
   1068519|00000000||<i>For nigh is the Time of the Sword and Axe, the Age of the Wolven Blizzard. Nigh is the Time of the White Frost and White Light, the Time of Madness and Disdain, Tedd Deireádh - the Final Age. The world shall perish amidst ice and be reborn with the new sun.</i><br>--Ithlinne's Prophecy<br><br>Priests, scholars and sorcerers all have different definitions of the White Frost and conflicting theories as to where it is to come from. Some speak of a natural cooling of the climate, likely happen in three thousand years or so, bringing utter destruction, reducing civilization to ruin and pushing the whole of humanity back toward and age of barbarism.<br><br>Yet others think the White Frost a more esoteric and mysterious evil, one that will shatter not just our world, but many other worlds, too. Whatever the case, if there is but a grain of truth in Ithlinne's Prophecy, acquiring woolen hose, a sheepskin jacket and a fur hat may not suffice to weather the coming storm.
   1068522|00000000||<i>Holy blood, cursed blood! Blood of the murderess and blood of the saviors! Blood of the birth, blood of the death!</i><br>--Fragment of a prophecy<br><br>Hen Ichaer, the mysterious Elder Blood, can be traced back to the elven Sage Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal -- who, even though she was meant to marry another, fell in love with a human mage, one Cregennan of Lod. And even though the two lovers died horrible deaths, their line survived. There are many legends regarding Lara's offspring -- some entirely wrong, some containing a grain of truth. <br><br>According to some prophecies, the Avenger will be born of the Elder Blood, one who will drown the whole world in blood and will build a new one on its ruins. Other revelations, however, claim that Hen Ichaer will be our only protection from the White Frost. According to the famous elven seer Ithlinne, it is from Elder Blood that the mysterious Zireael will emerge -- the Swallow, bringer of spring and rebirth.
   1068523|00000000||<i>What's the difference between a Sage and a sorcerer? Same as between a campfire and a volcano, dear.</i><br>--Millegarda of Redania, lecturer at the Aretuza School of Sorceresses<br><br>The term "Sage" is a rather loose translation of the elven expression "Aen Saevherne". Humans often think it's a synonym for the word "sorcerer" -- but they are gravely mistaken. The enigmatic Aen Saevherne do of course use Power, and with great proficiency, but at the same time possess an impressive knowledge regarding not just magic, but also medicine, art and -- as I was told -- other worlds, dimensions and time itself. <br><br> Even within the elven society, Sages form a separate, mysterious but also greatly respected caste. They follow their own moral code, the basic premise of which, it seems, is the well-being of their people.
   1068524|00000000||<i>Ragh nar Roog! Ragh nar Roog! Ragh naaaar Roooooog!!!</i><br>--Skellige battle cry<br><br>Skellige legends are as beautiful as they are gloomy. Islanders love stories about bloody vendettas, battles and heroes laughing at the face of danger. One myth masterfully combines all these elements -- the legend of Ragh nar Roog, the final battle between men and gods on one side and monsters, specters and demons from the land of Morhögg on the other. The outcome of this conflict is supposed to determine whether the world will be shrouded in eternal darkness or if the sun will rise yet again. <br><br>The battle will commence with the coming of Tedd Deidrach, the Time of End, Time of White Frost and Wolf's Blizzard. First will come the ghastly Naglfar, a longship built of the deceased's fingernails, carrying a crew of evil specters. Then, Kambi the Rooster will crow, waking the mythical hero Hemdall, and he in turn will sound his horn, giving a sign of the coming battle, in which the world's fate will be determined. <br><br>Skelligers treat this legend very seriously. This is why they cut their dead's fingernails short before burying them, hoping that this will slow down the construction of Naglfar and the world's end. On a side note, it's interesting that there are many overlapping points between this legend and the prophecies regarding the coming of the Time of End and White Frost, which one can hear on the continent.

For example, I can use it to ask one of my esteemed colleagues for advice regarding a particularly complex spell -- or ask if the new dress makes me look fat. </i><br>--Fringilla Vigo, sorceress<br><br>Since I'm an honest and humble fellow, I readily admit that I know little about how megascopes -- that is, sophisticated communication devices use by mages -- really work. <br><br>What I do know is that, unlike the famous crystal orbs, which can be used only to communicate with one other, synced orb, megascopes have a wide array of  functions. Mages can use them not only to talk to each other, but also to spy on others, conduct magical searches, observations and gods know what else.

Unless I show you my scars…</i><br>A story about higher vampires overheard in a tavern along the high road to Scala<br><br>As Geralt once explained to me, this term is oft erroneously applied as a catch-all for a number of more powerful varieties of vampire, including bruxae, alps and katakans. Said species do indeed exhibit some singular characteristics not observed in their "lesser" cousins, whence the tendency to describe them as "higher" vampires. Yet in spite of peculiarities like their resistance to sunlight, ability to assume human form, or certain telepathic skills, they are not, in fact, higher vampires <i>per se</i>.<br><br>For higher vampires are a distinct and unusual variety of beasts. Their powers are extreme and often unique to single specimens. They also possess personalities, desires and motivations, and thus are in no way driven solely to hunt in order to satisfy their thirst for blood. They can live for years among ordinary folk without ever betraying their true nature. Incredibly quick and partially resistant to fire (though great heat can do them harm), they are foes even witchers need fear.

Orens are worth as much as bean husks now!</i><br>--Heinrich Zucker, merchant from Ellander<br><br>The war between Nilfgaard and the Northern Realms has not only caused many borders to shift, but has also turned the entire Continent's economy upside-down. Currencies, in particular, have been greatly affected by the political upheaval.<br><br>The surest coin is the crown minted in Novigrad. Thanks to the free city's vibrant economy, its currency is highly valued and is the only means of payment accepted around the world, by the North's merchants, nobles, townsfolk and simple peasants, as well as by Nilfgaardian quartermasters, dwarven bankers, women plying the world's oldest trade and, last but not least, by witchers.<br><br>The value of the Nilfgaardian floren depends on the state of the empire's economy rather than on the coin's gold content. The initial success of the empire's military campaign greatly boosted the currency's worth, but months later, as the conflict lagged on, it began to take its toll, and the coin's value is now dropping slowly but surely. Still, Nilfgaardian florens can be exchanged for crowns at most banks and shops. <br><br>The Temerian oren, bearing the aquiline profile of the now-deceased King Foltest, is, like Temeria itself, one of the least fortunate victims of the war. The value of the currency of this battered, occupied country holds stable, but at a very low level, reflecting the coin's silver content. Still, my good friend Vimme Vivaldi, Novigrad's foremost banker, advises all to get rid of the Temerian currency at their earliest convenience, just in case.
   1077128|00000000||<i>Mole-hill this big? Interesting...</i><br>--Last words uttered by Vaclav of Ostrava, royal gardener<br><br>Before I met Geralt, the word "nest" had very pleasant connotations -- for it made me think of songbirds, such as jays or nightingales, and is a part of "love nest", an expression which brings back the best of memories.<br><br> The witcher made me realize, however, that it's not just harmless birdies who build nests -- but also dangerous monsters, such as nekkers or phoocas. Geralt said one should destroy their nests using bombs, such as Grapeshots or Dancing Stars -- a rather useless piece of advice, however, given that I haven't touched explosive materials since my first year at the Oxenfurt Academy, when, by pure accident of course, I have blown up the School of Alchemy.
   1078206|00000000||<i>Whatever your heart's desire, you're likely to find it in Novigrad. Zerrikanian spices? As many as you please. Gwyhyrs hammered out in ancient gnomish smithies? Not a problem, two for the price of one. Wine from Toussaint? All vintages you may desire at your beck and call - if you have the coin, that is. Lots of it.</i><br>--Patricia Engelkind, Novigrad townswoman<br><br>Novigrad is often referred to as the world's capital - and not without reason. Its immense wealth, influence and strategic importance make it a power unto itself, a power even the kings of the North as well as the emperor must respect. For whoever controls the Free City with its vast treasury, numerous manufactories and workshops and, last but not least, sizable fleet, holds the key to the Northern Realms. <br><br>Unfortunately, in recent times the freedom which Novigradians claim to value so highly has given way to anarchy. The Church of the Eternal Fire persecutes mages and nonhumans, while bandits, until recently constrained by the unwritten criminal code, jump at each others' throats and foreign spies scramble to gain influence over the city's councilors and priests. The air of Novigrad is now thick with smoke bellowing from the omnipresent pyres, and its cobblestones have turned slippery with blood.
   1078207|00000000||<i>Dandelion? Sure I remember him! He was banned from coming less than one hundred feet of the School of Alchemy... And less than three hundred feet of the girls' dormitory.</i><br>--Lincoln Worcester, key keeper at the Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Oxenfurt is world famous for its university, my <i>Alma Mater</i> -- Oxenfurt Academy. Having spent many years there, I think of Oxenfurt with great sentiment. Once, this city resounded with the buzz of voices, songs of tipsy students and shouting merchants, whose stalls were weighing down under innumerable exotic articles from all over the world. Professors spent their days on academic discussions, students sat through hours of lectures and drank through many pints of ale afterwards -- for alcohol, as it is widely known, greatly lubricates the difficult process of absorbing knowledge. <br><br> However, this cradle of science, art and unconstrained thinking has become the thorn in the side of the enemies of tolerance and freedom. After Radovid's rise to power, privileges of the university -- which, in theory at least, was both apolitical and exterritorial -- were successively restricted and eventually cancelled. Protesting lecturers were fired and, if they persisted, thrown in jail, and a few were even beheaded. As for the Academy itself, it has been closed down until further notice. And so despotism, pride and insanity have triumphed over culture, love of truth and wisdom -- at least for some time.
   1078309|00000000||<i>Aye, master, "squirrels," you got it right. That's what they be callin' themselves in the Ol' Speech. Some say it's 'cause they strap squirrel tails to their hats. Yet others claim it's on account that they live in the woods and stay alive on nuts... </i><br>--Overheard on the road<br><br>"Scoia'tael" is an umbrella term for all nonhuman guerillas fighting against human rule. Their units, ranging in size from a handful to a few dozen fighters, consist mostly of elves and dwarves, with just a few halflings and gnomes who decided to take up arms after years of putting up with discrimination and persecution. In spite of their lofty, even noble goals, Scoia'tael are known for the unsurpassed cruelty with which they treat human soldiers and civilians alike. <br><br>The first Scoia'tael units were formed during the First War with Nilfgaard, but continued their fight even after the truce with the empire was signed. They set ambushes along on forest tracks, attacked isolated villages and lone travelers. After the Second War with Nilfgaard and the subsequent founding of Dol Blathanna, the elves' own state, many Scoia'tael laid down their arms. Yet the fiercest insurgents carried on, fighting not for freedom, but to satisfy personal vendettas. The memory of Scoia'tael cruelty remains very much alive among humans, and parents still use the names of legendary rebel commanders like Isengrim Faoiltiarna or Iorveth to scare naughty babes.
   1078311|00000000||<i>Three drops of quicksilver... Two pinches of saltpeter... A cup of aqua regia and an ounce of-- Shite! Run for your lives!</i><br>--Petrus Bonus, alchemist, known as Pete Three Fingers<br><br>Alchemy is an art of concocting various magical substances. It is particularly important for those plying the trade of a witcher, as it allows creating special potions, bombs and oils, which, when applied to the sword's blade, greatly enhance the damage dealt against specific opponents. <br><br>Alchemy requires harvesting extremely rare or even unique ingredients, extensive knowledge of secret formulas and a lot of patience. As it was often remarked by my lecturer of Alchemy at the Oxenfurt Academy, "the ancient and respected art of Alchemy unveils its mysteries only to the select few who will persist in striving for knowledge and truth, against all odds."<br><br>This might very well be true, but I quickly came to the conclusion that mastering this art, even if it lead to discovering Philosopher's Stone itself, is not worth spending hours upon hours stooping over retors, alembics and measuring cylinders. Nevertheless, I have great respect for this discipline, for it is thanks to alchemy that the process of distillation, the very basis of brewing spirits, has been discovered.
   1078312|00000000||<i>What humans are, you can see for yourself</i><br>--Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, vol. III<br><br>Since humans landed at the mouth of the Yaruga river five hundred years ago, they have brought most of the known world under their control. Conquering the lands of the Aen Seidhe elves, pushing dwarves back to their lair under the mountains of Mahakam, or near-extermination of the Vrans and werebbubbs are all a grim, but indisputable sign of our race's supremation. <br><br>Unlike the other races, humans are not particularly long-lived, but they do possess other advantages, such as high fertility or adaptive skills -- which they have used to appropriate other civilizations' elements of culture, art, science, magic, art of war, medicine and even dress.<br><br> Our chief weakness, on the other hand, is undoubtedly the utter inability to cooperate and cohabitate with others -- which puts us so starkly apart from the halflings, dwarves, gnomes and even elves. Many scholars believe that internecine wars, which have been the curse of humanity since the very beginnings of history, will also be the reason behind its eventual collapse.
   1078316|00000000||<i>We took many useful things from the elves... and gave precious little in return.</i><br>--Triss Merigold<br><br>The Aen Seidhe elves are but a shadow of their former selves. Centuries ago, they ruled almost the entire Continent, boasting a refined culture, sophisticated art and advanced science. The arrival of humans quickly put an end to this golden age - in one bloody war after another, the Aen Seidhe were defeated and decimated, their cities and gardens razed and turned to ruins. The survivors were either driven off into the wilderness of the Blue Mountains or forced to live humiliating lives in ghettos, facing never-ending chicanery and persecution. It comes as no surprise, then, that many took up arms again and joined the ranks of the Scoia'tael rebels, swearing to push humans back into the sea. <br><br>Elves are extremely long-lived - the passing years are but the blink of an eye to them. What also sets them apart from us is a very narrow window during which they can procreate, and, as a natural consequence, their very low fertility. The Aen Seidhe believe this to be the main reason for their decline. As one of my elven friends put it, "Even though we fought like wolves, we lost to a race which fucks like rabbits."
   1078318|00000000||<i>When confronted with things they do not comprehend, dh'oine often say they are "out of this world." Most of the time this is yet another sign of their ignorance. But sometimes they're right.</i><br>–Francesca Findabair, elven mage, ruler of Dol Blathanna<br><br>It may seem incredible, but I swear it's true – our world is not the only one there is. Somewhere out there, separated from us by both time and space, exist many other universes. They are home to many, mostly hostile creatures, some of which have come unto this world during the cataclysm known as the Conjunction of the Spheres.<br><br>The existence of such worlds is postulated by mages, some scholars and a few priests. Their hypotheses are corroborated by elven legends, according to which the Aen Seidhe have once possessed the ability to travel between the dimensions. They purportedly did so using magical portals placed inside the famous elven towers, the ruins of which are still to be seen in some isolated parts of the world.
   1078323|00000000||<i>Either I'm goin' crazy, or this bloody powder-box is talkin' to me!</i><br>--Klaus Bober, fisherman from Tarn Mira, finder of Rience's xenovox <br><br>Xenovox is a relatively simple magical instrument, which usually looks like a little box, casket or richly adorned snuff-box. It is used to communicate over long distances -- however, unlike the megascope, which projects an image of the speaker, xenovox carries only his or her voice. <br><br>How this contraption might work, I haven't the foggiest idea. Once, driven by curiosity, I took apart a xenovox which belonged to a good friend of mine. Contrary to popular belief, inside I did not find sirens' lips or a gnome with a speaking trumpet, but only dozens of little springs, screws and cogs gleaming with magic --which I was utterly unable to put back together.
   1078324|00000000||<i>"Valley of Flowers"... That's rich. More like a valley of traitors, murderers and ploughin' whores.</i><br>--Henselt, king of Kaedwen <br><br>These days, Dol Blathanna is the only elven state in existence. It lies at the eastern fringe of Aedirn, at the feet of the Blue Mountains. It has been created pursuant to the Cintra Treaty -- which ended the last war with Nilfgaard -- on the strength of a clause added on Emhyr var Emreis's demand. The Aen Seidhe elves have paid dearly for the emperor's support -- in order to gain it, they first had to support his armies by engaging  the Northern Realms' soldiers in bloody guerilla warfare. <br><br> When the human settlers of Dol Blathanna learned that they have to abandon their houses and return the valley to its original inhabitants, they reduced it to ashes and rubble in pure frustration and anger. Demavend, then king of Aedirn, to whom this sliver of land belonged at the time, not only did nothing to stop his subjects, but even aided them in destruction, sending over his solders dressed in civilian clothes to cut down the forests, poison the lakes and kill off the valley's wild animals. <br><br>Elves took over the ruined valley without uttering a single word of complaint. In just a few years, Francesca Findabair, the valley's ruler, and her right hand, the Sage by the name of Ida Emean, managed to return Dol Blathanna to its former glory. The valley's fields, fertilized with ashes, yielded record crops, and new palaces quickly replaced the ruins. Elves have reclaimed a bit of the world they once controlled -- but soon they might have to fight its defense, for Nordlings now hate and resent Aen Seidhe more than ever.
   1078325|00000000||<i>Ne t'aervenne comm Nordling! [Don't you behave like a Nordling!]</i><br>--Nilfgaardian expression<br><br>"Nordling" is an all-encompassing term for the inhabitants of the Northern Realms, used mostly by Nilfgaardians and, more rarely, by the folk of Skellige. It is most often used as an epithet implying laziness, treachery, barbarity and excessive lust. As much as I would like to contend we do not deserve such a damning reputation, I generally strive not to lie.
   1068431|00000000||<i>Laura? As soon as she figured out the hunters were after 'er, she jumped out the window. Preferred to break her neck than wind up in their 'ands. </i><br>--Overheard in the Putrid Grove<br><br>Soon after the North's once-respected mages began to face persecution very similar in kind to the religious, a new profession was born - that of witch hunter. These self-righteous brutes may issue from different backgrounds, professions and social strata, but they have one goal which unites them all - to track down and kill any and all suspected of dabbling in magic. <br><br> Some witch hunters are religious fanatics, others are calculating opportunists who concluded that pursuing mages would be an easy way to get rich and secure an elevated station in the "new, better order" promised by their benefactor, King Radovid of Redania.

Still, I prefer them to dh'oine.</i><br>– Yaevinn, legendary Scoia'tael commander<br><br>Sylvans and yakshas, a kindred species, are extremely rare woodland creatures whose appearance combines traits of goats and rotund men. These beings usually pose little danger, for they limit their contact with humans to playing harmless (though often bothersome) tricks and eating crops from their fields.<br>
   1077931|00000000||Sylvans and yakshas resemble men not just in appearance but also in behavior – though it must be said they have adopted more of our vices and weaknesses than strengths. Lazy by nature, they would gladly spend every day in idleness, puffing on pipes, gorging on rich foods and downing strong drinks. <br><br>Since sylvans and yakshas enjoy partaking of the fruits of others' labors without asking permission, men do not take to them kindly and at times, fooled by their awkward appearance, will try to solve this problem using force. This often ends in tragedy, for sylvans, despite their corpulent frames, are astonishingly strong and agile. They also emit a powerful and extremely unpleasant scent which can cause even a witcher, whose line of work accustoms him to foul stenches, to gag and feel faint. Watch out in particular for yakshas, which are fiercer and keener on fighting than normal sylvan.

Third and last: that it shall show no mercy.

   1077673|00000000||<i>Men, the polite ones, at least, would call me a monster. A blood-drinking freak.</i><br>– Emiel Regis, higher vampire <br><br>Only a mutual thirst for blood links higher vampires to their distant and much more primitive cousins: ekimmaras, alps, katakans and the like. Higher vampires are, in fact, much more similar to humans than to those bat-like blood slurpers. They not only resemble us in appearance, but also share our intelligence and behavioral patterns. This means they do not squat in distant forests or hide in the shadows. On the contrary, they are particularly fond of cities, where they live out deceivingly normal lives. Even witchers are not capable of recognizing them at once, for their medallions remain perfectly motionless in the presence of higher vampires. Yet all these similarities should not blind us to an essential difference: unlike men, higher vampires are immortal. Those who have faced them in combat and survived can be counted on one hand.<br>
   1077674|00000000||It is a witcher's good fortune that higher vampires are extremely rare – and not all are dangerous to humans. Though they do have a taste for blood, they do not need to drink it to survive. Some higher vampires have renounced feeding on humans altogether and do no harm to anyone, but others give in to their desires. A witcher who braves fighting a higher vampire must bear in mind that he faces a monster endowed with incredible strength, one able to manipulate men and animals, turn invisible and transform into a giant bat - and furthermore one which it is nearly impossible to kill. In other words, even an experienced monster slayer should think twice before accepting a contract on one of these creatures, even if half a kingdom and a princess' hand is in the offing.

   1053206|00000000||Some gossiping students informed Geralt about the annual intramural regatta organized by the Oxenfurt Academy. Though the campus had been closed as a result of war-related politics, the students had decided to keep with tradition and put on their own regatta. Geralt was interested in taking part, but as it was a students-only event, first he had to matriculate. Thus, in an admirable step towards increasing the diversity of its student body, the illustrious Oxenfurt Academy admitted the witcher Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1053207|00000000||The winds were in the witcher's favor! He won the regatta and collected the grand prize.

   1048622|00000000||After a long search Geralt was at last a step from his goal. Avallac'h had hid Ciri from the Hunt on the magical Isle of Mists, which could only be reached if fate deemed one worthy - or by following a magic firefly, which was decidedly the easier option. Geralt thus readied himself to sail to the isle and bring back Ciri.<br>
   1048623|00000000||Finally. After years of separation, weeks of searching, dozens of false trails and endless worry, Geralt had found Ciri. They were not given long to celebrate their reunion, however. As soon as Ciri awoke from her magic slumber the Wild Hunt picked up her trail and began to attack. Geralt and his adopted daughter thus had no choice but to use Ciri's special abilities to flee to Kaer Morhen and face their attackers there.<br>

   1061860|00000000||I always considered it a point of particular pride to count Triss Merigold of Maribor among my closest and dearest friends. This exceptionally talented sorceress was a shining star of her profession, the former mage advisor to King Foltest, and a famous hero of the Battle of Sodden, known as the Fourteenth of the Hill. Yet in no way did she resemble her often unbearably haughty sisters in magic. Her deft mind, warm smile and considerable personal charm had always won over even the hardest of hearts.<br><br>Though my personal relations with Triss never ventured beyond the fraternal, Geralt of Rivia at one point found her allure irresistible. From then on the two shared feelings that ran far deeper than a superficial and fleeting fancy.<br>
   1061861|00000000||Yennefer told Geralt that Triss had recently taken up residence in the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061862|00000000||It seemed Triss had gone into hiding from the so-called witch hunters persecuting magic wielders in the city, turning to one of the leaders of the local underworld for protection.<br>
   1061863|00000000||After a bit of a run-around Geralt found the sorceress, who had indeed entered into an arrangement with the so-called King of Beggars. She paid for his protection by providing magic services to his organization. Though Triss did not know anything about Ciri and her stay in Novigrad, she promised to do all within her power to aid Geralt's search.<br>
   1061866|00000000||Though theoretically Triss and Geralt had ended their romance half a year earlier, it was clear the feelings they felt for each other had not vanished so easily. To deal with this, the sorceress pretended that nothing had happened and the witcher, as is his wont, sheepishly masked his feelings with a mix of hesitant interest and fake indifference. It must be said that both of them handled the situation quite awkwardly.<br>
   1061873|00000000||The plan to get close to Caleb Menge that Triss presented to the witcher was very risky and placed her in great danger. The sorceress knew, however, that Ciri's life might be on the line, and so did not hesitate for even a moment.<br>
   1061876|00000000||The sorceress' laugh, the look in her cornflower blue eyes, the memory of enchanting moments spent together - all that surely weighed on Geralt's decision to kiss Triss in the Vegelbuds' garden. And though their moment of sweet oblivion lasted briefly, it breathed a gale's worth of new life into the feelings between them.<br>
   1061877|00000000||Triss and Geralt had been through thick and thin together, but on that fateful day, on the wind-swept Novigrad docks, they bid their final farewells. She sailed off for Kovir, while he stayed and choked on the smoke wafting off the pyres of Novigrad.<br>
   1061879|00000000||Yet Geralt and Triss in fact met again, at Kaer Morhen. Triss had come on Yennefer's request to help defend Ciri, whom she had always treated as a younger sister.<br>
   1061880|00000000||Though Triss and Geralt said their final goodbyes on that wind-swept Novigrad dock, in the end the sorceress decided not to leave for Kovir after all. She knew that when Geralt asked her to stay, the witcher was opening up his heart to her for the first time.<br>
   1061883|00000000||Geralt and Triss met again at Kaer Morhen. Triss arrived there at the witcher's behest to help defend Ciri, whom she had always treated as a younger sister.<br>
   1061884|00000000||Not for the first time Geralt showed what a babe in the wilderness he was in matters involving the fairer sex. For while I can say from experience that there are indeed women who will willingly share a man with their best friend, when trying that with women to whom one has declared true and undying love, things tend to turn out differently.<br><br>Toying with Triss' feelings ended in humiliation for Geralt - a fate which, I must admit, he thoroughly deserved.<br>

   1077619|00000000||<i>Friend of mine used to say that with all these griffins and basilisks and whatnot, good old fashioned wolves weren't nothing to worry about… Then the damned beasts devoured half his flock.</i><br>– Yngvar, shepherd<br><br>Once upon a time wolves were the absolute rulers of the forest. Men used them to frighten children, while adults, too, trembled at the sound of their howling. Post-Conjunction monsters not only pushed wolves into the deepest wilds but also took over their place in human nightmares. Yet this does not mean the old predators ceased to be a danger. Wolves do not have a drop of magic within them, breathe no fire and spit no acid, but that in no way stops them from killing unwary travelers and hunters.<br><br>Particularly dangerous are wargs, a nasty and ferocious subspecies of wolf, and the snow-white wolves which today can only be found in the wild highlands of the Skellige archipelago.<br>
   1077620|00000000||Wolves usually feed in packs counting from a handful to over a dozen members, though some particularly strong males hunt alone. Though wolves are weaker than many post-Conjunction monsters, they make up for any lack of strength with their intelligence. When fighting them one must be especially careful not to become surrounded. The presence of wolves can also signal more serious trouble – these predators often share their hunting grounds with werewolves and leshens.

   1086968|00000000||<br>To bait the vampire, Geralt took note of its dietary preferences and seasoned his blood to match by loading up on cheap wine. This made it somewhat harder to aim his blows, true, but he still managed to defeat the beast - then had another battle awaiting him the next morning, this one against a powerful hangover.
   1087325|00000000||<i>Vampire bites... and the strong stench of alcohol.</i><br>– Geralt of Rivia<br>
   1081904|00000000||Contrary to popular belief, monsters are not all alike. Like people, individual members of the same species can each have their own unique traits, preferences and weaknesses. A good example of this is the katakan which once fed on the inhabitants of Oxenfurt. Perhaps influenced by its close proximity to the hard-drinking student youth of the city, this vampire had developed a keen appetite for blood spiked with a hefty dose of hard alcohol - and also baubles and gaudy jewelry of all kinds.<br><br>The vampire had clearly thrived on its high-octane diet. It had grown exceptionally strong and gained the ability to regenerate lost life quickly, cause heavy bleeding with its claws and, if all that were not enough, meld into the air and appear again behind its opponent's back. Luckily the Quen Sign meant the witcher was well-equipped to defend against this surprise attack, and the Yrden Sign would let him catch the monster in a trap.

Then sail to Undvik, climb the mountain and walk the ridge. Bow once to each of the four winds, commend yourself to the gods and toss the chest into the sea."<br><br>Holvarg did as the druid counseled, then returned to the Sacred Grove. "I tossed the chest in the sea," Holvarg said. "But I don't feel one bit wiser." The druid replied, "That is because there are no shortcuts on the road to wisdom. Neither saying prayers nor making offerings nor listening to the words of wise men will grant it to you. That is your lesson.” Hearing this, Holvarg flew into a rage and strangled the druid with his bare hands, then stuck his head on a pike and set it out in front of his house, so everyone would know that, while he might not be wise, he was nobody's fool.<br>

   1051076|00000000||While traversing the fields near Midcopse, Geralt came across some strange tracks. He would not be a witcher if he did not look into such a matter.<br>
   1051078|00000000||Geralt discovered that the monster the locals called Jenny o' the Woods was in fact a common nightwraith. This unfortunate being had been born of a woman murdered by her rejected lover.

   1054850|00000000||Geralt drove off the nightwraith that the unfortunate Zula had become. I derive some small pleasure in knowing that a person to whom life had been so cruel found at least this measure of relief after death...<br>
   1058328|00000000||While in the area around the village of Midcopse, Geralt decided to look around and see if there wasn't anyone in need of a witcher.

Geralt decided this was something he should look into.<br>

   1048576|00000000||Continuing his tour of rural Velen, Geralt stopped by the village of Lindenvale. There he came across a grief-stricken old woman. The cause of her woe? She was homeless, a monster having made its nest in her family manor and forced her into a rental situation elsewhere that had recently proven unaffordable. When Geralt approached her, she asked him to rid her manor of this beast. In return she gave him a precious token - the key to the chest in which she claimed to keep her life savings. Geralt couldn't refuse to help an elderly person in need, especially not one so eager to reward him handsomely for it, and so decided to do as she asked.<br>
   1048577|00000000||Geralt rid the Reardon family manor of its monstrous dangers. When Dolores heard the news she was beside herself with joy, as the place was closely tied to her fondest childhood memories - to the days when she was young and beautiful and lived there with her brother and parents.

   1074513|00000000||When Geralt arrived at the Reardon family manor, he found that Letho had long ago rid the place of the beasts that once prowled it. All that was left for him to do was to tell the woman that her former home was now safe. When Dolores heard the news she was beside herself with joy, as the place was closely tied to her fondest childhood memories - to the days when she was young and beautiful and lived there with her brother and parents.<br>
   1048578|00000000||Speaking of that brother... while in the manor, Geralt happened across a most unusual find - the body of a young man bricked up behind a wall. It seemed this was no macabre bricklaying accident but a grisly murder - the man was Humbert, Dolores' brother, and his murderer Dolores' first husband, Roderick. He returned to Dolores and told her this, and, though learning the truth froze the old woman's blood in her veins and undoubtedly took years off the already short time remaining to her, she was grateful to Geralt for the information.<br>

   1001947|00000000||Concern filled Crach's voice. And something else… pride? The jarl had pulled Geralt aside during King Bran's wake to confess his worries about his daughter, Cerys. She had sailed to Spikeroog, seeking to cure Jarl Udalryk's mysterious affliction. A dangerous mission, though one that would certainly be less so with a witcher's help. Geralt eyed his old friend over carefully, then made his decision.<br>
   1001948|00000000||Geralt sailed to Spikeroog to help Cerys. Any doubts about whether this help would be needed were dispelled immediately: he found her lying unconscious in Udalryk's former home, now an abandoned ruin possessed by a mysterious force. When she regained her senses, she told Geralt her suspicions regarding Udalryk. The jarl did not commune with the gods, as many believed. Instead, a ghost tormented him, whispering destructive thoughts in his ear. A ghost -- if true, she would definitely need a witcher's aid. Geralt decided to help.<br>
   1001949|00000000||After analyzing all the evidence, Geralt came to the conclusion that Udalryk was not haunted by a ghost, as Cerys had thought, nor was he insane or touched by the gods, as many Skelligers believed. The situation was far more grave: a particularly malicious wraith, known as a hym, had latched onto the jarl. Geralt and Cerys thus faced the challenge of finding a way to free Udalryk from this evil being's power.<br>
   1001950|00000000||In the end, Geralt decided against meddling in Udalryk's personal affairs and left Cerys, whom he knew to lack neither courage nor resourcefulness, to resolve the matter herself.<br>
   1001951|00000000||Cerys hit upon an idea. They would trick the hym. Geralt decided to trust her. Cerys ran off, snatched Udalryk's infant child from its cradle and ran back towards the abandoned home, with the jarl and his honor guard hot on her heels. Meanwhile Hjort, whom Cerys had informed of her plan and asked for help, slipped into the house unnoticed.<br><br>Once inside, Cerys commanded Geralt to toss the babe into a burning stove. Caught off-guard by this seemingly-mad request, Geralt nevertheless acquiesced, hoping it was all part of the plan. To his great relief, it was. The hym, thinking Geralt an infanticide, left Udalryk to latch onto this new, even more guilt-ridden victim. Yet when it was revealed the child had survived unharmed, the evil being had to depart into the ether. Cerys' trickery and the witcher's cold blood had saved Udalryk, freeing him from his torment at long last.<br>
   1001952|00000000||Geralt decided to take care of the hym using tried and true witcher methods. This meant, as it often does, waiting until after dusk and gathering a generous supply of torches. Only then did he and Udalryk journey to the abandoned home to set about forcing the wraith to reveal its true visage. The fight lasted the entire night. Though at times Geralt feared Udalryk would not withstand the torture the hym dealt in its last throes of self-defense, by the time dawn came our heroes had triumphed and the hym had dissolved back into the ether.

   1050883|00000000||After a long search, Geralt had at last found Whoreson Junior and forced him to recount the truth of his dealings with Ciri - events in which I, dear reader, played a not insubstantial part.<br>
   1051245|00000000||Ciri and I had promised Whoreson a heap of treasure in return for his help. When we failed to deliver, he kidnapped our friend Dudu and started torturing him - his way of prodding us to improve our performance. But fear not, Dudu was not abandoned in his hour of need - Ciri broke into Junior's home, struck the rotten thug down and freed the doppler.<br><br>Alas, Junior then struck back with overwhelming force. Dudu could simply change form and melt into the crowd, but Ciri and I had to flee the city at breakneck speed, with Junior's strongmen on our heels the entire time. In the end we were driven to Temple Isle - and into a corner. Ciri was forced to use her abilities and teleported away. I struggled valiantly, but ultimately was captured by the Temple Guard and thrown into prison.

   1086972|00000000||<br>After a long fight, the witcher slew the archgriffin. Some scholars in nearby  Oxenfurt might accuse him of having contributed to the disappearance of an endangered species and disrupting the local ecosystem. Somehow, the witcher didn't seem likely to lose much sleep over the matter.

   1081892|00000000||Killers of various stripes - mercenaries, knights errant, ambitious lawmen - try at times to compete with witchers as monster slayers. This usually ends in a massacre that not only does not solve the problem, but in fact only makes it worse - the beast walks away from the fight unharmed, enraged and out for vengeance. Such was the case in the mountains outside Oxenfurt, where a powerful archgriffin had made its nest.<br><br>Once again it fell to the witcher to clean up after amateurs. He knew neither Igni nor bombs dealing fire damage would have any effect against this fire-loving creature. He would also have to look out for its acid, which can eat through even the thickest armor - leaving one vulnerable to its razor-sharp talons.

   1062457|00000000||Philippa Eilhart, one-time advisor to King Vizimir II, called the Just, member of the Council of Mages and later founder of the Lodge of Sorceresses, had played a momentous part in the history of the world as well as in Geralt's life.<br><br>There could be no denying her talent, yet neither could one claim she did not also at times demonstrate sickly ambition. Very trustworthy reports indicated she had had a hand in King Vizimir II's death, and, as a member of the Lodge, was implicated in the murder of two other monarchs as well - Demavend of Aedirn and Foltest of Temeria.<br><br>For this reason the one-time "Jewel of the Court at Tretogor" was now a wanted woman, the quarry of special forces from the North and Nilfgaard alike.<br>
   1062458|00000000||Vizimir's son and successor, Radovid V, was particularly eager to capture her. During their last encounter in Loc Muinne he had had Philippa's eyes gouged out, yet she had fled and he wanted nothing more than to stick the head of "Tretegor's Jewel" on a spike above the city gates.<br>
   1062459|00000000||Thanks to her mastery of the difficult art of polymorphy, Philippa had been able to evade her pursuers by transforming into an owl. Then she had holed up in a hideout outside Novigrad to wait out the worst.<br>
   1062461|00000000||Everything seemed to indicate that Philippa had not only been investigating magic cures to her lost vision, but had also taken concrete steps towards the reactivation of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Her current location, however, remained unknown.<br>
   1062462|00000000||Imagine our surprise when we learned Philippa had been right under our noses the whole time! During her flight from her pursuers she had sought shelter with an old lover and fellow mage. He must've still born a grudge, however, for he tricked her and imprisoned her in her owl form. After the witch hunters carted him off, his house was plundered and the owl wound up in the hands of… our dear friend Zoltan. Sadly Triss discovered this right after Zoltan had lost the owl in a game of cards - meaning our search had to continue.<br>
   1062463|00000000||Philippa's new "owner"? Dijkstra. Was it a coincidence that she was now in the hands of her spurned-ex-lover and hated enemy? Triss certainly didn't think so, instead suspecting the former spy had woven a gwent-centered web of subterfuge in order to settle some old scores.<br>
   1062464|00000000||Luckily for Philippa, Geralt got things under control and saved her from whatever delights Dijkstra was planning.<br>
   1062465|00000000||Though the Lodge's prior actions were highly controversial, Philippa stubbornly worked towards its reconstitution, offering Ciri the chance to join it as a full and equal member.<br>
   1072871|00000000||One can call historical justice the fact that Philippa Eilhart, Radovid's old tutor, ended the crazed monarch's life. In doing so she also exacted revenge for her blinding and the death and persecution of her fellow mages, so many of whom had died in agony on Radovid's orders.

   1002639|00000000||When Ciri and Geralt reached Hindarsfjall, Ciri mentioned she wished to visit someone very special to her, a young man named Skjall who had helped her flee the Wild Hunt. Yennefer and Geralt exchanged grim looks and gave Ciri the tragic news: Skjall was dead. Fighting back tears, Ciri announced she was going to visit his grave.<br>
   1002640|00000000||It turned out brave Skjall was not treated with the respect he deserved after his death. His body was thrown in a ditch like a rotting animal carcass. Offended to her very core, Ciri pulled his corpse out of the ditch and buried it with Geralt's help near the cemetery. This violation of custom aroused the disgust and outrage of nearby Skelligers, to whom Skjall was a disgraced outcast. Ciri remained intransigent and refused to give any ground to local sensibilities. All in all, it was an unfortunate incident that could have been handled more, hm... delicately.

   1059043|00000000||Graham was a simple fisherman from an even simpler village, Oreton, yet the role he had played in local events was anything but. Fyke Isle, the tower, the curse - he had been a key part of it all. Geralt had learned from Anabelle about the deep feelings the two had shared, but the rest of their tragic story only emerged later…<br>
   1059044|00000000||Exactly how the young man had participated in the incident in the tower remained rather unclear. What was certain was that he tried to defend his beloved and fled Fyke Isle right after what he thought was her death…<br>
   1059045|00000000||Stories about poor fishermen in love with their lord's daughters are not wont to end happily, but even the most tragic-quilled poet would find what Graham and Anabelle experienced excessively cruel. Their desire for happiness and mutual love was defeated by the cruelty of fate and the greed of men, damning the young couple to eternal suffering – Graham without his love at his side, Anabelle as a tortured soul wandering between the living and the dead.<br><br>There was nothing left to the witcher but to bring the young man Anabelle's earthly remains, hoping that a proper burial would bring peace to the girl's spirit and lift the curse.<br>
   1059046|00000000||Yet though the evil spell was indeed broken, this story still did not have a happy ending. A devious ghost of the plague was freed, and Graham became its first victim…<br>
   1059047|00000000||Graham filled Geralt in on the rest of the story, one in which youthful longing for happiness lost out to fate's cruelties and human greed. Having learned there was a slim chance he could save his beloved's ghost, the fisherman set out at once to help the witcher lift the curse weighing down on the isle.<br>
   1059048|00000000||Yet though the evil spell was indeed broken, this story still did not have a happy ending. Despite his courage and dedication, Graham died while saving the one he had never ceased to love.<br>

When he finally felt decrepitude taking a hold of him, he went into the woods to hunt a bear armed with only a knife - and thus ended his reign. It was remembered as an honorable and respected one, though some complained he preferred raiding to confronting the Isles' long-term problems, and that he let his wife's tongue wag too freely.

How's that not a good idea?</i><br>– Odess Thaka, traveler. Died tragically on Spikeroog<br><br>Cyclopses can easily be recognized by the single eye located in the center of their foreheads. If for some reason that is not visible, other tell-tale signs are their enormous size, incredible strength and a seething hatred for all humans.<br>
   1077862|00000000||Evidence suggests cyclopses can live for an incredibly long time. The one well-preserved specimen whom scholars have examined and documented – a body found in 1112 and taken to Oxenfurt specialists – was over three hundred years old at the time of its death. The remains of this specimen could until recently be seen in the Academy's zoological museum, but they were removed from display after students tried to dress the cyclops in a toga, damaging it significantly in the process.<br><br>As in the case of giants, one can only guess at the strong and weak points of a cyclops. Its heft alone precludes effective use of the Aard Sign, while its enormous physical strength would make its blows particularly deadly. Cyclopses are most likely vulnerable to ogroid oil. As monsters with relatively well-developed minds, they might also fall under the influence to the Axii Sign.

   1054252|00000000||In one of Skellige's famed arenas Geralt met an undefeated warrior named Jutta and decided to try his strength against her. Before he could do so, however, he had to complete several tasks to prove he was a worthy opponent.<br>
   1054253|00000000||Geralt did everything Jutta asked and in the end was granted the right to face her in combat. Though Geralt put up a brave fight, the warrior woman defeated him. Forced to savor the bitter taste of defeat, Geralt left the arena.<br>
   1054254|00000000||Geralt did everything Jutta asked and in the end was granted the right to face her in combat. Jutta proved a fierce and demanding opponent, but Geralt still was able to best her.

   1054255|00000000||Yet Geralt had no desire to get to know her any better and so thanked her for a fight well fought and continued on his way.<br>

   1059054|00000000||Geralt and I both knew Síle de Tansarville, the Recluse of Kovir, the once proud member of the Lodge of Sorceresses who in her day plotted, persuaded and spellcast the world into a shape of her liking. Síle always claimed she acted only out of concern for the good of magic and mankind, yet the blood of a great many people stained her hands, including that of kings who stood in the way of her aims. She took part in countless conspiracies and herself devised many intrigues in which the witcher often figured as an unwitting accomplice, obstacle or incidental victim.<br><br>Thus Geralt's prior meetings with the sorceress were stormy at best. On at least one occasion it could be said that Geralt saved Sile's life, but this did not mean he felt very warmly about her.<br><br>Be that as it may, the sight of the tortured and maimed sorceress in King Radovid's dungeon made the witcher's cold heart swell with sorrow and sympathy.
   1059056|00000000||Perhaps it was these feelings, or perhaps it was simply respect for a defeated former enemy now suffering at the hands of cruel fanatics, that made Geralt take pity on her. Aware of what fate awaited her if she lived, Síle de Tansarville was grateful to be given a dignified death, one free from torment and humiliation.<br>
   1059057|00000000||Yet Síle's wounds were serious - her life could not be saved. Time was running short, and so Geralt had to leave the dying sorceress to the fate that awaited her.<br>

   1062092|00000000||Witchers live to kill monsters, and so they place great importance on the weapons and armor they use. Bodily harm is all too common in this profession, so whenever the chance arises to acquire better work clothing, the thinking witcher pounces on it like a cat on a plump mouse. <br><br>Such a mouse skittered in front of Geralt's eyes at one point in the form of the dwarf Fergus, an armorer of great renown. The craftsman promised to forge top-notch equipment for our hero, but first he needed the appropriate tools. Geralt thus set out in search of them.<br>
   1062093|00000000||Geralt acquired the tools, but his adventure did not end there. In the meantime he learned Fergus' apprentice was the true master of the forge, and Fergus himself a mere figurehead. Apparently this arrangement came about because they thought no one would believe a woman could possess such talent. It seemed now the fickle apprentice had changed her mind and wished to assume her rightful place in the sun.<br><br>In order to prove her talent, she made Geralt do a bit of running around and act as an archer's target in a bizarre ordeal. Luckily, everything worked out and in the end our hero earned the gratitude of a true master armoress, who promised to forge him the best plate in the world.<br>
   1073878|00000000||Geralt acquired the tools, but in the end no armor would be forged with them. It turned out the real talent in the workshop belonged to Fergus' female understudy, the man himself being a mere figurehead there to assuage people who would never believe a woman could possess such talent. Geralt was asked to assist in proving this talent to all and sundry by acting as a human target of sorts - and this was too much for him. He refused to participate in this risky armor effectiveness trial, and thus the Nilfgaardian officer concluded Yoana was a fraud. After this, she packed up her things and left Velen for good. I hope, in the end, she found some place where they could appreciate her talent.
   1086985|00000000||During his travels, Geralt dropped by a certain forge and, while making conversation with the proprietor, asked whether the craftsman would be capable of forging equipment requiring the highest level of mastery. The smith shook his head glumly and directed the witcher to Velen - home, it was reputed, to a certain Fergus, master among masters and virtuouso of the smithing arts.

   1060647|00000000||It turned out not only Geralt was looking for Cirilla. Also on her trail – a mysterious elven mage. Like the witcher, he had gone to Keira Metz to inquire after Ciri's whereabouts. During this conversation he also revealed that he kept a hideout in the ruins near the village of Midcopse.<br>
   1060648|00000000||Geralt decided to follow up on this lead. Though he was not able to establish the mysterious mage's identity, he did learn that he had been traveling with Cirilla some time before and the Wild Hunt was after him as well.<br>
   1060707|00000000||Geralt's investigation in Skellige unearthed evidence that the mysterious elven mage had protected Ciri from certain death at the hands of the Wild Hunt's warriors.<br>
   1060708|00000000||As expected, the investigation Geralt and Yennefer conducted in Skellige unearthed valuable information about Ciri. Most interesting of all, they learned Ciri had not fled the Wild Hunt alone, but in the company of a mysterious elven mage.<br><br>It was only thanks to his intervention that Ciri was able to slip out of the ghastly riders' grasp.<br>
   1060709|00000000||Geralt learned that Ciri and her mysterious companion were separated upon arrival in Velen. Like Geralt, the mage had gone to Keira Metz and inquired after Ciri's whereabouts. During this conversation he also revealed that he kept a hideout in the ruins near the village of Midcopse.<br>
   1060710|00000000||Geralt decided to follow up on this lead. Though he was not able to establish the mysterious mage's identity, the message the elf had left made it clear he had known Cirilla for quite some time.<br>
   1060711|00000000||Skjall's words drew a new detail onto the emerging picture of the mage. After the Wild Hunt's attack, Skjall had seen Ciri and a mysterious elf sail away from Skellige, their course set for the high seas.

   1085134|00000000||Ciri encountered plenty of liars, scoundrels and villains along her path - but luckily happened on some decent folk as well. Certainly worthy of being counted among the latter was Skjall, a young warrior from Lofoten. Initially, he and his family tended to Ciri's wounds, nursed her back to health, then he helped her flee the Wild Hunt. In doing so, he sacrificed the thing Skelligers hold dearest: his honor. Accused of cowardice, he was forced to perform a heroic deed to clear his name. Sadly, he failed. Mortally wounded by a beast in an abandoned garden, he suffered a slow, painful and lonely death.<br>
   1085074|00000000||Ciri could not restore Skjall's life or even clear his unjustly sullied reputation - but at least she was able to give him a proper burial. Skellige legend holds that Skjall's soul now dines with his ancestors in the Heavenly Feast Hall, where mead flows in torrents and the ballads never cease. Though my own nature does not tend towards the religious, I must admit I would very much like this to be true.

   1019282|00000000||Started harmless. Lighthouse just stopped burnin' one night. Without that light, ships can't make Arinbjorn safely, so we sent two men to see what'd happened.

   1052553|00000000||Before Geralt and Yennefer parted after their adventure in Freya's garden, the sorceress asked him to meet her in Larvik. She made it clear this was a personal matter, but gave no further details.<br>
   1052554|00000000||Geralt duly traveled to Larvik, where Yennefer revealed to him her plan: she intended to capture a djinn and draw on its power. Brrr, the very thought of it makes my skin crawl and my throat constrict! For, dear reader, I have had the misfortune of dealing with a djinn once in my life, and I assure you - once was one time too many. Most djinns, you see, combine incredible power with a mean streak a mile long. In short, they are nasty beings that prudent people should steer well clear of. <br><br>Yet when Yennefer sets her sights on something, there's no turning back. Geralt glumly realized this and decided to help her handle the dangers that would surely arise during this mad endeavor. Yennefer had managed to learn about a certain scholar who had devoted his entire life to delving into the secrets of djinns. He had died in mysterious circumstances during a shipwreck off the coast of Hindarsfjall. That is where Geralt and Yennefer decided to begin their search.<br>
   1052580|00000000||The trail they followed took Geralt and Yennefer from the bottom of the sea off the coast of Hindarsfjall to the snowy peaks towering above Ard Skellig. There, barging recklessly in where even dragons should fear to tread, they summoned the djinn and tried to capture it. The djinn, however, had no intention of giving up without a fight and resisted with all its strength.<br><br>Together witcher and sorceress managed to pin this feisty spirit. Once it understood its situation was hopeless, Yennefer could convince it to do what she wanted - release Geralt and her from the spell another djinn had cast on them long ago. This spell had made it so that Geralt and Yennefer, despite their many differences, could not live without each other. Now they had a chance to see if, once the spell was no longer in effect, the magic between them would still persist...<br>
   1052644|00000000||The truth did not disappoint. The captured djinn dispelled its predecessor's work… and the feelings between Geralt and the sorceress burned on as fiery as ever. Many an admirer breathed a heavy sigh on that day, when the bond between these two renowned beauties closed tight, crushing all outsiders' hopes...
   1052668|00000000||The truth came as a brutal shock to Yennefer, though she was not the kind to let this show. After the djinn dispelled its predecessor's work, Geralt confessed that he no longer felt towards her what he once had. Hearts heavy, they returned to Kaer Trolde and then went their separate ways.
   1087038|00000000||Though Yennefer had made it clear the matter was important to her, Geralt made it equally clear he was in no mood to be her errand boy yet again. He left her in Skellige and returned to his own affairs.

   1053903|00000000||An abandoned home, or even an abandoned village, was no rare sight in the Velen of those days, but a certain set of ruins attracted Geralt's particular attention. He decided to find out what exactly was responsible for the manor's sorry state.<br>
   1053904|00000000||A Novigrad merchant told Geralt about a mage named Aeramas. The poor man had, like so many of his colleagues, met a gruesome death on a pyre. With no surviving heirs, his expansive rural residence was now abandoned - and, if the rumors about this eccentric sorcerer were true, inside it awaited a great many curiosities and valuable secrets...<br>
   1053905|00000000||Geralt searched the abandoned residence from top to bottom. Among the assorted worthless trinkets, he found some true treasures which Aeramas had cleverly hid from the world by setting murderous cheeses as guards. Tyromancers are not normally the cheery sort, but Aeramas certainly would have been delighted to know that his treasure had ended up in good hands.
   1070685|00000000||Geralt investigated Aeramas' estate and discovered the mage had been a raring tyromancy enthusiast - tyromancy being, as you surely know, the art of divining the future from cheese. This is a very rare specialization among mages, one only practiced by those for whom a social life is not a high priority - there reason being that the cheese they use to divine with is, and pardon my blunt language, fouler smelling than a drowner's scrotum. No wonder Aeramas' home hadn't been looted.<br>

   1051296|00000000||Once Geralt had helped both Lambert and Eskel, Yennefer was ready to lift Uma's curse. Yet in a surprise twist, Vesemir demanded they wait. The old witcher wanted to try his own, less risky method before the sorceress went about her invasive business. The others all bowed to his seniority and wisdom and let him take Uma to treat as he wished - leaving them with an unexpectedly free evening to fill. Eskel timidly suggested they spend this time productively, but this suggestion lost out to a more attractive alternative - a night of drink and camaraderie.<br>
   1051298|00000000||During their well-lubricated gathering Yennefer finally revealed her plan to the witchers: if Vesemir proved unable to lift Uma's curse, she would subject the being to the Trials of Grasses. These were the exceptionally dangerous and painful alchemical procedures young boys used to be forced to undergo in order to become witchers. It is no wonder, then, that Yennefer's intentions proved highly controversial. The sorceress defended her idea, holding that only by preparing Uma's body in this drastic way would it be able to survive the shock of lifting the curse. This upsetting news needed to be properly digested. And so, after Yennefer went to sleep, the witchers turned to the tried and true digestive-aiding powers of hard alcohol, card playing and the recounting of ribald tales.<br>

It is no wonder, then, that Yennefer's intentions proved highly controversial. The sorceress defended her idea, holding that only by preparing Uma's body in this drastic way would it be able to survive the shock of lifting the curse. This unsettling news needed time to be properly digested, and so the witchers broke out a few more bottles and exchanged some stories with Yennefer before heading to bed. They had a very big day ahead of them - a day in which they just might find Ciri.<br>
   1062502|00000000||Yet even a witcher's body can only handle so much toxicity - and once this limit is passed, one must prepare for the unusual and the disturbing, a fact Hierarch Hemmelfart learned first-hand.<br>

   1055046|00000000||Though druids have gained fame worldwide as outstanding healers, even with all their spells and elixirs they at times prove powerless against diseases. Such was the case with Egill - a druid who had lost his voice. His friend decided that, since traditional methods had failed, it was time to try newer, more innovative approaches. It fell to Geralt to test them.<br>
   1055047|00000000||Thanks to Geralt's efforts, Egill did indeed speak once more - in order to give Geralt a thorough tongue lashing. It turned out the druid had not lost his voice due to illness, but had sworn a vow of silence for religious reasons. Instead of helping a man to recover, it seemed Geralt had taken part in a rather awful practical joke.

   1055060|00000000||Hubert Rejk seemed like a kind, gentle and accommodating man - but in truth he was a bloodthirsty, brutal and murderous vampire, hiding a twisted and fanatical mind behind his never-changing mask of eternal youth. Geralt cut him down after an extraordinarily difficult duel, avenging my Priscilla's suffering and saving the lives of the countless others who surely would have died by this base monster's hands.<br>
   1055056|00000000||Telling this story, my dear reader, will tax me greatly. It is a dark and somber one, encompassing the greatest sorrow my heart has ever known. It all started the day of the grand opening of my cabaret. Everything had been spit-polished to perfection - all that was left was to wait for Priscilla, whose performance was to be the crowning moment of this glorious evening. Yet when the doors of the Chameleon burst open it was not she who stepped inside. Instead, it was a messenger from the Vilmerius Hospital. His face pale and his countenance dour, he informed us Priscilla had been badly wounded in an assault - and was currently tottering on the brink of death.<br>
   1055059|00000000||Geralt's investigation took him to Crippled Kate's, a pleasure house of questionable repute. It is there, according to the note left by the murderer in Patricia Vegelbud's body, that the fiend would take his next victim - a prostitute named Sweet Nettie.<br><br>Geralt entered her room and found the Reverend Nathaniel, whom he had met earlier at the morgue, inside. The situation was clear - Nathanial was standing over Nettie with a white-hot poker in his hand - so Geralt meted out justice to this cruel and perverted man without batting an eye.<br>

   1055061|00000000||Sadly, though Nathaniel was guilty of many sins, serial killing was not among them. Some time after his death Geralt happened across the body of another victim, one mutilated in an all-too-familiar way. This time, however, the murderer had learned from experience and wiped all possible clues to his identity. The witcher thus could not catch him, and the death of countless innocents, and my Priscilla's suffering, went unavenged.
   1087099|00000000||How great was my gratitude when Geralt rushed off after that hideous fiend who had done such harm to my Priscilla! Yet days passed, and the witcher never returned with updates on the progress of his investigation. Soon enough, I had to confront the fact that we would never catch the degenerate scoundrel. Strengthened by Priscilla's improving condition, I focused instead on the hope that one day she and I would sing together in beautiful duet once more...

   1051220|00000000||Imagine Geralt's surprise when he found out Muggs had not actually been robbed. Far from it, in fact - the scoundrel had lost his documents fair and square in a game of cards.<br>
   1051221|00000000||Geralt successfully retrieved Muggs' documents. I must say, though Geralt is always repeating that he doesn't get involved in the affairs of others... the facts don't really bear him out.

   1059023|00000000||When the children in the swamp clearing first told Geralt about Johnny, the witcher had every reason to suppose no such person actually existed. It was difficult to imagine anyone living in such inhospitable surroundings without quickly becoming food for drowners or water hags.<br><br>Geralt thus suspected Johnny was the figment of childish imaginations, an imaginary friend for lonely orphans. Long years of experience, however, told him not to ignore any possible lead, so he decided to search the nearby swampland for any additional signs of Johnny.<br>
   1059037|00000000||It turned out the orphans were not lying - Johnny really did exist. He was not a human child but a godling, one of a rare breed of creatures that can be found scattered about the Continent's wildernesses.<br><br>Unfortunately Johnny had lost his voice in circumstances he obviously could not explain, and so neither could he provide much in the way of answers to Geralt's questions.<br>
   1059038|00000000||Once Geralt had helped him regain his voice, however, he talked up a veritable storm, giving the lie to all the tales of these legendary beings' supposed shyness. Johnny also agreed to convince Gran to put Geralt in touch with the Ladies of the Wood.<br>
   1059039|00000000||I know from personal experience that a good heart, noble reflexes and the wrong word at the wrong time can get a fellow in all sorts of trouble. Johnny learned this as well when he tried to intercede on Gran's behalf with the Crones and succeeded only in attracting their wrath.<br>
   1059040|00000000||Geralt had thought his and Johnny's paths would never cross again, but fate had other plans. When he and Ciri arrived at the Crones' sabbath they ran into Johnny. He was with Sarah,  another Godling Geralt knew from a previous adventure in Novigrad.<br><br>The witchers learned both godlings had received an offer they couldn't refuse from the Crones and, willing or not, would have to attend the sabbath. They had no intention of tarrying there long, however, and when the first opportunity arrived they seized it and left that filth-ridden place. Before they did, Johnny told Geralt and Ciri what to do to gain access to the peak of the mountain, where Imlerith himself was celebrating the dark feast.<br>

   1050772|00000000||Witchers should be neutral, avoid meddling in the affairs of others. But at times, it's hard to be indifferent… While searching for Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir stopped by the tavern in the village of White Orchard. When a row erupted in the establishment soon afterwards, Vesemir decided to defend the besieged innkeep. Unfortunately, instead of calming the situation, he inflamed it. The witchers were forced to draw their steel swords. Those they use to kill humans.<br>
   1050773|00000000||They say idioms are the wisdom of nations. But the saying "With many against one, even a witcher's done" rarely proves true. Though their foes held the advantage in numbers, Geralt and Vesemir tended to them handily. Unfortunately, the innkeeper they had sought to protect hardly appreciated the gesture. Terrified at the bloody massacre, she tossed her saviors out the door.
    343482|00000000||The Incident at White Orchard
   1051294|00000000||The task of preparing the phylactery fell to Lambert, to his great dissatisfaction. His discontent came as no surprise to me when I learned of it - Lambert was not the most obliging of fellows, and Yennefer, well, let us just say she was not his favorite individual. Nevertheless, Lambert agreed to do the job, and Geralt felt he had no choice but to accompany him.<br>
   1051295|00000000||Geralt and Lambert braved the dangerous path to the Circle of Elements, which took them across a drowner- and foglet-infested lake, through the cave in which Old Speartip slept, and over mountain passes home to mistrustful and treacherous rock trolls. Along the way all the differences between Geralt and his younger comrade were exposed in sharp contrast. Sparks flew between them more than once, and biting commentary and barbed remarks were the order of the day. Geralt tolerated Lambert's prickliness with admirable stoicism, for he knew that the younger witcher's famous sarcasm served only to cover his many deeply-felt, never-healed wounds.

   1077921|00000000||<i>We never hunt in these woods. Never. Even if it means the whole village starves.</i><br>– Mulliver, ealdorman of Hoshberg in lower Aedirn<br><br>Leshens dwell in dense, primeval woods. Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory – and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Leshens old enough to earn the appellation "ancient" wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.<br>
   1077922|00000000||In some areas of the world these creatures form the center of local cults. Peasants living near their woods make offerings to them, usually of hares and birds, though human blood is not unheard of. This fact has given rise to many legends about helpful leshens chasing game towards hunters, helping lost travelers find their way in the forest or saving them from bandits. Sadly, these tales do not have an ounce of truth in them. Leshens see men only as sources of energy on which to feed. They will drain the life force of those who live nearby until only limpid husks remain.<br><br>Some leshens create magic totems that increase their strength – in such cases these totems should be destroyed before or while fighting them. Furthermore, some leshens can create for themselves a kind of immortality in the following way: the leshen wounds a lost traveler passing through its woods with its claws and casts a black magic curse on him. For as long as the individual marked in this way stays near its territory, the leshen will be reborn every time it dies. Such leshens can only be defeated by driving away or killing the person they have marked.<br><br>In combat leshens use not only their long claws but also their many allies: wolves, who unfailingly answer their call, or ravens, which harass and distract the leshen's opponent. Leshens are also able to bend plant life to their will and make it aid them in battle. It is a witcher's good fortune that leshens do have one weakness - they are extremely vulnerable to the Igni Sign.

   1061610|00000000||Geralt also noted that Von Gratz seemed quite experienced at navigating the sewers and fighting the monsters dwelling within it.<br>
   1061611|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.<br>
   1061612|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue. When asked why, von Gratz explained that, thirty years earlier, Hubert had denounced him to the authorities for his political activities.<br>
   1061613|00000000||The coroner confirmed what his former student claimed, yet added an additional detail - he had made his denunciation only after von Gratz's activities had resulted in several deaths.<br>
   1061614|00000000||In the end von Gratz was eliminated as a suspect, but like Geralt he had to admit defeat in his attempts to outwit the psychopathic murderer.<br>

   1061633|00000000||The dwarves have been in the banking business since the legendary King Desmond of Temeria was just a snot-nosed brat in short trousers asking for more "yam" with his "bwed." Since then, the prominent dwarven banking families - the Giancardis, the Vivaldis and the Cianfanellis - have only expanded their services, establishing branches in all the larger cities of the North.<br><br>Vimme Vivaldi carried the torch of this venerable tradition into modern times, growing the Novigrad branch of his family's bank until it was the largest in the city. Geralt and I had met him over a dozen years before our story begins and had always appreciated his honesty and financial acumen.<br><br>The latter he gave further proof of during the time in which our story takes place, for his bank remained profitable even in the face of growing nonhuman oppression.<br>

   1060987|00000000||It can be difficult for a woman to gain the esteem of knights and warriors not accustomed to seeing female hands on the reins of power. It helps little when, like Birna, widow of King Bran of Skellige, the woman seeking power is filled with acrid disdain for her countrymen and their customs. One might argue that disdain is a valid reaction when, in the case of the passing of a man of power who embodies tradition, those customs call on her to follow long since outdated ritual and cast herself on her husband's funeral pyre.<br><br>Justified or not, Birna's desire to rewrite age-old Skellige traditions put her at odds with the jarls and made it unlikely she would be remembered alongside Calanthe of Cintra or Meve of Lyria as a successful and revered ruler.<br>
   1060988|00000000||Birna likewise refused to hide her disgust with the custom of choosing a ruler by vote of the jarls. She dreamed of establishing a hereditary kingship in Skellige and thought the ideal dynasty to hold it was her own, starting with her and Bran's son, the young Svanrige.<br>
   1060989|00000000||In all probability it was this longing for power that drove Birna to concoct the conspiracy that ended in the massacre at Kaer Trolde.<br>
   1060990|00000000||The evidence gathered by Geralt and Cerys sealed Birna's fate.<br>
   1060993|00000000||Birna fulfilled her dream of placing her son on the throne of Skellige, but her plans to control Svanrige's every action were foiled. The freshly-crowned king quickly made it clear he would rule on his own.

This time, however, the shoe was on the other foot: a certain Hans of Cidaris, a soldier of fortune by trade, had made it known far and wide that he would pay a handsome sum to whoever could defeat the beast that had made its nest in the forest outside Oxenfurt. Geralt decided to take on the job.<br>
   1051372|00000000||Mercenaries are usually the ones getting paid for killing things. This time, however, the shoe was on the other foot: a certain Hans of Cidaris, a soldier of fortune by trade, offered to pay Geralt a handsome sum for defeating the beast that had made its nest in the forest outside Oxenfurt. Geralt decided to accept this contract.<br>
   1051373|00000000||While passing through the area around Oxenfurt, Geralt came across tracks left by a dangerous monster. Though he had not received any contract for this beast, he nevertheless decided to follow its trail.<br>
   1051374|00000000||Geralt's investigation led him to conclude that an archgriffin had taken up residence in the ravine. This creature was in most respects similar to the royal griffin Geralt had fought in White Orchard, but with the added nastiness of being able to spit a noxious acid at its prey.<br>
   1051375|00000000||Geralt defeated the beast - and discovered a highly interesting document in its lair.

The Crones of Crookback Bog are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. <br><br>Common folk have given these three sisters the names Weavess, Brewess and Whispess, and call the threesome "The Ladies of the Wood" or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of Velen, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.<br><br>The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.

   1015155|00000000||Welcome.
   1062575|00000000||A hard life awaits the child who cannot escape his parents' shadow. Following the death of his father, the beloved King Bran, Svanrige became the formal ruler of Clan Tuirseach, which controlled vast territory on the isle of An Skellig.<br><br>Yet this quiet and mild-mannered young man seemed firmly tied to the apron strings of his mother, Birna, who sought to control his every waking deed. With such an overbearing caretaker it was hard to imagine how Svanrige could ever grow into a man able to rule a mighty Skellige clan in his own right.<br>
   1062576|00000000||Svanrige's election as ruler of Skellige was a rather unexpected turn of events. It was widely thought to have been the result of backroom maneuvering by Birna, who used the chaos in the aftermath of the other claimants' deaths and the shame that fell on the an Craites to achieve her ambition of placing a puppet in her control on the Skellige throne.<br>
   1062577|00000000||It thus came as a great shock for her when young Svanrige showed his claws and tore up the humiliating treaty with Nilfgaard she wanted him to sign - and then washed the shame of this near-submission from the isles with the blood of their eternal enemy. This blood simultaneously wiped away any doubts whether the new king was worthy of the crown.<br>

   1050775|00000000||During his travels through No Man's Land Geralt ran into the pellar once more. The strange fellow had a favor to ask of the witcher. He wanted Geralt to help him perform a cherished local peasant rite known as Forefathers' Eve. During this ritual, he explained, lost spirits are summoned and their deeds judged - fantastic material, by the way, for a poet looking to make his name with an atmospheric ballad. This Forefathers' Eve was set to be held at midnight on Fyke Isle, and Geralt, having no other plans and his curiosity piqued, promised to attend.<br>
   1050789|00000000||On Fyke Isle the pellar led the witcher through the arcane rites that marked the opening of Forefathers' Eve. Alas and alack, uninvited guests then arrived and threatened to break up the ritual before its conclusion. The witch hunters considered what the peasants practiced on Fyke Isle to be vile necromancy, and demanded they stop it at once.<br>
   1050795|00000000||Witchers do their best to remain neutral, and so Geralt felt he should not get involved in what was, in the end, a dispute between humans. He thus did not lift a finger as the witch hunters scattered the peasants and brought the ritual to a premature conclusion.<br>
   1050796|00000000||Abandoning his rule of not taking sides in others' affairs, the witcher chose to defend the ritual's participants. Predictably, this did not please the witch hunters one bit. A bloody fight broke out on Fyke Isle, and though it ended in victory for Geralt, it had a disastrous effect on the rest of the ritual.<br>
   1050798|00000000||Geralt had defended the peasants from the witch hunters' persecution, but spilled much blood in order to do so, sullying the sacred ground. Forefathers' Eve could not continue, but the pellar had one more request for Geralt. He wanted him to find and burn the body of Old Ambros. This man was the pellar's father, a cruel brute who returned from the dead to continue tormenting his son. Burning the body was a way to resolve the pellar's issues with his father and send the ghost of Old Ambros into the nether realms for good.<br>
   1050797|00000000||As you can imagine, the pellar was not pleased by Geralt's indifference in the face of the witch hunters' persecution. Many a bitter word was uttered and then each went his own way.

   1051270|00000000||Geralt had learned that Rosa var Attre was a passionate devotee of the art of swordplay. The fencing lesson Geralt had given her while searching for yours truly had thrilled her to the core - and left her asking the witcher if they could meet again for a repeat. Geralt had plenty of experience teaching young women with fiery personalities how to swing swords and so agreed.<br>
   1051271|00000000||Once they were done with their lesson Geralt was supposed to escort the young lady home. Rosa, however, was clearly still in the mood for some recreation and gave him the slip during a moment of inattention. The witcher knew he needed to find her - or land himself in a heap of trouble.<br>
   1051272|00000000||Rosa found out for herself that not all residents of Novigrad respect diplomatic immunity. The witcher saved her from a tight spot - but also discovered a dark side to her character. It was clear to them both that there would be no third fencing lesson.
    532938|00000000||Go to the var Attre residence tomorrow to give Rosa fencing lessons.

   1055116|00000000||The Vegelbud family's out-of-town estate was famed not only for its lovely guardians and sumptuous banquets, but also for the series of horse races organized there in honor of one of the line's illustrious ancestors, Erasmus. Geralt, who had spent a great many years in the saddle, decided to test his mettle in this derby - lured, perhaps, by the sizable reward promised to the victor.<br>
   1055117|00000000||The Vegelbud races segued into an unexpected encore. Cleaver, one of the Novigrad  crime lords, was so impressed by the witcher's riding prowess that he offered him the chance to take part in the equally famed (though illegal) race organized by the local underworld.<br>
   1055118|00000000||Though the nighttime race was rife with obstacles, Geralt managed to win it as well. Sadly, he was not given long to celebrate his triumph, for the city guard, alarmed by the ruckus of galloping horses at an hour when decent people should be asleep, broke up the event and scattered its participants.

   1086963|00000000||<br>In his fight with the forktail, Geralt gave proof not only of his masterful swordsmanship, but also of a previously-undemonstrated flair for shepherdry. With a little help from a brave sheep lent by the village elder, he lured the monster into a trap - then ended its life.

   1081763|00000000||Few truly know what a dragon looks like, for those who have seen one up-close rarely have the chance to share their impressions. That is why people are forever mistaking other monsters for dragons. This was the case in Fyresdal, where the so-called dragon wreaking havoc turned out to be a forktail.<br><br>Yet this mistaken attribution did not mean there was no reason for worry. The forktail harassing Fyresdal was a particularly vile representative of its kind, one equipped with an endless store of deadly venom.

   1051874|00000000||With the witcher's help I was able to make my castle in the clouds a heaven on earth - I opened my cabaret and called it The Chameleon. Ah, if you'd only seen the pride in Priscilla's eyes when our hard-working dwarven remodelers hung that reptile-adorned signboard above our doors! What a tragic shame later events did not go at all as we had dreamed...
   1051873|00000000||Ever since that fateful eve near twenty years ago when my dear friend Geralt and I visited a no-longer-extant cabaret in the once-beautiful city of Oxenfurt, I have longed with every fiber of my being to become the owner of just such an establishment. When Alonso Wily, more commonly known as Whoreson Senior, left me the Rosemary and Thyme in his will, my dreams finally began to assume a more concrete form. When Priscilla lent her support to the endeavor, the scales tipped decidedly towards action and the ball threatened to start rolling. I needed just a few things more to begin my planned remodeling of the Rosemary and Thyme into a cabaret - and so I turned to Geralt, the fiercest fetcher in the world.<br>
   1085025|00000000||At last I was free - and never had the nectar of liberty tasted so sweet. No matter how I slurped, I could not imbibe it fast enough. I filled every waking hour, and quite a few sleeping ones, with fevered activity - there was so much to do, and so little time in which to do it! Since the witcher had proven a true and reliable friend time and time again, I asked him for help, and he readily agreed to provide it.
   1087093|00000000||So it goes with Geralt - often he burns with eager enthusiasm at first, only to then have the fires wane and his interest stray elsewhere. Despite his promises to assist me in putting together my cabaret, in the end he saw to other matters instead - and without his help, I was unable to get the job done. Oh well - perhaps one day, when times are more settled, I'll remind him he owes me help starting a cabaret.

   1050920|00000000||The common folk rarely show witchers the gratitude they deserve for practicing their dangerous trade. Arinbjorn, however, proved an even more ungrateful place than usual in this regard. After taking care of a wraith plaguing this village, Geralt stepped into the local tavern in search of a well-earned drink. Before he could even take a sip, however, two trouble-seeking youths started harassing him. Geralt usually strives to avoid bloodshed in such situations... but this time he had no choice.<br>
   1050921|00000000||Though Geralt had killed his attackers in self-defense, no witnesses confirmed this and he was charged with starting the brawl. The inhabitants of Arinbjorn urged Geralt to put down his weapons and hand himself over to the jarl, Madman Lugos. Wanting no more blood on his hands that day, Geralt reluctantly delivered himself to the justice of a lunatic.<br>
   1050922|00000000||Geralt stood before Madman Lugos to be tried. The jarl found him guilty, but then immediately paid his blood price for him, thus giving him his freedom. In this way Lugos repaid the witcher for the help he had given his son in the Cave of Dreams.

   1061142|00000000||Many brave warriors answered Hjalmar's call to join him in reconquering Undvik from the Ice Giant. Among them - Folan, son of Ulf, Hjalmar's frequent comrade in battle and dear childhood friend. Folan, a member of Clan Tuirseach, was a fearless sailor and an unequaled archer, and so did not hesitate to join this dangerous expedition that stood to shower him in glory.<br><br>It would have ended horribly for him, however, had the witcher not kept his wits about him and saved him from the clutches of hungry trolls by winning a riddle contest.<br>
   1061143|00000000||Folan proved his skill with a bow by riddling the Ice Giant with arrows during the final fight against the colossus, a deed recounted to this day during Kaer Trolde feasts.<br>
   1061144|00000000||In order to pay the White Wolf back for saving his life, Folan set out with Hjalmar defend Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt. There, far from his native land, Folan fell in battle while fighting side by side with his friends.

   1077718|00000000||I've stopped the bleeding. I need to collect my thoughts.<br><br>I could go for help. There's a village not far, I can hear dogs barking. But people would see what uniform I wear. They'd ask what I was doing in the swamps. They'd figure it out. They'd take everything, maybe kill me. This is Velen, after all.<br><br>I've lost a quart of blood. Maybe more. If the wound is still clean come dawn, I should pull through. I'll leave at daylight, maybe then the drowners won't attack. I'll bury the treasure and head to Novigrad. Should be able to find a decent man there to patch me up. Someone who won't ask questions. Who doesn't care if you're a deserter.<br><br>All that's left to me now is to pray that no one sees the tracks I left. That they don't follow the blood trail and find the treasure. But no one will come through here. I hope. Everything will be fine.<br>
   1077719|00000000||It seems the wounded deserter never made it to Novigrad nor decided to ask the nearby villagers for help. Instead, he died alone in the swamp, leaving behind his treasure. The witcher mourned his tragedy, but rejoiced in his own good luck.

   1077712|00000000||<i>Now finish your soup, or a berserker'll come and swallow ye whole.</i><br>– Skellige mother scolding a child.<br><br>Skellige legends speak of men known as berserkers who transform into bears when overwhelmed by battle rage. In doing so, they lose all self-awareness and are driven by a bloodlust which they must satiate in order to return to human form. Few believe these blood-curdling tales, however, not even in Skellige, where the inhabitants usually treat even the least probable legends with the utmost gravity. This indicates either that berserkers are in fact mere figments of mead-sodden imaginations, or else that they have learned to hide their abilities from the rest of the islanders.<br>
   1077713|00000000||The skalds' ballads indicate a berserker transformed in the heat of battle cannot be distinguished from a true-born bear. Only minute anatomical details - such as the shape of their tongues and teeth - reveal their secret. Descriptions of their fighting prowess paint them as invulnerable to pain and able to heal any wound received almost at once.<br><br>If these men-turned-bears truly do exist, one can suppose that, like werewolves and lycanthropes, they are particularly vulnerable to oils that harm cursed creatures. But if we are to give credence to ancient songs about these creatures' deeds, about the mass murders and massacres they have committed, we can only hope that no witcher will have to test this hypothesis.

   1077928|00000000||<i>Chorts are smaller than fiends, true. But still big enough to kill.</i><br>– Agnes Thistle, herbalist from the Black Forest<br><br>Chorts are the somewhat smaller kin of fiends and bumbakvetches.  Yet any witcher who thinks their diminutive stature means they present no danger commits a grave error – the kind that can end his career permanently. These denizens of dark and ancient woods are some of the most dangerous monsters known to man.<br>
   1077929|00000000||Legends often mistake chorts for sylvans, ascribing to them the ability to speak, stand on two legs, gobble up cabbage, play pranks and work mischief around the household. The arrival of a true chort in a region soon puts an end to such tales. The creatures do not speak, at best communicating with each other through grunts, snorts and moans. They get about on four legs and as for their "mischief"... they destroy farmsteads, devouring anything that can be devoured, including cabbage, if such is available, but also extending to poultry, pork, the family dog and then the family itself. <br><br>Chorts fight with little finesse, running straight towards their opponent and trying to knock him to the ground with the force of their charge. After downing their foe they bite, kick and strike with their claw-tipped paws. Due to their size and four-legged posture, they are mostly unperturbed by the force of the Aard Sign, and the regenerative powers of their body allow any wounds they receive to heal at a rapid pace.  <i></i>

    488038|00000000||Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon – what can I possibly say about her? That we call her Ciri for short, that she was born in 1251, that she has ashen hair and a scar on her cheek?<br><br>All true, and that's the Cirilla I know best, the one I first laid eyes upon those many years ago, the one who seemed thoroughly, well, not ordinary, but certainly not as extraordinary as she in fact is.<br><br>For Cirilla is also a highly-skilled witcher, heiress to several thrones, the last bearer of the Elder Blood, a powerful Source endowed with exceptional magic talent and the Lady of Time and Space. Her hair color and date of birth seem... rather incidental now, don't they? <br><br>I could also tell you she is Geralt's adopted daughter – but that would be a gross simplification. Ciri is much more. She is his Destiny, his Unexpected Child, someone bound to the witcher by Fate's most inextricably tangled fetters. <br><br>Following age-old witcher tradition, Geralt took Ciri to Kaer Morhen when she came into his care. There he and Vesemir taught her in the ways of the professional monster slayer. It was then that her magic talents were first revealed, and they discovered she was a Source. <br>Ciri's gift proved a curse as well. Because of it, she would one day have to hide from the entire world – even Geralt.
    492593|00000000||Ciri's biography contained one more great secret. Her natural father was none other than the emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis. His words confirmed the fears swirling in Geralt's mind. Ciri had returned and was in mortal danger, for the unrelenting Wild Hunt was on her trail.<br>
   1062528|00000000||Yennefer made it clear why the Wild Hunt wanted Ciri: Eredin wanted the power latent in her Elder Blood. She also let Geralt know that Ciri had been seen in war-ravaged Velen as well as in Novigrad, the largest city in the world.<br>
   1062529|00000000||Reports that Ciri had spent time at Crow's Perch proved true. She was there as the guest of the local warlord, Phillip Strenger, also known as the Bloody Baron. Despite his violent moniker, this man treated Ciri with kindness and respect.<br>
   1062530|00000000||It seemed that during Ciri's time in Velen she got into a quarrel with some sort of witch or witches in the swamps.<br>
   1062531|00000000||Geralt learned the truth of Ciri's time in the swamps from the mouths of the hideous Crones themselves. Even Ciri, better able to hold her own than most anyone in existence, was lucky to escape from these powerful beings alive and intact.<br>
   1062532|00000000||The visions revealed by the Mask of Uroboros made it clear beyond all doubt: Ciri had played a role in the magic catastrophe on Ard Skellig. More importantly, they confirmed she had been in Skellige - and then fled in the face of grave danger.<br>
   1062533|00000000||Ultimate, tangible proof of the truth that the emperor had spoken the truth about Ciri's pursuers came in the form of a corpse – one belonging to a warrior of the Wild Hunt. The Riders truly were on Ciri's trail.<br>
   1062536|00000000||In hindsight, putting Ciri in touch with Whoreson was not one of my brightest ideas. In my defense, I can only say that her situation was so perilous even the riskiest plan seemed better than inactivity.<br>
   1062537|00000000||After many adventures and mishaps, Geralt finally found Ciri on the Isle of Mists. When he crossed the threshold into the room in which she slumbered, the protective spell Avallac'h had cast upon her snapped under the sheer weight of their combined destinies. Geralt was reunited with his adopted daughter after years of separation and searching. No words can describe the joy he felt in that moment.<br>
   1062542|00000000||Avallac'h's prediction that the Wild Hunt would descend on Kaer Morhen as soon as Ciri arrived was proven true. All present spared no effort in defending her. In the end, though, it was she who defended them – through an outburst of unbridled power, the raw strength of her Elder Blood, she saved the protectors of Kaer Morhen from certain death.<br>
   1062543|00000000||Though it was Cirilla who convinced Geralt to go with her to exact vengeance on Imlerith, it was the witcher who stood against Vesemir's killer in a final duel. Ciri slay some evil that day, however, killing two of the three monstrous sisters who had usurped for themselves rule over Velen.<br>
   1062544|00000000||Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that. Standing face to face with him was surely one of the most difficult challenges she had ever undergone.<br>
   1062546|00000000||Ciri passed this trial with flying colors, but the fact that Geralt accepted payment for bringing her in for this talk caused her great pain.<br>
   1062545|00000000||Ciri emerged from this trial victorious, and with an enhanced awareness of how deeply and unconditionally Geralt, her adopted father, loved and cared for her.<br>
   1062547|00000000||Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that.  It was thus no surprise that Ciri did not even want to see him.<br>
   1062548|00000000||Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears I can conclude that she let the mistresses of magic know in clear terms that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.<br>
   1062551|00000000||Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears, I can conclude that, with a bit of help from Geralt, she let the mistresses of magic know that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.<br>
   1062550|00000000||A visit to Avallac'h's secret laboratory revealed facts that shook Ciri to her core. Though she had long known she was the last of Lara Dorren's line, the only remaining heir to the so-called Elder Blood, only know did she realize this line had been an object of unbroken interest to elven Sages and human mages for two centuries. Another blow came from the words of the arrogant she-elf, which rankled in her heart like a thorny bramble.<br>
   1062552|00000000||Though anger and hurt threatened to overwhelm her, Ciri did not give in to her emotions. Geralt's words helped her in this, leaving her with no doubt how precious she was to him.<br>
   1062553|00000000||Cirilla wanted to visit the grave of Skjall, the young man who had put his life and honor on the line to help her. Though purely symbolic, this gesture brought a modicum of much-needed comfort to her soul.<br>
   1062554|00000000||Eredin had perished - but the evil king's death only ever heralds the end in fairy tales. In our store, this meant it was time for Ciri to face her destiny. Only she possessed the power to stop the White Frost - the near mythical force which threatened not just our world, but countless others as well.<br>
   1062549|00000000||Though unleashing anger on inanimate objects might not be considered mature behavior, it definitely helps bring one relief. Ciri thus reached for this most simple of solutions.<br>

   1044120|00000000||Geralt's search for information about the baron's wife and daughter took him to the local pellar.

Having no other choice, Geralt set off on a wild goat chase.<br>

   1083270|00000000||Find Graham.
   1002061|00000000||A horrible curse had befallen Fyke Isle and the tower that stood upon it. Half a year prior, Lord Vserad had moved his court there, seeking shelter from approaching Nilfgaardian armies. While famine raged all around, the lord of Velen wallowed in excess and cared not a whit for his suffering vassals. The gods saw fit to punish him and, towards this end, cursed him. One day, a host of mice scurried into the tower and proceeded to devour everything, including Vserad, his court and his resident mage, Alexander.<br><br>The isle had been haunted since that day, and fishermen feared to sail the lake, putting yet another dent in the already battered local economy. The local peasants thus asked Keira to lift the curse, and she turned to the witcher for help. Enticed by Keira's charms and her promise of additional rewards, Geralt took on the task. The sorceress equipped him with a magic lamp he could use to commune with dead souls, gave him a firm pat on the rear for good luck and sent him off to lift the curse.<br>
   1002062|00000000||During his investigation of the isle, Geralt discovered the lord's daughter, Anabelle, was the key to lifting the curse. She had died along with the others and her spirit now roamed the tower's empty halls, trapped in this vale of tears by her love for a fisherman named Graham.<br><br>Geralt thought taking her remains to the fisherman would solve everything - but instead it led to catastrophe. Anabelle, he discovered, was not an unfortunate lost soul but a dangerous plague maiden. The wraith had tricked Geralt - when he removed Anabelle's remains from the tower the plague maiden was freed from her prison and ventured out into the world to spread disease and pestilence.<br>
   1002063|00000000||During his investigation of the isle, Geralt discovered the lord's daughter, Anabelle, was the key to lifting the curse. She had died along with the others and her spirit now roamed the tower's empty halls, trapped in this vale of tears by her love for a fisherman named Graham. Geralt lifted the curse by bringing Graham back to see his love, but the story did not end happily. The young man's kiss dispatched the wraith into eternal slumber, but killed Graham - for, as Geralt realized all too late, Anabelle's ghost had become a deadly plague maiden, a spectral sower of disease and pestilence.<br>

   1068193|00000000||Meet me in Velen, beneath the Hanged Man's Tree. It's just a short jaunt from there to Mulbrydale.
   1068186|00000000||Count on it.
   1068195|00000000||Sorry, Roche. Rather not get involved. This is between you and Ves.
   1068197|00000000||Mhm. Hard luck. Don't let me keep you.
   1068187|00000000||Rather not get involved.
   1068128|00000000||All right, so you've got a problem - insubordination. What am I supposed to do about it?
   1068130|00000000||I doubt Ves has entered the village. More likely she and the boys lie in wait in the woods nearby. We must find her before she attacks. And stop her.
   1068136|00000000||You're a good tracker. Help me.
   1068098|00000000||What can I possibly do?
   1068138|00000000||Why Mulbrydale? Why'd Ves go there?
   1068140|00000000||The peasants from the village aided us earlier. The Nilfgaardians learned of this. Word got out they're planning a punitive expedition. Probably hang every fifth villager.
   1068142|00000000||Hm. Honestly, Ves' desire to save the villagers makes sense. What doesn't is your opposition to the plan.
   1068145|00000000||War means death. Not only of for soldiers, for common folk, as well. You can't save them all. It's that simple.

   1068133|00000000||Why'd Ves go to that village?
   1068099|00000000||Don't trust Ves anymore?

   1068110|00000000||Bollocks. She's prepared to die for me. That's not the problem.
   1068113|00000000||Know what distinguishes a soldier from a common swashbuckler?
   1068115|00000000||The uniform?
   1068117|00000000||It's a serious question.
   1068119|00000000||A rhetorical one. So instead of waiting for an answer, just… enlighten me.
   1068122|00000000||Soldiers think tactically. They know when to strike, when to fall back. When to charge and when to hold.
   1068124|00000000||Ves finds this difficult. She's impulsive, hot-tempered. Yet in guerilla warfare, one false step and you're fucked.
   1068126|00000000||I confined her to the camp because I feared that sent out, she'd go rabid and make a mistake. I was right.
   1066139|00000000||Mentioned you have a problem.
   1068091|00000000||Mhm. It's Ves. She took a couple of the lads across the river. Plans to hit the Black Ones at Mulbrydale.
   1068095|00000000||So? Sounds about like what guerilla fighters do.
   1068097|00000000||Yes, when they are ordered to. Whereas I forbade her from leaving camp. Indefinitely.
   1066137|00000000||Mentioned you have a problem.

   1054275|00000000||Thanks to the lovely Priscilla, Geralt now knew Ciri and I had struck a deal with Whoreson Junior, one of the Big Four bosses of the Novigrad underworld. It seemed a simple matter of finding Whoreson, having a chat and getting out of him where to look for me. But in the Novigrad of the time nothing was simple, and nothing was as it seemed...<br>
   1054276|00000000||Fate is like a Novigrad prostitute - sometimes you get more than you bargained for. Geralt found Whoreson after a great deal of meandering, during which he realized the man he sought was scum of the worst variety. Because of Whoreson, Ciri had been wounded, I had landed in prison, and Dudu had been subjected to torture.<br><br>It thus came as no surprise that, once he had the information he wanted, Geralt killed the heinous man without batting an eye.

Because of Whoreson, Ciri had been wounded, I had landed in prison, and Dudu had been subjected to torture.<br><br>This man surely deserved death, yet Geralt decided the greater punishment would be to let him live in shame and agony. Having achieved what he wanted and brought justice to a vile man while he was at it, he then set off to follow his new leads.

   1061668|00000000||Geralt and I had known the doppler Dudu for years - from before the moment we had actually met him, in fact.<br><br>You see, we first unwittingly talked to him when he was in Novigrad impersonating another friend of mine, a halfling merchant named Dainty Biberveldt. Dudu had assumed Dainty's form to use the merchant's network of contacts for some business endeavors of his own.<br><br>Dainty was infuriated at first at his inability to locate the impostor who had inserted himself into his dealings, but when Dudu's investments began generating sizable returns, the halfling changed his tune. He took the doppler on as a partner, introducing him to everyone as his cousin, Dudu Biberveldt.<br>
   1061669|00000000||Geralt learned that Dudu had crossed Whoreson Junior, one of Novigrad's most ruthless crime bosses. That Dudu extracted himself from this predicament while only losing one eye should be considered a fortunate turn.<br>
   1061670|00000000||Ciri, Dudu and I had all embroiled ourselves in quite the fiasco, but unlike me, the doppler was not caught by the temple guard.<br>
   1061671|00000000||Dudu was a theater aficionado and frequent attendee of Irena's mummers' performances. Apparently he had even stepped in to replace indisposed mummers on several occasions - and, given his special abilities, proved himself a uniquely convincing understudy.<br>
   1061672|00000000||Finally, after a great deal of trouble and thanks to a clever ruse, Geralt was reunited with his old friend  - and a certain imprisoned poet's only hope.<br>
   1061673|00000000||To end Dudu's story, let me just say that, as usual, he found a way to land on his feet. Dudu disguised himself as his one-time adversary, Whoreson Junior, and took over his business, announcing it was going clean and investing all its ill-gotten wealth in a legal (and very profitable) overseas trading company.<br><br>In a way, you could say he was living the "Novigrad dream."

   1060505|00000000||The devil Fugas held a position of great prestige and responsibility during the Crones' sabbath - that of goon restricting access to the peak. He in no way resembled Torque, the irritating but harmless "deovel" Geralt and I had encountered many, many years prior.<br><br>In size, Fugas resembled a somewhat overgrown troll, and he likewise displayed a troll's lack of subtlety. There was not a jot of mischievous puck or cunning verbal trickster about this "devil." Instead, he did his job with the commitment and professionalism of a Novigrad bouncer.<br><br>Trying to stop Geralt, though, turned out to be Fugas' dumbest and last idea, ending both his life and his flourishing career in the Crones' employ.

   1061156|00000000||Reverend Nathaniel, supervisor of the city morgue and cleric of the Church of the Eternal Fire, was a man with a vile character - and a stormy past. Before donning the frock he had served for years as the city torturer.<br><br>One would be hard pressed to find a more inferior candidate for a pastor than a former hangman - but, as the saying goes, in Novigrad anything is possible.<br>
   1061157|00000000||To say that Geralt caught Nathaniel red-handed would be an ill-considered pun. Nevertheless, the situation in which Geralt found him clearly indicated this was the man behind the recent wave of killings and so the witcher struck him down in a swift act of justice.<br>
   1061158|00000000||Afterwards, however, a new victim's body was found and Nathaniel's name was cleared - well, of the killings, that is, for nothing could absolve this priest of his countless other sins.
   1061159|00000000||To say Geralt caught Nathaniel red-handed would be an ill-considered pun. Yet though the situation Geralt found him in clearly proved Nathaniel was a cruel sadist, it did not prove he was a serial killer. Geralt kept a cool head and decided the priest was not the man he was after.<br>
   1061160|00000000||Before leaving, though, he made sure the degenerate would not hurt poor Nettie any more.<br>
   1061161|00000000||Nevertheless, Geralt still felt Nathaniel deserved death. At times I have thought Geralt too eager to play judge, jury and executioner - but this time, I took no issue with his actions.
   1061162|00000000||Not tarrying any further, Geralt raced off to catch the true perpetrator.

   1054999|00000000||Geralt was not able to establish whose misdeeds had drawn this spirit, but that was not what he was being paid for. With the help of the lighthouse keeper Mikkjal, he defeated the wraith, then went to collect his reward.<br>
   1055001|00000000||It turned out it was the lighthouse keeper, Mikkjal, who was at fault. Working in cahoots with pirates, he would lure ships into the rocks and loot them after they wrecked. These misdeed were what had drawn the phantom. Geralt dealt with situation as he saw fit and then went to collect his reward.<br>
   1054997|00000000||Geralt learned that the village called Arinbjorn was suffering from a wraith problem. The ghost haunted the nearby islet of Eldberg, a barren rock of no interest to anyone save for the lighthouse erected upon it. This lighthouse's light had gone out simultaneously with the phantom's appearance. This meant it had become nigh unto impossible to safely navigate a ship into Arinbjorn harbor after dark. The witcher's task was to chase off the phantom and find out what had happened to the lighthouse keeper.<br>
   1054998|00000000||While traveling across Skellige, Geralt happened upon a rocky isle covered in thick fog, from which came the screaming of wraiths. The witcher was dead set on finding out what was the matter and so bravely rushed towards the wraiths, his silver sword aloft.<br>
   1055000|00000000||It turned out the monster of Eldberg was a Penitent - a dangerous wraith which haunted particularly foul sinners.<br>

   1051833|00000000||While talking to the inhabitants of Larvik, Geralt and Yennefer found out Ciri had been in the village right before the Wild Hunt had descended upon it. She had ridden off with a man called Craven, heading towards Drowned Dead Rock. Geralt and Yennefer decided they had to find this Craven - though both knew there was little chance he would still be alive when they did. The monster dwelling in Freya's garden did not take kindly to visitors.<br>
   1051834|00000000||Geralt, an expert tracker if there ever was one, had little trouble retracing Craven's footsteps. Putting the lie to his insulting nickname, Craven had bravely faced the monster in the garden… and, sad to say, was mortally wounded as a result. Feeling the life seep out of him, Craven found shelter in an underground chamber. That is where he died, and that is where Geralt found his body. This could have marked the end of the trail, and most certainly would have, dear reader, if not for Yennefer's determination...

I'm not a bit ashamed.</i><br>– Rasmund Kvaalkje, Clan Tordarroch oarsman<br><br>This powerful, primeval monster is quite possibly the last of its race. The Ice Giant resembles a man in many respects, but is blue as frost and taller than a tree. Though it seems capable of reason, all attempts to communicate with it to date have ended in the same way – in a quick and painful death.<br>
   1077864|00000000||It is hard to provide a detailed description of the Ice Giant, for no witcher has ever faced it. It is known only from tales and second-hand reports that mix fact with legend. Skelligers claim its skin is blue because it was born of snow and ice, which is, of course, clearly impossible – though it does indeed seem capable of withstanding the fiercest frosts and in fact seems to draw strength from them. It can bind other creatures to its will, sirens in particular. It treats its victims cruelly and is particularly fond of human flesh. It uses simple weapons made from items looted from the bodies of those it has slaughtered.

   1047943|00000000||Zoltan Chivay has never had much luck in business. No exception to this rule was the time he tried to acquire and sell three valuable gwent cards. At this time gwent was reaching the peak of its popularity and collectors were paying a fool's fortune for rare cards.<br><br>Zoltan was not alone in sticking his pan into this raging torrent and hoping to strike gold. Yet there was another player in Novigrad, one wanting to grow his already-sizeable fortune, interested in flipping rare cards. Duke was his name, but many felt he would soon be known as Whoreson the Third - for he was even more ruthless than Whoreson Junior. This Duke stood in Zoltan's path to riches. Luckily, Zoltan had a friend named Geralt of Rivia who decided to step in and get him the cards he so desperately desired.<br>
   1047944|00000000||The cards were in the possession of Zed - a Novigrad fence. Geralt went to the dealer's house to buy them, but it turned out Duke had made it there before him. A brief exchange quickly turned to blows, and ended with the thugs pushing daisies. Among the splayed-out corpses was that of Zed, whom the murderers had killed earlier.<br><br>Geralt searched the body and discovered his victory was not complete - he only found the Isengrim card. Zed had sold the two remaining ones to Caesar Bilzen and a man named Ravvy. There was nothing left but to visit both purchasers and get Zoltan his cards.<br>
   1047953|00000000||Thanks some clever misdirection by Zoltan, Geralt acquired the card held by Caesar Bilzen. He also managed to get the card from Ravik. I'll spare you the details of that unfortunate incident, during which gushers of blood chased down pitchers of alcohol. Perhaps some future chronicler of the lurid and ghastly will fill you in on them. I will satisfy myself with telling you that, having acquired all three cards, Zoltan and Geralt met with their prospective buyer. This individual, it turned out, lacked something essential for the transaction to be completed - namely, his life. Standing over his stiffening corpse: Duke and his henchmen.<br>

And in a game as dangerous as that played by Duke against Geralt and Zoltan, losing meant never playing anything ever again.

The coin and cards went to Zoltan, who duly shared his winnings with Geralt.<br>
   1087094|00000000||Though Geralt had promised Zoltan help, he quickly realized he had far more important matters to tend to. This came as a great disappointment to Zoltan, true, but it's hard to blame Geralt for doing as he did: in those days, he truly did have a hearty helping of more urgent problems on his plate. Luckily Zoltan's not the type to bear a grudge, so both of them soon forgot the matter and continued on as fast friends.

Yet none of these foreign trinkets could rival the carved horn passed down to him from his ancestors for his affections.

   1087087|00000000||The residents of White Orchard had suffered more than their fair share of misfortunes. Passing armies had trampled their spring planting, a griffin had begun abducting their livestock, and, the rotten icing on this painful cake, a noonwraith haunted a nearby well. No wonder the locals called this final evil a 'devil'. The witcher could sense something bound her to this place, and that in order to send her off into the ethereal realms he would first need to learn her secret.<br><br>Once that was done, he would have to prepare for battle - and a noonwraith is a demanding opponent. She can disorient her victim by blinding him and creating mirror images of herself. These copies slowly suck their victim's life energy - while their mistress remains untouchable. In order to defeat her, the witcher could not rely on his silver sword alone - the Yrden sign would also be needed to trap her and force her to take on material form.
   1087088|00000000||<br>Witchers don't normally feel a limited range of emotions regarding the monsters they slay. They despise the particularly cruel ones and are repulsed by the disgusting ones, but rare indeed is the monster for which they feel sympathy. Yet that is exactly what Geralt felt for the noonwraith of White Orchard. For a long time he was haunted by thoughts of the young woman whose horrible death and powerful emotions had transformed her into that terrible monster.

   1051063|00000000||Geralt caught word that the villagers of Fyresdal had caught sight of a dragon. Though the witcher codex barred him from killing these noble and intelligent creatures, he decided to investigate the matter all the same.<br>
   1051064|00000000||His investigation uncovered that what the Fyresdal residents had seen was not a dragon but a forktail - a beast that, while undoubtedly dangerous, has about as much in common with a dragon as do dragonflies. Geralt tracked down the monster's nest (which it had made in an abandoned siege tower), but the forktail itself was nowhere to be found. Geralt decided that, rather than wait for the beast to return, he would lure it back home using bait.<br>
   1051065|00000000||Geralt defeated the monster and returned to collect his reward. Not wanting to take from the villagers their story about the dragon (which had already made them the envy of all the isles) Geralt decided to hide the true identity of the beast he had slain.
   1051908|00000000||Geralt defeated the monster and returned to the village to collect his reward. This turned out to be smaller than first offered - having learned that the beast was no dragon but a much less dangerous forktail, the village elder decided the witcher's honorarium should likewise be proportionately smaller. This was not the first time honesty had lightened the witcher's purse.<br>
   1051909|00000000||The village elder honored Geralt that day with the gift of a lamb - though the animal he gave was certainly not the choicest member of the flock. From what Geralt later told me, the poor creature looked like a furry water hag and had an even worse temperament.<br>

   1053399|00000000||While walking along the shore of the lake near Kaer Morhen, Geralt came across the body of a drowner. The witcher thought at first that Lambert or Eskel had killed the creature - but upon closer inspection he soon discovered there were no marks dealt by sword or Sign. It was thus clear someone - or something - else had done the drowner in. They say the enemy of one's enemy is a friend, but Geralt wanted to see who exactly this drowner-killing "friend" was.<br>
   1053408|00000000||It turned out the drowners had perished at the hands of an old rock troll who clearly did not want them as neighbors. He didn't seem fond of Geralt's presence, either - or at least, it seems safe to conclude as much, given that he tried to tear the witcher to shreds as soon as he saw him. Witchers make tougher opponents than drowners, however, and the troll was soon cut down. Geralt then uncovered a very interesting document in the troll's cave that shed new light on the Salamandra's attack on the fortress years prior.

Or, as they're called in some circles, the royal pains in the arse.</i><br>– Albina Tottelkampf, lecturer in natural sciences at Aretuza<br><br>Wyverns are often mistaken for dragons, and, though they are much smaller than their more famous kin and do not breathe fire, they are likewise extremely dangerous monsters. Especially feared are the so-called royal wyverns who, like their namesake monarchs, are exceptionally ornery and extremely deadly.<br>
   1077795|00000000||A wyvern will usually attack from the air, aiming to knock its prey down with its wings. After landing it will attack with its tooth-filled beak, trying to draw attention away from its most dangerous weapon: the stinger found at the end of its long tail. A strike from this carries the risk of poisoning from powerful toxins. Even a witcher's body experiences wrenching pain when injected with wyvern venom, and so it is worth preparing oneself with suitable potions ahead of time.

   1086970|00000000||<br>Such a monster lived near the village of Larvik on Hindarsfjall - and not even the strongest of the islanders were capable of slaying it. A witcher, though... A witcher's another story.

   1081450|00000000||Your average nekker is cowardly and weak and only ever attacks in groups, even then only when the group greatly outnumbers its opponents. Yet at times there will appear among them an individual who towers over the rest in terms of strength, stamina and cunning. Such nekkers are usually called warriors, though that name is misleading. Warriors fight with honor, face to face. These overgrown nekkers act more like assassins - they strike by surprise, from hiding, in the back, or when their opponent exposes himself while attacking. Luckily, like other nekkers warriors are vulnerable to all the Signs, and their blows can be easily parried or countered.

   1061377|00000000||Geralt and Keira's journey to the elven mage's lair had forged a tight bond between them, the kind harrowing life-or-death experiences forge between soldiers at war or students during exam week. And so when it was all over Keira invited Geralt to stop by her hut sometime, in a way that suggested she did not mean for an afternoon of tea and crumpets.<br>
   1061378|00000000||And indeed she did not - but nor did she mean what you or Geralt surely had in mind. In truth, she had a favor to ask. She wanted Geralt to help her tackle the curse afflicting Fyke Isle.
   1087303|00000000||Though lifting curses is a witcher's bread and butter, this time Geralt abandoned the job before seeing it through to fruition. I'm not entirely sure what led him to make this decision, but I can only assume his inner drive to find Ciri was so strong it would not let him spend a moment pursuing anything else.
   1087304|00000000||The curse was lifted and anyone who wished could now safely visit Fyke Isle  - yet Geralt did not return to Keira to tell her about his success. I don't know why he neglected to do so, but I am confident he had his own, perfectly valid reasons.

With these in hand, he could add life-saving improvements to his combat gear.

   1050859|00000000||Ciri's explosion of power had frightened everyone, her most of all. Clearly these uncontrolled outbursts could not be allowed to happen again, and so when the sorceresses departed for Novigrad to gather the Lodge, Ciri, Geralt and Avallac'h remained at Kaer Morhen for a few more days. The Sage hoped to teach Ciri a few tricks for controlling her power.<br>
   1051244|00000000||Sad to say, in the beginning her training was not progressing as hoped. Ciri had trouble focusing - rage and resignation would overwhelm her in turns. Geralt, the wily old wolf, knew how to deal with this. Instead of hitting her over the head with some dry motivational lecture, he decided to resort to less conventional measures and... started a snowball fight. Pure genius! And what fun! Ah, how I would have loved to have been there... But no matter, the important thing is this moment of carefree respite worked wonders on Ciri - her discouragement slackened and she returned to her training with newfound verve.<br>
   1051246|00000000||Sad to say, in the beginning her training was not progressing as hoped. Ciri had trouble focusing - rage and resignation would overwhelm her in turns. Though he desperately wanted to, Geralt did not know how to help her. The only idea that came to mind was to offer her some honest conversation over a few hearty glasses of something strong.<br>
   1051249|00000000||We had all long known Emhyr was an ingeniously ice-blooded negotiator, but this time his cold cunning plumbed new depths. While Ciri watched in horror, he offered to pay Geralt a reward for finding her, as though she were a lost goat or a runaway slave. Luckily Geralt, his hair bristling and with a low but thundering growl, told the emperor exactly where he could stick his filthy lucre.<br>
   1051250|00000000||We had all long known Emhyr was an ingeniously ice-blooded negotiator, but this time his cold cunning plumbed new depths. While Ciri watched in horror, he offered to pay Geralt his reward for finding her, as though she were a lost goat or a runaway slave. Making matters worse, Geralt displayed a complete lack of empathy and accepted the emperor's gold. Rage and a profound disappointment filled Ciri's breast - and, indeed, who could blame her?<br>
   1051247|00000000||Yet Geralt felt they needed to take care of other matters first. He had promised the emperor he would bring Ciri to see him, and intended to keep his word. Ciri and Geralt thus made a detour to Vizima.<br>
   1051254|00000000||Leaving the safety of protective walls behind them, Geralt and Ciri ventured to Bald Mountain to exact their revenge on Imlerith.<br>
   1051976|00000000||The next morning Ciri woke Geralt before dawn. She was wide-awake, a look of intense excitement on her face and urgency in her voice. What had brought her to this state? The prospect of revenge - she knew Imlerith would soon be attending a witches' sabbath on Bald Mountain. That would be their chance.<br>

    465555|00000000||Hey there! Easy!
   1061137|00000000||Even for Skelligers, who value courage above all else, Vigi's fearlessness went far beyond the pale of bravery, deep into the realm of suicidal madness. This Clan Tordarroch warrior had strived to earn the right to be called Vigi the Unfearing. Instead, his actions earned him the nickname Vigi the Loon - and it seemed this outcome suited him just fine.<br><br>It was Vigi who, craving glory and wanting to save his home isle from the Ice Giant, had convinced Hjalmar to brave the journey to Undvik. Many of their crew were killed during this expedition, and Vigi himself wound up a prisoner in the Ice Giant's cave.<br>
   1061138|00000000||Sadly, that cage became his tomb and sepulcher. When awakened the giant crushed it with one blow, putting an abrupt end to Vigi's lunacy.<br>
   1061139|00000000||The second Geralt freed Vigi from his cage, the Skelliger lived up to his moniker and awoke the sleeping giant with a hearty kick. To be fair, afterwards he fought bravely and effectively against the monster, proving he had the makings of a mighty warrior behind his madness.<br>
   1061140|00000000||That was not the last time Vigi and Geralt fought side by side. Vigi answered Geralt's call and went with Hjalmar to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Though once again he fought with skill and courage, this time he fell in battle.<br><br>News of his heroic death reached Skellige, where in ballads he has earned the title that eluded him in life: Vigi the Unfearing.<br>
   1061136|00000000||Vigi the Loon
   1051071|00000000||Driven by an atavistic need or some other reason beyond my comprehension, Geralt walked into an abandoned mine near the Inn at the Crossroads. Inside he found - and this surely will come as no surprise to you, dear, perceptive reader - monster tracks. He also came across a terrified woman who told him how a beast had devoured a group of men - and that the brother of one of the victims, a man named Bruno, would surely pay the witcher for slaying it.<br>
   1051073|00000000||In my experience, mines either hold precious metals or (more frequently) deadly monsters. The latter, in the form of arachasae, were present in great abundance in the Velen pits. Geralt knew he had to annihilate them for good - meaning he had to kill the female and destroy all the eggs she had lain.<br>
   1051074|00000000||Arachasae are incredibly dangerous beasts, but a witcher is not just some run-of-the-mill adventure seeker. In a bloody battle whose echoes could be heard throughout all of Velen, Geralt killed the old arachas queen and put an end to her vile line.
   1051913|00000000||Though Geralt had plenty of other worries, he had not forgotten about his trade - which is, let I remind you, slaying monsters. While striving to practice his profession he came across a contract offering an altogether attractive sum in return for tracking down a certain missing individual. No mention of monsters, true, but Geralt had seen enough incidents of its like to suspect one might turn up - and besides, when it comes down to it, coin is coin...<br>

   1053033|00000000||While visiting an accountant by the name of Caesar Bilzen, Geralt snitched a soldier figurine from his host's collection. While I usually deplore such acts of petty larceny as bad manners to say the least, this time it led to quite the interesting series of events, so I am prepared to let it slide. The statuette, you see, emanated magic and our witcher sensed it might be tied to something of prime importance, so he decided to show it to Triss.<br>
   1053034|00000000||The witcher's premonition was... well, if not exactly right, still worth having followed. Triss cast a decompression spell on the figurine and it transformed into a living, breathing human. To be precise, it turned into a Nilfgaardian soldier whom the sorceress Coral had transfigured in the midst of a battle many years ago. Nothing of prime importance per se, but quite interesting nonetheless.

    497399|00000000||Aye, I sold 'im. This merchant comes here from time to time. Buys narwhal horns off us. Uses them to make earrings and other such baubles for the wenches.
    497401|00000000||We were talking about the creature.
    497403|00000000||Ah, yes. This merchant - his eyes lit up soon as he saw the beast. Said a freak like that'd be the pride of any court. Proud of that - you imagine? Foreigners! I didn't wanna sell 'im. But he offered a slew of coin.

    397245|00000000||<i>Nightwraiths exude this immense sadness, this helpless wrath… I fear them, same as anyone. But most of all I feel sorry for them.</i><br>– Aelline Altsparr, elven trobairitz. <br><br>Compared to other creatures of the night – katakans, nekurats and werewolves, for example – nightwraiths (and their rarer cousins, duskwraiths) might not seem all that dangerous. After all, one might ask, how much harm could a pale, withered woman in a tattered dress do? The answer: quite a bit. Instead of finding this out the hard way, avoid crossing fields and meadows at night at all costs.<br>
   1077804|00000000||Like noonwraiths, nightwraiths are only found in rural areas. Travelers fall victim to them most often, but if legends are to be believed they also sneak into huts at times and murder peasants in their sleep. <br><br>When they attack nightwraiths remain immaterial for most of the time, meaning physical blows pass right through them. They only take on more tangible form for the brief moments in which they strike. When weakened, they will create several projections of themselves which cannot attack directly but act as transmitters of sorts through which the nightwraith can sap her victim's vital energy. <br><br>Nightwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force one to take on corporeal form, trap it with the Yrden Sign or hit it with the blast of a Moon Dust bomb.<br><br>Do not believe the old wife tales and think yourself completely safe from nightwraiths during the day. They appear under the light of the sun as well - but are much weaker then than after dusk.

   1051923|00000000||North of the Nilfgaardian camp Geralt came across tracks left by a large beast. He decided to check where, and most importantly to whom, they would lead him.<br>
   1051924|00000000||Geralt found the refugees in a cave where they had sought shelter from a monster. Such is the fate of refugees all too often - they are forever jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.

   1051086|00000000||It didn't take much for an old hand like Geralt to find out that the monster which had attacked the refugees was a wyvern. And not just any wyvern - a royal wyvern, though I doubt knowing they had come in close contact with royalty was much comfort to them.<br>
   1051093|00000000||After taking care of the beast prowling the roadside and saving the missing refugees, Geralt collected his reward from their worried comrades.
   1051922|00000000||Once upon a time, Geralt took a contract from a group of refugees. I don't know if he felt sorry for the poor souls or if his witcher blood was simply itching for some action - one way or the other, he promised to find their missing companions, who had set off with a caravan headed north.

Then this cockatrice sprung up nearby, and now all's I got left's dried patties in an empty field.</i><br>– Jethro, peasant from Pindal<br><br>Foolish superstitions claim cockatrices, like basilisks, can kill with their gaze alone. That is utter nonsense, however, a cockatrice's gaze being no more dangerous than that of an angry goose. One should instead watch out for its sharp beak and long tail, which it can whip to murderous effect.<br>
   1077782|00000000||Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements. Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor.<br><br>Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wing and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. Blows from their beaks are especially dangerous, as they aim with deadly precision at exposed flesh and vital organs and leave bleeding, life-threatening wounds. When fighting them one should make liberal use of draconid oil as well as Grapeshot, whose shrapnel will pierce their delicate wings with ease.

    571656|00000000||Oxenfurt the academy may be my alma mater, but Oxenfurt the town - that is where I received my true education. The experiences I had in its inns and alleyways often left me a trembling wreck, overwhelmed by the majesty of the world opening up before me. Sadly, during the Third Nilfgaardian War the town became a shadow of its former self, and the few who remained in its inns and alleyways risked not enlightenment but death at the hands of a mysterious murderer. Geralt, bless his heart, decided to investigate the matter, suspecting that the responsible party might be a monster...<br>
   1051967|00000000||Geralt had dealt with a great variety of beasts over the course of his career as a witcher, but an alcoholic vampire...? That was a first (well, except for maybe that one - but that was long ago). This katakan (as witchers call this manner of beast) had taken a liking to the blood of drunk men. Once Geralt figured this out, he knew exactly how to lure it out of hiding.<br>
   1051968|00000000||Geralt fought the katakan, but sadly the beast fled the first chance it got. Vampires never do make for easy foes. Geralt decided to use his Witcher Senses to hunt the monster down.<br>
   1051969|00000000||At last, success was his! Geralt tracked down and killed the katakan. The Redanian soldiers who had hired him kept their word and paid him appropriately for a job well done.

    472943|00000000||An old woman in Velen asked Geralt for an unusual favor. Some time ago her hens had gone missing from her hen house. Based on the tracks she had found, the woman suspected some two-legged creature with wolf-like paws was responsible. Geralt decided to investigate this mysterious being.<br>
   1051211|00000000||Geralt discovered the chicken thief was not a monster but a group of war orphans. Their parents caught and killed by passing soldiers, the children had been forced to fend for themselves - and Geralt was forced to choose what to do with them.<br>
   1051212|00000000||Geralt returned to the old woman who had asked him to investigate her missing poultry. He told her about the group of children he had encountered in the woods.

   1001969|00000000||Oneiromancers - or dreamers, as they are more commonly called - possess the ability their name implies to divine the future or relive the past through dreams. Corinne was one of the best of her kind and had no trouble finding clients, even with the hostility to the occult that reigned in Novigrad at the time. Geralt hoped she would spare him a few moments, and set off to find her in a house where she had gone to ply her trade.<br>
   1002007|00000000||Corinne agreed to help Geralt and put together a dreaming séance for him. Geralt has always been an introvert, and talking about his feelings and loved ones does not come easy for him. Yet that was exactly what the dreamer needed him to do if she was to dream about Ciri. In the end Geralt forced open his shell, then fell asleep - and dreamed. In his dream, he saw Ciri in Novigrad... with me.

   1083607|00000000||Eredin's last words, however, proved a lie. Avallac’h had not abducted Ciri, he was her mentor.

    588786|00000000||Not seen ye here afore…
   1072891|00000000||As commander of Temerian Special Forces - an elite squadron known also as the "Blue Stripes" - Vernon Roche had been one of King Foltest's most trusted subordinates. Time and time again Roche had proved himself loyal, effective and a thorough professional. Few could match his skill at subduing revolts, fighting off Nilfgaardians or snuffing out bands of Scoia'tael.<br><br>At the start of our story, however, he had lost his king, his men and his homeland, and so had resorted to waging a guerilla war against the overwhelming occupying forces.<br>
   1072892|00000000||In his war of assassinations, ambushes and night raids, Roche depended on Redanian help, though it was clear he took no pleasure from working with Radovid.<br>
   1072893|00000000||Some time later it was revealed that Roche had took part in a conspiracy to assassinate Radovid. He had realized that once the war was over this mad king would offer no prospect of a free Temeria, making Roche himself a liability and potential foe.<br>
   1072894|00000000||Roche took part in the assassination personally. The king of Redania's death was to be a guarantee of Temerian independence. In order to achieve this, Roche was not afraid to strike a deal with the Nilfgaardians. This move played right into Dijkstra's hand.<br><br>Geralt, refusing to get involved in their conflict, left them to work it out for themselves. As a result, Roche died on Dijkstra's orders.<br>

In order to achieve this, Roche was not afraid to strike a deal with the Nilfgaardians. This move played right into Dijkstra's hand. Fortunately, Geralt intervened and Roche escaped from the co-conspirators' meeting-turned-bloodbath.<br>
   1072908|00000000||When asked to help defend Kaer Morhen Roche kept his word and went to the keep, lending his considerable martial prowess in the fight against the Wild Hunt.

   1050850|00000000||Geralt and Ciri had no choice but to teleport away from the Isle of Mists when the Wild Hunt threatened to attack. Since Eredin could trace where Ciri traveled to with her abilities, the duo did not so much flee the Hunt as buy a few precious minutes of time. Ciri took Geralt home, to Kaer Morhen, where the group of friends the witcher had gathered waited to defend Ciri to their last breath. They spared a few seconds for a tearful reunion - then began preparations to repel the Hunt's attack.<br>
   1050851|00000000||The friends conferred and established a defense strategy. There was no time to lose. As soon as they finished, the weather changed and snow began to fall. The Wild Hunt appeared above Kaer Morhen and its spectral warriors galloped out of the sky towards the fortress.<br>
   1050854|00000000||The defenders of Kaer Morhen did what they could to hold back their attackers, but the enemy's strength was overwhelming. The Wild Hunt had made it to the very walls of Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1050855|00000000||Warrior after warrior fell to our heroes' blows, but others immediately took their place. The defenders fell back beyond the inner gates of the fortress - and so began the last phase of the battle.<br>
   1050856|00000000||It was a dark hour for the defenders of Kaer Morhen. The generals of the Hunt had entered the fray personally. Vesemir had died by Imlerith's hand, and it seemed all of the witcher's friends would soon share his fate. The defenders' lives were hanging by a thread, when suddenly Ciri's magic talent revealed its full force. In an uncontrolled outburst of rage she pummeled both allies and enemies alike with a blast of pure Power. The Hunt's forces were nearly wiped out, leaving them no choice but to retreat. Only our valiant defenders, exhausted, wounded, but still alive, remained on the field of battle.<br>
   1050857|00000000||The Battle of Kaer Morhen was over. Those who survived buried Vesemir, but had little time for mourning. The danger had only been thwarted temporarily, and they needed to prepare a new plan for saving Ciri.

   1077418|00000000||Dear Elke,<br><br>Thank the gods fools believe in them! We've made good use of that fact twice now. Firstly, when we stole that load of silver from the temple. No one was watching it - because who would be brave enough to risk the gods' wrath by desecrating such a holy place? And then we hid it all in ruins said to have been cursed by the elven gods. No one goes near there, no one even looks at them too closely - so we didn't even really have to hide it, as treasure's safer there than in the Vivaldi Bank.<br><br>We'll spend the night in the woods, then I'll ride to Novigrad, find a buyer for the whole stash. We're going to be rich, Elke, rich! And maybe then I'll throw something in the plate, a token of my gratitude to superstition and stupidity!<br><br>-Your Edgar<br>
   1077419|00000000||To this day we still don't know exactly what happened. All that is certain is neither Edgar nor Elke ever came to collect the treasure hidden in the elven ruins. A druid friend of mine to whom I told this story claimed that they must have met with divine punishment. I hope Geralt avoids a similar fate, for he helped himself to the valuables the blasphemers had gathered.
   1087009|00000000||Elven ruins are as dangerous as they are beautiful. Clear proof of this fact was given by the bodies Geralt found while exploring just such a set of decaying monuments in Velen. One of the corpses was carrying a set of notes. Intrigued, Geralt unfurled the parchment and began to read...

    552347|00000000||A Nilfgaardian patrol had gone missing near the village of Byways. Geralt took an interest in the matter, for the local Nilfgaardian commander suspected a monster was involved and Geralt knew imperial soldiers were always upfront and honest when it came to pay.<br>
   1051079|00000000||Geralt discovered that local villagers had decided to make a few extra crowns by digging in an ancient elven mine. Since the old underground complex hid its fair share of unpleasant surprises, it wasn't long before they ran into trouble. <br><br>The self-taught treasure hunters had awakened a particularly nasty kind of vampire known as an ekimmara, and this enraged beast had attacked the Nilfgaardian patrol as it passed through Byways. Geralt decided to eradicate the beast and tracked it to the ruins outside the village.<br>
   1051080|00000000||The Nilfgaardian soldiers proved themselves honorable men and paid the witcher without a murmur, handing him not only what he was owed for killing the ekimmara, but also a reward for having discovered the truth of what had happened to their missing patrol.<br>
   1051915|00000000||Geralt told the Nilfgaardian commander what had happened to the missing patrol and received his reward. The commander brought no dishonor to his uniform and paid in full, without haggling or backpedalling.<br>
   1051920|00000000||When the ekimmara had been defeated, the villagers of Byways did not prove very grateful. With long years of witchering experience under his belt, Geralt did not find this very surprising.<br>
   1051921|00000000||The villagers were grateful to the witcher for his help in slaying the ekimmara, so much so they even agreed to pay Geralt a reward.<br>
   1082243|00000000||While traveling across Velen, Geralt happened across a village which seemed to have been abandoned. The ghouls lurking amidst the huts gave him a bad feeling about its former inhabitants' fate, so the witcher decided to kill the monsters and investigate what had happened.<br>

   1089396|00000000||Gwent is an ancient dwarven card game that simulates the <<Color_Gwint>>clash of two armies<<End_Color>> in battle. The players are <<Color_Gwint>>generals<<End_Color>>, and the cards are their <<Color_Gwint>>forces<<End_Color>>.
    592837|00000000||Something about life in dreary backwoods settlements leads their inhabitants to hide the truth with misleading names. This takes the form of both hyperbole - a clump of bare trees called "Dragon Spike Forest" or a hole in the ground two paces deep named "The Chasm of Eternity" - and understatement - a horrid massacre calmly referred to as "the incident." Velen fit the mold in this regard, as Geralt learned while he wandered through it in search of Ciri. There he encountered a trio of highly suspicious magical sisters called the Ladies of the Wood, who directed him to a clump of bogside huts known as Downwarren. Geralt was to solve their "problem": a rash of mysterious murders. He spoke to the ealdorman and learned that the evil power behind the killings dwelled in the Whispering Hillock. Wherever else?<br>
    592838|00000000||The truth hidden under the Whispering Hillock? A woman's spirit, imprisoned in a cave within it. Geralt felt sympathy for the ill-treated ghost and helped it enter the body of a horse, thus regaining its freedom.<br>
    592839|00000000||The truth hidden under the Whispering Hillock? A woman's spirit, imprisoned in a cave within it. Geralt concluded this foul being was responsible for murdering the inhabitants of Downwarren, and so destroyed its heart, loosening its last grasp on our world.<br>
   1077528|00000000||While roaming the thick, gloomy tangles of the Velen woodlands, Geralt came across a spirit whose heart was trapped in a cave under an eye-catching tree…<br>

   1051248|00000000||In the backwoods of Velen Geralt came across an altar, and next to it - two troubled villagers. When asked the source of their worries, the peasants told Geralt the deity they worshipped - the awe-inspiring Allgod - had rejected the offerings they had brought him. The witcher was not a particularly gods-fearing individual, yet nevertheless promised that he'd intercede for the peasants with their deity.<br>
   1051251|00000000||It turned out the revered Allgod was a run-of-the-mill sylvan, or, as the common folk call these beings, a deovel. The conniving beast had convinced the local peasantry of its divine powers and had grown fat on their offerings for decades.<br>
   1051252|00000000||To Geralt's thinking, while the sylvan had not killed or even injured anyone, it was still a harmful parasite and thus deserved death. The witcher expected the peasants to thank him for freeing them from this horned huckster - but his rational approach to matters of faith met with incomprehension and horror.<br>
   1051253|00000000||Geralt convinced the sylvan demanding outrageously sumptuous offerings in a time of poverty and famine was immoral and unbecoming, even for a false god. The sylvan seemed skeptical at first, but after eyeing the silver sword on Geralt's back he decided he'd best not argue.<br>
   1051255|00000000||The witcher's argument that demanding outrageously sumptuous offerings in a time of poverty and famine was immoral and unbecoming of even a false god did not convince the sylvan. Geralt decided he was not going to toss his pearls before this particular swine anymore and bid the Allgod farewell before continuing on his path.<br>

    492511|00000000||I would wager anyone that you, dear reader, are a person of culture and taste – and therefore already familiar with me, Dandelion, and the role I am to play in the following tale. Nevertheless, allow me to sketch a few lines by way of self-portrait, for the sake of thoroughness, and in the event you have spent much of the last half-century in some dark corner where the light of my star has yet to reach.<br><br>"Born in 1229, a talented poet and troubadour, a graduate of Oxenfurt Academy, a frequent performer at royal courts, an unequaled lover appreciated, and in some cases adored, by ladies worldwide, a skilled negotiator and a stirring orator" – such is the image of the bard Dandelion as painted by his friends and promoters.<br><br>This image is, of course, somewhat overbright in its coloring – I personally prefer to think of myself as a dedicated artist in thrall to his Muse, one whose work has benefited immeasurably from the fact that I was, am and forever will remain a close friend and steadfast companion to the witcher Geralt. It is his fate I chronicle in this present work and his story which I shall sing till the end of my days.<br>
    492594|00000000||Having learned of my disappearance, Geralt dropped everything to find out what had become of me. Though at first he suspected the cause of my trouble lay in my many and turbulent affairs of the heart, he later determined that I had strayed into a life of crime, seeking to steal treasure belonging to one of the leaders of Novigrad's underworld.<br>
   1060546|00000000||The motivations for my actions only became clear some time later. I proved that, when it comes to helping Cirilla, I would not balk at sticking my head into the lion's maw, let alone crossing such common scum as Cyprian Wiley, better known (for good reason!) as Whoreson.<br>
   1060547|00000000||Only a madman calls it courage to fight when faced with overwhelming odds. Though known for my capricious and unpredictable charm, I am not yet considered mad, and so, while defending my companion's escape to the very last, I ultimately allowed the temple guard to take me to their prison, where I awaited my imminent execution.<br>
   1060548|00000000||The saying does not lie - "true friends show when fortune hides her face." My dear comrades gave ample evidence of this by breaking me free from my prison transport, saving me from certain and painful death.<br>

   1084653|ea54b6d5||Rabid rock troll
   1062504|00000000||The witcher first met the raven-haired sorceress a good twenty years back. Their friendship and the feelings between them were born of a common adventure involving a genie and a wish granted to Geralt that intertwined their fates inextricably.<br><br>In the time since then their relationship had, however, been quite stormy - rich in ups and downs, crises and break-ups. Geralt and Yennefer’s love provides irrefutable proof of the thesis that "opposites attract." <br><br>A few years ago Geralt and Yennefer had, after a long separation full of adventures for them both, gotten back together again. Their moment of repose was interrupted by the Wild Hunt, which took Yennefer captive. The witcher set out at once to save her, but lost his memory while doing so. When he finally recovered it, he immediately set off once more on his quest to find his beloved sorceress.<br>
   1062505|00000000||The circumstances of Geralt’s initial reunion with Yennefer after two years were quite different than he had imagined. The sorceress was not only safe and sound, but had even secured the aid of an unexpected and mighty ally - the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br>
   1062506|00000000||Geralt's relationship with Triss during Yennefer's absence had clearly cast a cloud over their reunion. If the witcher wanted to win back his one-time love, he would need to take bolder steps than relying on his memory loss as an excuse - one which, while valid, did little to repair the damage.<br>
   1062507|00000000||A thick air of repressed hostility reigned during Geralt’s time with Yennefer in Skellige. More than once the sorceress sharply expressed her displeasure, sparing no cutting remark - just like during the best years of their relationship. In the end, however, the witcher's patience was rewarded, and their expedition to retrieve the mask of Uroboros brought the former lovers back together.<br><br>The gulf that had arisen between them during their time of separation seemed that much narrower.<br>
   1062510|00000000||In order to obtain the information they needed Yennefer did not hesitate to resort to necromancy, and destroyed the goddess Freya's garden while doing so. If the proud sorceress felt any guilt as a result, as usual she showed no sign of it.<br>
   1062511|00000000||The idea of hunting another genie together did not at first arouse Geralt's enthusiasm, but Yennefer had a truly valid reason for wanting it. If she succeeded in forcing the genie to take back the wish binding her to the witcher, she would finally know if the feelings between them were truly love or merely magic.<br>
   1062512|00000000||The genie granted Yennefer's request and broke the thread of destiny binding her to Geralt. Luckily it turned out their love could continue - without the need for supernatural assistance.<br>
   1062513|00000000||The genie granted Yennefer's request and that special magic between Geralt and Yennefer disappeared forever, leaving behind only regret, emptiness and a feeling of loss. Sadly, it is true what they say: "be careful what you wish for."<br>
   1062516|00000000||Though the sorceress' difficult character had made life miserable for everyone at Kaer Morhen, in the end it was her stubborn determination that led to Uma's disenchantment and the lifting of Avallac'h's curse.<br>
   1062518|00000000||Yennefer had always felt some ends justified otherwise unsavory means. When it became clear rescuing Ciri would require the help of Philippa Eilhart and the other sorceresses of the reviled Lodge, she forgot about any bad blood and convinced Emhyr to grant them amnesty.<br>
   1062520|00000000||One need not be particular skilled in reading human character to have guessed that toying with Yennefer's feelings would bring retribution. Likewise even Geralt should have known that his attempts to keep a foot in both camps with her and Triss would end badly for him. Considering the raven-haired sorceress' explosive temperament, the humiliating punishment he met was unusually lenient.<br>

    397244|00000000||<i>An alghoul's basically a badarse ghoul</i><br>– Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior<br><br>Alghouls differ from normal ghouls in size, strength, coloring and, most importantly, intelligence. Whereas ghouls and graveirs are primitive creatures unfit to plan even the simplest ambush, alghouls and their kindred (such as cemetaurs) are capable of forethought, and are thus much more dangerous.<br>
   1077291|00000000||Ghouls seem to possess wits enough to at least know a brighter mind when they see it, and so let alghouls and cemetaurs lead their packs. A pack so led will terrorize all in its path, attacking not only lone travelers but also caravans and even farmsteads. When encountering such a pack the alghoul should be eliminated as a first priority, leaving the other beasts for once their leader is gone. One be particularly careful when fighting alghouls around dusk and at night, when they fight with doubled strength.<br><br>During combat alghouls and cemetaurs try risky maneuvers aimed at knocking their opponents to the ground so the others can finish the job by tearing them to shreds. Like a normal ghoul, an injured alghoul can fall into a frenzy and attack with blind fury. An experienced witcher knows to get out of its way on such occasions and strike from behind, while for an inexperienced witcher, such a turn of events often marks the end of his Path.

    568253|00000000||During a conversation with a certain guardsman, Geralt learned that members of the city watch had been disappearing under murky circumstances. He accepted the task of looking into the matter.<br>
   1051956|00000000||Geralt spied something on the city notice board that intrigued him. It seemed keeping the peace in Novigrad was not the city guard's only problem.<br>
   1051957|00000000||The clues Geralt found led him to a house of ill-repute. As is often the case in such establishments, more than lovemaking was taking place within its walls...<br>
   1051958|00000000||Geralt's investigation revealed a succubus had been responsible for the city guardsmen's murder. I've dealt with more than one such creature in my life and I must say, if anyone is under the misconception that encounters with these creatures are pleasant - well, I would disabuse him of it myself, but I know that is a task only unfortunate experience can accomplish. Suffice it to say death from a surfeit of pleasure leaves one no less dead.<br>
   1051959|00000000||After talking to the succubus, Geralt decided to spare its life. When he told me this, I was at first outraged, but then he explained the arguments the succubus had given him and convinced me the guards she had killed had earned their fate.<br>
   1051960|00000000||Geralt tracked down the succubus. They had a brief conversation, during which the succubus tried to justify herself by providing motives for her murders. Geralt remained unmoved and the succubus met with due punishment for her crimes.<br>

Deprived of consciousness or independent will, this elemental is boundlessly obedient to the orders of the mage who created it. Those orders usually contain but one syllable: kill.<br>
   1077695|00000000||Ice elementals have no qualms about carrying out this order nor any particular difficulty in doing so. Gifted with incredible strength, they are completely invulnerable to poison and fire, deprived of sensitive organs, hard as permafrost and all in all incredibly difficult opponents.

   1053409|00000000||An observation tower located on a hillside near Kaer Morhen caught Geralt's eye. Though the structure had been there for as long as he could remember, this was the first time in ages he had bothered to inspect it more closely. When he did, he discovered a whole heap of wraiths had taken up residence within. I've said it before and I'll say it again - witchers make horrible housekeepers.<br>
   1053410|00000000||Geralt was able to deduce from the evidence at hand that the fortress was haunted by the ghost of a boy who had once trained to be a witcher. His monster slaying career had been tragically nipped in the bud when enraged fanatics attacked Kaer Morhen. <br><br>Geralt found and buried the poor lad's remains, and along with them two swords, one of silver, the other of steel. He hoped this would give the boy's tortured soul some peace and allow him to depart from the old bastion.

   1027733|00000000||Advising, at best… Boy never managed to forge the blade, but would never let me at the anvil. Just pestered me with questions. Wanted to do it all by himself, as always. But then the whole plan went to the devil. Literally!
   1027734|00000000||What do you mean?
   1027735|00000000||Berengar set out to hunt a chort. Fiend had made its lair in the valley past the keep. Don't know why, but he took all his equipment with him… Maybe thought I'd tinker with the sword while he was gone? You know what he was like.
   1043847|00000000||At any rate, the chort turned out to be strong. Too strong. Berengar had to turn tail. And since it's hard to run with four stones of kit under your arm, he dropped it all. Came back red with blood… and shame. Hardly said a word, and left soon after. Never to return.
   1027736|00000000||I know the rest of the story… How do I get to this chort's lair?
   1027737|00000000||Knew you'd want to finish this… Easiest way's to take the river downstream as far as you can go. But be careful. Berengar had his flaws, but he was a damn good fighter. If that chort's still there, you could be in for a wild ride.

Yet when I open my mouth to sing the praises of Priscilla, I find - hard as this might be to conceive - that my throat constricts, words turn to meal in my mouth, and all elaborate turns of speech seem artificial and empty when compared to the natural beauty, talent, sensitivity and intellect nature has bestowed her.<br><br>Priscilla (or Callonetta, the stage name under which she gained artistic renown) was, around the time of our story's beginning, enjoying the last stop on a triumphal tour of concerts that had taken her from the sumptuous courts of Lan Exeter and Pont Vanis, through Tretogor and Caelf, finally bringing her to the glorious city of Novigrad.<br>

Young Hjalmar took after his father in both posture and character, and many predicted that in time he would overtake his elder in the honor and fame he would gain.<br><br>An extremely able, broad-shouldered swordsman, he had the makings of a superb warrior, and his charisma and tendency towards almost mad bravura meant he could stir the hearts of loot- and glory-craving youth from all Skellige's clans.<br>
   1060726|00000000||All these traits made Hjalmar an obvious choice for the next king of Skellige. He thus did not hesitate to stake his claim when the time for this arrived and immediately set off for Undvik to prove his heroism by battling the legendary Ice Giant.<br>
   1060727|00000000||Hjalmar accomplished what he set out to do. Fighting side by side with the witcher he defeated the fierce colossus of Undvik.<br>
   1060728|00000000||Though his sister was chosen to be ruler instead of him, Hjalmar did not bear a grudge and decided to lend her reign all his strength, an act that showed surprising political maturity.<br>
   1060729|00000000||Young an Craite proved his valor when he and the witcher avenged the guests murdered during the infamous "Bloody Banquet" at Kaer Trolde. By this deed he also cleared his family name of all dishonor.<br>
   1060730|00000000||All these feats convinced Skelligers that Hjalmar was fit to be king. Though it was clear it would take some time before the young ruler could step entirely out of his father's shadow, most islanders were pleased and proud with their choice of ruler.<br>
   1060732|00000000||When discussing Hjalmar's heroic deeds it surely must be mentioned that he did not hesitate to support Geralt by answering his call and defending Ciri at Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1060733|00000000||Hjalmar's hot temper turned out to be his doom in the end. Young an Craite died alongside his sister while leading one of the first attacks on the Nilfgaardian fleet.<br>

Yet some individuals grow bold over the years and begin sneaking into huts to steal children and kill the elderly. Just such a monster was tormenting the inhabitants of Lindenvale.<br><br>The witcher knew this grave hag would put up a fierce fight. He would have to watch out for her powerful claws, capable of smashing through any block or parry, and her long, venomous tongue. He also realized her attacks would be so quick not even his mutated reflexes would be able to keep pace - meaning only judicious use of the Yrden Sign would all him to survive and conquer.

   1050852|00000000||When Geralt entered the Novigrad bathhouse, he happened to walk in on a meeting of the heads of the city's criminal underworld. Becoming an unwitting participant in their conversation, he learned of the conflict between the triumvirate made up of the King of Beggars, Sigi Reuven and Carlo "Cleaver" Varese on the one hand, and Whoreson Junior and the unknown powers backing him on the other. Cleaver in particular wanted Whoreson gone and offered Geralt help in finding and gettin to the bastard, which suited Geralt's interests. They say hands aplenty make for light work, and Geralt had every reason to believe this applied to gang warfare as much as it did to cleaning a barn, so he graciously accepted the gangster's offer.<br>
   1050853|00000000||Geralt did not find Whoreson during his search with Cleaver's men, but do not think his time was wasted. The witcher smashed his way through a fair number of public mingling spaces and slaughtered a great many armed men of diverse social backgrounds, gaining in the doing a unique look at the complications of daily life in the Novigrad underworld. Enriched with this knowledge, Geralt continued his search for Whoreson alone.

   1051292|00000000||Yennefer asked - or rather, if I am to be completely honest with you, dear reader, ordered - Geralt to help Eskel hunt a forktail. The sorceress needed ingredients from this dangerous beast's body and clearly thought two witchers would get the job done sooner than one. Geralt thus set out to track the monster - but first, he had to find Eskel.<br>
   1051293|00000000||In the end, the hunters bagged their prey. Using their traditional and, while we're being honest, rather unrefined methods, the two witchers first lured the forktail close, then wounded the beast and gave chase as it fled, finally finishing it off in its lair. And so they acquired the ingredients Yennefer needed and, no less important, had a bit of time to catch up - Eskel and Geralt had not seen each other in years.

The doppler had proved a reasonable creature deprived of the true Chappelle's cruelty, and under his watch life in the city had much improved.<br><br>Sadly, the chancellor's conciliatory style must have raised suspicions as a wave of terror and persecution began to swell over Novigrad. The doppler was found out, arrested and burned at the stake for the greater glory of the Eternal Fire.

   1049711|00000000||Finding Ciri in Velen had proven harder than tracking a swallow on a rainy day. According to Keira, an elven mage had been tracking this particular swallow as well. Had he found her? Did he know more about her fate? Geralt knew he had to find out, and Keira, well, she had unfinished business of her own with the mage. And so the witcher and sorceress set out together on a journey into the darkness to find the mysterious elf's underground hideout.<br>
   1049712|00000000||Barely had our heroes entered the underground chambers when they encountered the enemy. The Wild Hunt had reached the spot before them - and they, too, were searching for Ciri.<br>
   1049713|00000000||The Hunt had in its ranks a navigator, a powerful mage able to teleport its warriors from place to place in the blink of an eye. Geralt and Keira, on the other hand, made their way slowly on foot, encountering obstacle after obstacle. All might have been lost had our heroes not happened across a morphotic projection the elven mage had left for Ciri. The mage's illusion guided her towards his lair and called her "Zireael" - meaning "swallow" in Elder Speech. Hearing this, Geralt gained two vital clues: the mage clearly knew Ciri well, and he must have painted the swallows on the walls to direct her.<br>
   1049714|00000000||The road through the underground was not an easy one to travel. The mage had set a great many traps that Ciri could easily evade but which would trip up any who chased after her.<br>
   1049715|00000000||In the end Geralt and Keira eliminated the Wild Hunt's lead and began nipping at its heels.<br>
   1049716|00000000||Ciri's pursuers did not find what they were looking for. They departed empty-handed, leaving one warrior behind to tend to Geralt and Keira. He proved a weak match for the witcher and the sorceress, but their victory was bittersweet, as in the underground passageways Geralt found neither Ciri nor the elven mage. All he could now do was to follow the hints provided by yet another morphotic projection the mage had left behind.
   1049717|00000000||Geralt finally learned the truth about Ciri and the witch from the mouth of an illusion. The mage's projection corrected and supplemented the information left behind by Hendrik - Ciri's opponent had not been one ordinary witch but the three Crones, mysterious and powerful beings dwelling in Crookback Bog. Who they truly were and what had happened to Ciri at their swampy home - that, dear reader, you will learn in the pages that follow.

   1086964|00000000||<br> This vengeful wraith might very well have killed every last inhabitant of the village, had not a famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia, appeared in Velen - and been in need of a bit of coin.
   1087370|00000000||<i>So... That's to mean... our Zula's the wraith?</i><br>– Bolko, ealdorman of Midcopse<br>
   1081319|00000000||It is said true love's flame is never extinguished. This sad truth is the reason why Zula of Midcopse, whom an early death had separated from her beloved, was unable to find peace in the next life, and instead returned to haunt her former environs as a nightwraith.<br><br>Fighting such an apparition is extremely difficult. A nightwraith will form mirror images of herself to confuse her opponent and aid her in battle. She herself can take on immaterial form, rendering her invulnerable to blows. The best way to force her out of this state is to set a trap with the Yrden Sign, then quickly follow up with Igni while she is caught. Most important of all, however, is this: never attempt to fight one in the middle of the night, when the moon hangs high in the sky.

   1060995|00000000||It is my humble opinion that the most one can learn from staring at the innards of a gutted animal is whether the poor beast was infested with parasites. Nevertheless, Hjort, like many other druids of Skellige, placed a great deal of trust in both haruspicy and chiromancy (and oneiromancy as well, though that's more understandable, dreams being the royal route to one's soul).<br><br>Word was that he commanded a great deal of respect and esteem amongst his fellow practitioners, having more than once accurately prophesied the future and interpreted the meaning of obtuse dreams. This druid was devoted to Clan Brokvar with all his heart, and his knowledge and ability made him an excellent advisor, one in whom the jarl of Spikeroog, Udalryk of Clan Brokvar, placed a great deal of trust.<br>

   1059050|00000000||Oneiromancy, the magic art of deciphering the past and the future as they appear in dreams, is difficult for even a highly trained sorceress to master. Those born with the talent, however, excel at it without any formal education. Such was the case of Corinne Tilly, whose fame as a dreamer, as such diviners are known, had spread far and wide.<br>
   1059051|00000000||This gifted woman could not only dream of past events herself, but also induce revelatory dreams in persons searching for direction or answers to specific questions. These abilities proved to be of great use to Geralt in his search.<br>

   1050766|00000000||The commander of the Nilfgaardian garrison in White Orchard knew where Yennefer had gone. Shrewdly, he was unwilling to share this information for free. A man with substantial experience, he knew full well Geralt would do anything to find the sorceress. As luck would have it, there was a griffin about, a beast the commander's soldiers had been unable to hunt down. The commander could demand but one thing: the monster's head in exchange for his help.<br>
   1050767|00000000||The witcher investigated and learned that the griffin he had encountered along the high road outside of White Orchard had good reason to prey on the local populace. The soldiers the Nilfgaardian commander had sent out to scout had, in fact, killed the griffin's brooding mate. Griffins are known to mate for life, and Geralt thus felt a pang of pity for the beast. But, ever the professional, he could not let his feelings interfere with his work.<br>
   1050771|00000000||Once it came to ambushing the feathery widower, Geralt turned to Vesemir for help. With two witchers lunging at its throat, the griffin of White Orchard proved a lamb for the slaughter. As is the way of his order, Geralt took the beast's head as his trophy and delivered it to the Nilfgaardian garrison for his reward, which, as you might remember, was to be information about Yennefer.

The one-time lovers could not enjoy their reunion, for the sorceress had insisted they make haste.<br><br>Geralt and Yennefer had then left White Orchard accompanied by the Nilfgaardians, but only the witcher and the sorceress reached Vizima. Along the way their column was attacked by a cavalcade of wraiths: the omen of war - the Wild Hunt.<br><br>Geralt's head was abuzz with questions. What had Yen gotten into? How had the Hunt found them? Why was it looking for them? Why had he been summoned to Vizima? He was to get his answers from none other than the Emperor of Nilfgaard himself, Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. The most powerful man in the known world.<br>
   1051006|00000000||Short though it was, Geralt's audience with Emhyr proved substantial. The emperor's daughter and Geralt's erstwhile ward and friend, Cirilla, had returned from… a faraway land. She was in danger, her life was threatened - the Wild Hunt was pursuing her. Emhyr knew he had to find his long-unseen progeny before the wraiths did. First he had sought Yennefer's help. Yet they soon discovered that the sorceress' locating spells attracted the Hunt's attention. It was clear - they had to find Ciri without resorting to magic, employing only conventional means. Few men are better trackers than my old friend Geralt of Rivia, so Emhyr promised him a mountain of gold in exchange for his help. Yet Geralt accepted the task willingly - for personal, not material, reasons. This I know for certain, because of all the people in the world, Ciri was dearest to Geralt. He would do anything to save her.

   1061400|00000000||As an attentive reader you surely remember that the Wild Hunt could only be defeated with the help of powerful magic, and for this reason Geralt had recruited the most powerful sorceresses in the world, both those he liked and those he utterly detested, to join his cause. When a chance arose to add Fringilla Vigo to the roster, Geralt seized it without a moment's hesitation and went straightaway to the emperor's ship, where the dark-haired sorceress was being held.<br>
   1073609|00000000||Fringilla Vigo was the emperor's prisoner, and probably would have remained so till the end of her days if not for Yennefer's pact with Emhyr. He agreed to let the sorceress go - on condition she help in the fight against the Wild Hunt.<br>

   1038361|00000000||Near the Nilfgaardian camp Geralt ran into a noblewoman from far-off Nazair. She had journeyed to the front in search of her son, a soldier. The woman was worried because her son would write her often, but at some point had suddenly stopped. No one in the camp knew what had happened to him, but the woman did not believe they were truly ignorant. She offered Geralt a reward for discovering the truth.<br>
   1038580|00000000||It turned out the noblewoman's son had decided to desert along with some other disgruntled soldiers. A search party had immediately been sent after them. Some were caught and killed, while others managed to escape. Sadly, the woman's son was among those hanged. When she learned this, she was overcome with grief. The letter Geralt had found on her son's body informed her how monstrous war can be and how hard it is to judge the actions of the soldiers taking part in it.

   1058845|00000000||Geralt encountered this young woman's ghost in the uppermost room in the haunted tower on Fyke Isle. She told him that in life she had been the local lord's daughter.<br><br>When enraged peasants stormed the tower, she feared they would ravage her honor if they found her alive and so took a magic potion that put her in a corpse-like state of paralysis. When she awoke, she found herself lying amidst the bodies of her family and servants, unable to move. She watched in helpless horror as rats feasted on the pile of corpses and began to nibble on her as well.<br><br>This grisly death must have somehow put a curse on her and the tower, for her ghost had wandered it in restless torment ever since. Geralt engaged his vast experience with such curses to search for a possible solution. Having learned that Anabelle had loved a simple fisherman named Graham, Geralt decided this man and the bond of true love the two youths shared could be their salvation.<br>
   1058846|00000000||Geralt agreed to take the young woman's remains to her love to have him give her a proper burial. Geralt hoped this would lift the evil spell on the cursed isle and bring Anabelle peace at long last.<br>
   1058847|00000000||Sadly, what Geralt took to be the ghost of an innocent woman was in fact death and disease in spirit form - a being known as a pesta, or plague maiden. Having lured Geralt into the open, it killed the unfortunate Graham and then escaped to spread the pox and feed on human suffering.<br><br>It is possible that this incident caused the local outbreak of Catriona that devastated the kingdom of Kerack and sowed the seeds of the coastal city's ultimate downfall.<br>
   1058848|00000000||Yet when Geralt tried to leave the tower, the wraith revealed its true nature. It turned out what Geralt took to be the ghost of an innocent girl was in fact a plague maiden - death and disease in spirit form.<br>
   1058849|00000000||Perhaps there was something in the girl's words that had put Geralt on his guard, or perhaps his witcher instincts simply warned him in time - either way, Geralt knew what he was dealing with a literal second before Anabelle revealed her true nature. The spirit was in fact a pesta - a plague maiden, a terrible wraith which spreads death and pestilence.<br>

   1044119|00000000||Geralt's search for the baron's wife and daughter took him to the local pellar, a sort of soothsayer and folk mage whom Geralt rightly suspected would be well informed about all local goings-on.<br><br>The pellar shared some juicy gossip with Geralt: supposedly the baron was a drunk and a terror to his family, and his wife's recent pregnancy had ended in a mysterious miscarriage.<br><br>The pellar's augurs showed that the miscarried fetus, undoubtedly discarded without a proper burial, had transformed into a dangerous monster: a botchling. The beast was murderous and foul, but could yet do some good. If its curse could be lifted and the monster could be turned into a lubberkin, this latter being, a friendly household guardian, could lead Geralt to the baron's wife and daughter.<br>
   1044126|00000000||Geralt's bosom boiled with wrath as he went to confront the baron. He was ready to drag the truth out of the man with a sword, force him to confess to what had truly happened that fateful night. A witcher in this state is even more effective than usual, so Geralt accomplished this in short order. The baron admitted that his wife had miscarried after one of their frequent rows, and that she and his daughter had fled Crow's Perch. He also agreed to show Geralt where he had buried the miscarried child's remains. When the clock struck midnight, both men set off to find the botchling's grave.<br>
   1044129|00000000||Once Geralt and the baron had reached the unborn babe's place of burial, they did not have to wait long for the botchling to show up. The beast hissed and howled and threatened to assume its more monstrous and vicious form, but the two men completed the naming ritual before it could. Then, following ancient custom, they buried the creature under the threshold so that in time it might be reborn as a lubberkin, a household guardian spirit. Geralt hoped this being would help him find the baron's family.<br>
   1044130|00000000||Once Geralt and the baron had reached the babe's place of burial, they did not have to wait long for the botchling to show up. When it did, the monster slayer slew the monster and collected some of its blood - this time not as a trophy but for use in an ancient ritual that, the witcher hoped, would provide him with more information about the fate of the baron's wife and daughter.<br>
   1044131|00000000||The baron's wife and daughter had not fled Crow's Perch's unaided - a fisherman living nearby had provided key assistance. Geralt went to the man's hut, where he learned a fiend had attacked the two women during their flight. The beast had torn Anna's horse to shreds, then carried her off into the woods.<br><br>One detail the fisherman mentioned rankled in the witcher's mind: it seemed Anna's hands bore strange marks that had burned with fire just moments before the fiend appeared. What could have caused them? What did they mean?<br><br>Geralt would have to endure this rankling until he found Anna, who, if still alive, had to be somewhere in Crookback Bog. Tamara, on the other hand, had made it to Oxenfurt, where the fisherman had helped her find shelter with his brother.<br>
   1044142|00000000||Upon hearing this, the baron revealed another scrap of information about Ciri. He told Geralt of a certain afternoon when he and his retinue had decided to celebrate a successful hunt with a bit of horse racing. The race had come to an abrupt halt, however, when a basilisk attacked. Here the baron employed an old storyteller's trick, breaking his tale off at a crucial moment and announcing he would not utter another word until Geralt found his wife.<br>
   1044143|00000000||Finding the baron's wife had proven far from simple, and the witcher, for neither the first nor the last time, only succeeded thanks to a chance discovery. While he was asking the Crones of Crookback Bog about Ciri, he noticed the old woman who served them bore unmistakable marks on her hands - the same burning symbols Anna had worn in the fisherman's tale. There was no room for doubt: this had to be her.<br>
   1044144|00000000||At long last, after Geralt had fulfilled his part of the bargain and found the baron's wife and daughter, the lord of Crow's Perch relieved the suspense and finished his tale. He recounted how Ciri had been forced to use her powers to save the baron's life. This had drawn the Wild Hunt's attention, so Ciri had had no choice but to flee once more - this time to the Free City of Novigrad. Geralt's search in Velen was at an end.
   1044108|00000000||The baron turned out to be a tough negotiator who knew the full value of the information he possessed. He agreed to tell Geralt about Ciri on one condition: Geralt had to find his wife and daughter first. The women had mysteriously disappeared a short time before. Though the baron had moved heaven and earth to find them, all his efforts had proved fruitless.<br>

   1077290|00000000||Ghouls and their more dangerous cousins, graveirs, usually feed in small groups, at times led by an alghoul. Since they delight most in the taste of fresh carcasses, they appear wherever newly-dug graves are to be found: cemeteries, crypts, catacombs and battlefields. Whenever the opportunity arises they hunt the living as well, especially when they have strength in numbers.<br><br>In a one-on-one fight with a trained witcher, a ghoul poses little threat, but one must remember that wounded individuals can erupt in a mad frenzy. At such times they attack fiercely, paying no heed to their own safety and brushing off all wounds. One must likewise bear in mind that ghouls and graveirs are particular dangerous around dusk and at night.

In part, they resemble humans - yet on the whole, they are the utter negation of all that is human. Though they have arms and legs like men, they walk on all fours like dogs or badgers.

They are driven by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable craving for human flesh.<br>

   1086957|00000000||<br> The witcher arrived at the cave too late to save the refugees - but he could still avenge their fate. He slew the powerful arachas and destroyed the eggs bearing its vile offspring.

   1081323|00000000||Velen's woods and bogs brim with monsters. This fact is well known, and thus when the war drove refugees into this hostile land, certain of their number thought to avoid the dangers of the lowlands by hiding in an abandoned mine. They were in for an unfortunate surprise. The shaft they chose for their sanctuary was inhabited by a poisonous arachas - a merciless and bloodthirsty monster.<br><br>The witcher knew he was in for a tough fight. The arachas had dwelled in the mine for years and had grown large and particularly strong and resilient in that time. Like other members of its vile species, it would be dangerous both at close quarters and at a distance. What's more, it was almost certainly venomous - he would need to imbibe Swallow or Golden Oriole (or both) before attacking if he was to stand a chance of surviving. As a small consolation, the witcher knew the monster would be vulnerable to his Signs - especially Igni, Aard and Yrden - as well as to the Northern Wind bomb.

   1058709|00000000||During his first encounter with "Baron" Phillip Strenger, Geralt found the man's many contradictions puzzling. This former Temerian soldier was clearly an opportunist who, after his army's resounding defeat, served, dealt and negotiated with the occupying Empire of Nilfgaard. The local peasantry anointed him the "Bloody Baron," a clear indication that he did not handle his vassals with kid gloves. On the other hand, he proved a surprisingly gracious host to an unexpected guest who was also a stranger and a hired monster slayer.<br>
   1058710|00000000||His treatment of children and young women, towards whom he demonstrated a wholly sincere, near fatherly-concern, likewise contradicted his bandit-like appearance and terrifying moniker. Ciri had learned this for herself, finding care and shelter under his roof.<br>
   1058711|00000000||In exchange for information about Cirilla, the baron asked Geralt to find his wife, Anna, and their daughter Tamara. Both had disappeared without a trace some time ago, and Phillip was slowly losing hope of ever seeing them again. Under these circumstances, a witcher was a gift from the gods.<br>
   1058712|00000000||Yet the baron had hid certain facts from Geralt, such as his wife's recent pregnancy, her subsequent miscarriage and his own predilection towards strong drink and violent quarrels.<br>
   1058722|00000000||It turned out the baron would drink regularly and to excess, and Geralt got a first-hand view of how dangerous he can be to those around him during such moments when he returned to talk to the baron about what he had learned from the Pellar. Phillip had known from the start that his wife and daughter had fled, not disappeared, but, torn between shame and concern over their fate, he had tried to save face while still doing all he could to find them.<br>
   1058723|00000000||On this subject there was no denying his determination. Paying no heed to the fact that a confrontation with the Crones might end tragically for him, he decided to ride into the swamps and try to free Anna from their clutches.<br>
   1058724|00000000||They say a man's true nature is revealed in times of crisis. The baron's reunion with his wife was certainly such a time - her deplorable state shook Phillip to the core. Yet when he learned there was a sliver of hope that Anna could be cured of her madness, the baron seized that thought with all his strength and decided to ride with his wife to the very end of the known world, to the Blue Mountains, and seek help for her tortured mind there.<br>
   1058731|00000000||Despite the combined efforts of the baron, his men and Geralt, Anna could not be saved. Alas, this was not the end of the bad news - Tamara, who had also ventured into the swamp to save her mother, made it painfully clear to the baron that she no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. Having lost on all fronts and without uttering a single word, he trekked back to Crow Perch alone...<br>
   1058737|00000000||Despite the combined efforts of the baron, his men, Geralt and Tamara, who had come for her mother with an escort of witch hunters in tow, Anna could not be saved. The Crones had outwitted them all - they had crafted the curse so that lifting it would lead to Anna's death. The baron was completely shattered by this turn of events. Turning his back on them all, he trekked back to Crow Perch alone...<br>
   1058738|00000000||Not long afterwards Geralt learned that Phillip Strenger, the one-time terror of all of Velen, had hanged himself out of grief and despair, desolated by the loss of all that he had loved in his lifetime.

   1053397|00000000||It turned out even the area around Kaer Morhen, a place which - one would think - Geralt knows by heart, can hide a great many interesting and undiscovered phenomena. Not far from the keep, Geralt came across an area where the weather differed remarkably from that of its surroundings. He decided to investigate what sort of forces were at work.<br>
   1053398|00000000||After a brief investigation, the witcher was able to conclude that the weather anomaly was the doing of one of the resident mages of Kaer Morhen, who had created a sort of outdoor greenhouse in which to cultivate the herbs used for the Trial of the Grasses. Though you might not know this, Geralt is quite the handyman, something which came in handy (pun unintended) at this time. He banged and nudged the broken magical apparatus and returned it to working order in no time. Before long, rare herbs were growing outside Kaer Morhen once again.

    533003|00000000||Learned some things. It's a male, had its nest in the Vulpine Woods.
    565109|00000000||The Nilfgaardians burned the woods down, killed its mate, smashed their eggs - thought they'd fixed things.
    565111|00000000||Hm. It's always the same. Instead of sending for a professional, they try to do it themselves, only end up making matters worse.
    565142|00000000||But enough about that. Find some buckthorn and we'll finish what they started.
    565221|00000000||Hm-hm. Fine, if everything's ready, say the word and we'll get to work.
    565219|00000000||All right, about the griffin - learn what you can. We gotta make a lure that'll work. Soon as we do, we can start.

Geralt met this extraordinary man in Skellige, where he had gone to hunt the notorious Grossbart brothers.

It was he who convinced the guard to let Geralt out, warning Geralt first that he would one day demand a favor in return. Geralt had managed to forget about the whole incident - but not Simun. The old man found Geralt and demanded he repay his debt.<br>
   1051829|00000000||Geralt decided he'd rather stain his honor than spill the blood of an innocent man. Simun did not accept this excuse and decided to kill Geralt alongside his age-old rival. The old warrior underestimated the witcher, however, and after a short fight he died from wounds delivered by the witcher's blade.
   1051828|00000000||Geralt did what Simun demanded - he killed a man who had done him no wrong. As you can see, dear reader, at times one must act dishonorably in order to maintain one's honor.

    522281|00000000||As I recall, Vigi wanted to cross a frozen lake and scale the mountains.
    424312|00000000||They say the giant came from there, awoken by the frost that gripped the land around the tower.
    424314|00000000||Twas a harsh winter, suited that man-eater perfectly! And it can only get worse! Even the gods… well… hm.

    522101|00000000||He is Crach's son.
    419784|00000000||Clever lad, put together a fine crew: hearty drinkers and warriors both. Why, the times I've had to piece together tables and benches after hostin' them…
    424262|00000000||The Undvik lads he took on - no spring minnows either. In fact, 'twas a Clan Tordarroch man gave Hjalmar the idea for the expedition. The shipwright, what's his name…
    419788|00000000||Vigi.
    419790|00000000||That's him. Hoped to earn a new byname - "the Fearless." Till now they'd called him "the Loon."

   1054653|00000000||As you surely recall, Geralt knew Ciri had been in Novigrad, that she had contacted Dudu and me and that afterwards all three of us had plummeted straight into a writhing snake pit of trouble. The last person to have seen Ciri was yours truly, but I, too, had disappeared without a trace. Geralt accurately surmised that Dudu would be the easiest of our ill-fated trio to find. He went to the one person who could help him do this - Priscilla.<br>
   1054654|00000000||It should be noted that Priscilla counted an incomparable ingenuity amongst her many virtues. Barely had Geralt explained the problem when she hit upon a solution. Dudu had taken on some unknown form and gone into hiding. Their only hope of luring him out - a clear sign from his old friends in Madame Irina's mummers' troupe. <br><br>Priscilla thus decided to put on a play - one Dudu would be sure to attend and that would clearly convey it was safe for him to reveal himself. Geralt agreed to the plan and the two got down to work.<br>
   1054655|00000000||The play was a success. Although not the finest spectacle to ever grace the Butchers' Yard, it more than sufficed for Priscilla's purposes - Dudu attended the play and revealed himself at its end. Geralt quickly pulled him behind the curtain and began questioning him about me and Ciri. This is how the witcher learned I was a prisoner of the Church of the Eternal Fire.
   1049272|00000000||Tell Priscilla what you've learned about Dudu.

   1084793|00000000||While strolling the bustling streets of Novigrad, Geralt came across a most intriguing notice. It suggested the man named de Jonkheer had sold some poor fool the house which Sarah, the lovable yet mischievous godling, used as her dwelling and playground. The notice made it clear the new owner was not amused by his unwanted tenant's pranks. Geralt decided to check up on Sarah and see how she was doing...<br>
   1084794|00000000||Geralt wasn't sure what he expected to find in the "haunted house" - but it sure wasn't that. The dreamer, having learned about Sarah from Geralt, had decided to get to know her.

   1077752|00000000||<i>Barely nicked me, I'll be fine.</i><br>– Last words of an unknown hunter <br><br>Though all arachasae are highly venomous, this breed produces an especially strong toxin. A few drops are enough to kill a grown man – unless that man is a witcher, whose mutations will neutralize small amounts of this venom. Large quantities, however, will kill anything they touch, with mutations only prolonging an inevitable and painful death in such instances.<br>
   1077753|00000000||Venomous arachasae produce colossal amounts of this toxin and deploy it during combat in many ways. Before striking a venomous arachas will cover its pincers and teeth with a thick coating of this deadly liquid. It will then squirt the venom at its to its opponent to weaken it, and once locked in direct combat, will continue spraying the noxious ooze all around itself, meaning every breath brings its victim closer to death. Like other members of this species, venomous arachasae use prehensile feelers to grab and immobilize their prey. When attempting to fight such a creature a witcher should drink Golden Oriole, which will reduce his body's vulnerability to poison, and then attack from a safe distance with crossbow or bombs before dealing the finishing blows with a silver sword enhanced with a coating of insectoid oil.

   1061654|00000000||Vesemir was the oldest living member of the Wolf School and most likely the oldest witcher of any school on the Continent.<br><br>About as long in years as the ruins of Kaer Morhen themselves and though eternally complaining about his creaky bones, this master of the witcher trade gave no thought to a well-deserved retirement. Gray but still spry, he continued to ply the monster hunting trade into his golden years - effectively, too, as he'd seen more beasts than all his students put together.<br><br>A harsh and demanding instructor in Geralt's youth, over the years he had become something of an adoptive father and mentor to the other witchers, always ready to help with sage advice and steady hands.<br>
   1061655|00000000||In the spring of 1272, when our story begins, Vesemir had joined Geralt on his search for Yennefer, trekking with him through war-ravaged Temeria.<br>
   1061656|00000000||Vesemir always said no witcher had ever died in his bed, so death in combat surely awaited him as well. Death's wait ended on that mournful day when the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen in pursuit of Ciri. Vesemir gave his all to protect his former ward, whom he had always treated like an adopted granddaughter, and died a hero's death at the hands of Imlerith, the Hunt's cruel general.

Once again it was proven - something which I, dear reader, know all too well - that man knows no greater enemy than a woman scorned.

Not surprisingly, the captain of the nearby guardpost did not appreciate this culinary choice and put out a bounty on the monster's head.<br>

    406064|00000000||Find Keira.
   1050860|00000000||Nothing about sorceresses should be taken at face value. Their faces least of all - those perfect, ever youthful visages have as little to do with nature as Hierarch Hemmelfart has with charity. If anyone should have learned to think twice when dealing with them, it was Geralt, and yet still he accepted Keira's dinner invitation.<br><br>During what Geralt naively thought to be innocent conversation between friends, Keira tricked him into revealing information about the mage Alexander's laboratory and then, when he was least expecting it, sent him to sleep with a spell so he could not stop her from carrying out her nefarious plans...<br>
   1050862|00000000||Yet Geralt did not allow Keira to triumph. He sensed she wanted Alexander's notes on the Catriona plague for her own immoral ends and so stopped her from leaving Velen. This led to a fight during which Geralt was forced to take Keira's life. And so, in this most unfortunate and disheartening way, their stormy relationship came to an end.
   1050861|00000000||Geralt caught Keira red-handed as she was leaving the tower with the results of Alexander's research on the Catriona plague. Although he feared the sorceress would use these notes for nefarious purposes, Geralt decided to let her go. Whether it was because he ultimately believed her assurances that no one would suffer as a result of her actions, or because he wanted to avoid a potentially bloody conflict - difficult to tell. Geralt is a man of many secrets, including ones he keeps even from me.<br>
   1050863|00000000||After leaving Velen Keira went to see King Radovid. The sorceress hoped the king would realize the importance of Alexander's research and pardon her earlier crimes so that she could continue the experiments at his court, with the aim of producing a cure for Catriona - or finding a way to turn it into an unprecedentedly destructive weapon.<br><br>Yet while Radovid shall go down in history for many reasons, being a patron of the sciences or a merciful ruler will not be among them. And so Keira found no amnesty or laboratory waiting for her, but instead only a cruel and painful death.
   1054766|00000000||Geralt caught Keira red-handed as she was leaving the tower with the results of Alexander's research on the Catriona plague. She was convinced these notes could be used to find a cure for this decimating disease. What's more, she hoped that the prospect of obtaining such a cure would convince King Radovid to let bygones be bygones and host Keira at his court. I doubt Radovid would have proven so broad-minded - luckily, Geralt convinced Keira to abandon these foolish hopes and give Oxenfurt a miss, seeking shelter at Kaer Morhen instead.
   1087104|00000000||Geralt was understandably less than pleased with Keira's treatment of him, but he decided to let the sorceress go. He felt whatever she was scheming was not more important than the great tasks he had before him at that moment.

Like ravenous, feral dogs they are capable only of mindlessly attacking whatever crosses their path.<br>
   1077936|00000000||The Hounds' chief weapons are their claws and teeth. Their battle tactics rely on knocking their opponents to the ground before tearing them to shreds. Badly wounded Hounds fall into a kind of frenzy that adds to their deadly might. These beasts also use their powers over the cold to freeze the ground around them and create sharp spikes of ice. Creatures born of frost, they feel pain from the Igni Sign, and there is also reason to believe Axii can momentarily weaken their drive to kill and somewhat weaken these fierce foes.<br><br>The Hounds' icy nature also means they can draw strength from extreme cold. Thus one should be particularly on guard when fighting them during blizzards or in glacial regions. Elven legends likewise claim they gain strength when a red moon - a known herald of the Hunt's arrival - hangs in the sky.

   1002636|00000000||Ciri pulled Geralt aside for a confidential heart-to-heart. She confided to him that Avallac'h had a hidden lair, a secret place that not even Ciri, his star pupil and long-time traveling companion, had been allowed to visit. Intrigued, Geralt decided to enter this secret lair and find out what the Seer was hiding.<br><br>The most important part of any conspiracy is for the co-conspirators to trust each other fully, and Ciri's revelation had cast a shadow of suspicion on Avallac'h. Geralt knew light must be shed on this shadow before it proved too late.<br>
   1002637|00000000||It turned out Avallac'h's well-guarded secret was a hidden laboratory in which he carried out research on Lara Dorren's gene - the gene Ciri bore within her, the cause of her power and her misfortune. Ciri was understandably less than thrilled to see herself through Avallac'h's eyes as a subject in some twisted experiment.<br><br>Meanwhile, they also discovered this secret research wasn't the only reason the Seer kept the place hidden. Avallac'h seemed to have been using it as a pleasure alcove for trysts with his elven lover. Who would have thought? It turns out even the wisest of sages is not always driven by pure reason alone.

   1048619|00000000||That the Wild Hunt would come for Ciri as soon as Geralt found her was more than certain. The witcher thus decided to prepare to fend off their inevitable attack and asked all the friends he deemed capable of facing the Hunt in battle to lend their blade - or wand, or axe, or druid's staff, or whatever their chosen death-dealing instrument might be. The site he chose for the battle against the fiercest foe he'd ever crossed - Kaer Morhen. Where else?<br>
   1048620|00000000||Geralt crisscrossed the Continent and gathered a crew of the most talented individuals of his time - the fighters, that is, talented lovers, such as myself, not being needed at this moment. The next step? Defeat the Wild Hunt.
   1048621|00000000||Pride? Sloth? A reluctance to risk his friends' lives? Whatever the reason, in the end Geralt did not ask everyone who might have aided him for help. Luckily he could always count on the help of the witchers of Kaer Morhen, as well as that of Yennefer, to whom Ciri was like a daughter.

   1077703|00000000||This elemental attacks using fireballs and streams of flame which reduce anything in their path to ashes in the blink of an eye. Like golems and other elementals, poison does not touch it nor does it bleed. Fire-based spells not only do no harm but in fact strengthen it - thus one should by no means think of striking it with Igni. Though vulnerable to  silver blades, getting within sword's reach of one is dangerous due to the furnace-like heat they emanate. When fighting a fire elemental one should thus strike from a distance, using frost-spewing and dimeritium bombs, for they will do it the most damage.

    506089|00000000||This curse that holds Morkvarg - pretty interesting.
    506090|00000000||Is that so?
    506091|00000000||Mhm. Anything he tries to eat turns to ash. But he chewed a piece of his own flesh and almost died. As I see it--

    397144|00000000||Shortly after landing on Skellige's shores, Geralt was summoned by his old friend, Jarl Crach an Craite. The winded messenger who brought him this news did not know why his master had requested the witcher’s presence. Geralt, however, knew Crach well enough to know that the Jarl would not ask him to come without an important reason, and so he set off without delay towards Kaer Trolde castle, the ancestral home of the an Craite clan.

   1034402|00000000||Those under Roche's command rarely defied orders. When they did, the task of disciplining them fell to Roche's second-in-command, Ves. No one who endured a reprimand from this tight-lipped yet strong-armed soldier would ever think of insubordination again.<br><br>Yet this time Ves strayed from her usual loyalty and ignored Roche's orders by leaving her post without permission. Faced with an unusual dilemma, Vernon decided to turn to the witcher for help.<br>
   1034403|00000000||The peasants of Mulbrydale had helped Roche's guerillas in the past, so Ves decided to stand in their defense now, in their hour of need, though she knew this was a hopeless and nearly suicidal mission. Had not Geralt and Roche come to the rescue in the last minute, Ves would surely have died a premature death after being cut down by Nilfgaardians. Yet as it were, the imperial troops were defeated - and their leader was killed on the witcher's request.<br>
   1058785|00000000||The peasants of Mulbrydale had helped Roche's guerillas in the past, so Ves decided to stand in their defense now, in their hour of need, though she knew this was a hopeless and nearly suicidal mission. Had not Geralt and Roche come to the rescue in the last minute, Ves would surely have died a premature death after being cut down by Nilfgaardians. Yet as it were, the imperial troops were defeated - but their leader escaped with his life thanks to Roche's intervention and Geralt's support.<br>
   1076089|00000000||Yet Roche and Geralt did not come to the rescue in time. Ves fought to save the peasants of Mulbrydale - though she knew full well she stood no chance of winning against her substantially more numerous opponents. No historian will write of this struggle, nor will any bard sing of it, and no gravestone shall mark Ves' resting place.
   1086305|00000000||Vernon Roche fell into dour spirits after Geralt's conversation with Radovid at the chess club. He didn't want to say right then what had blackened his mood. Instead, he asked the witcher to come talk to him at his hideout near Oxenfurt.
   1087095|00000000||Though Geralt had promised to meet Roche at his hideout, he never showed. To this day I don't know if he forgot, didn't want to or simply had more important matters to tend to. The fact remains, however, that he never met up with Roche and never found out what the former Blue Stripes commander had been scheming.
   1087096|00000000||Geralt's first reflex was to agree to help Roche with his trouble with Ves, but when he thought things over, he concluded he shouldn't get involved in an internal conflict between a superior and his subordinate.

    569705|00000000||What his father did to his mother… the pellar could not look upon it.

    466831|00000000||While meandering through the sunny but war-damaged lands near Oxenfurt, Geralt's sensitive ears picked up a very strange sound - something between off-key singing and the bellowing of a stuck pig. Geralt would be a poor excuse for a witcher if he did not investigate such a matter.<br>
   1051219|00000000||It turned out the dubious musical talents belonged to a troll who believed himself part of the Redanian army. His fondest dream was for fort he had been assigned to guard to look like a proper Redanian fort. Bear in mind that a troll's mental capacity is roughly that of a none-too-bright toddler, and you'll understand why this particular one felt a Redanian fort should be painted in bright Redanian colors. Geralt brought him red and white paint, which made him as happy as a child finding a present under his pillow.<br>

   1086971|00000000||<br>The witcher killed Melusine and along with her the sirens that made up her ghastly entourage. The inhabitants of Svorlag needed fear her no longer - and could now gather the remains of their loved ones from her cave.
   1087405|00000000||<i>I… I saw a shadow… Great wings, like a cloud passin' o'er the sky. Then I heard him scream.</i><br>– Britt of Svorlag<br>
   1081807|00000000||In the mountains near the village of Svorlag in Skellige lies an enormous complex of caves. For many centuries they were given wide berth on account of the bloodthirsty ekhidna known as Melusine who had made them into her lair.<br><br>Melusine was a beast so powerful some islanders worshiped her as a semi-divine being. The witcher, however, harbored no such delusions. He knew she was an extremely powerful monster - but a monster all the same. This meant she could be killed. To do so, he would need the highest quality of bolts, a solid silver blade - and a steady hand.

   1059694|00000000||Bart, the troll guarding Dijkstra's treasure, could have been the poster boy for the latest craze among Novigrad's wealthy strata, a trend that had swept over everyone from bankers and merchants to underworld crime bosses. The fashion in question prized guards marked not just by fierce loyalty, but also by massive size, endless stamina and crushing physical strength. A well-developed intellect, on the other hand, was considered unnecessary and quite possibly detrimental to the guard's performance. To be blunt, a good watchman should be brainless enough to render any thought of betraying his master impossible.<br><br>That is why trolls, ogres and, as a last result, magic crossbreeds were highly prized for such roles.

    397165|00000000||Geralt's first clue? A brutally murdered and mangled body. The villagers all agreed the Woodland Spirit had killed the man - but their explanations of this creature's motives could not have been more different. The elders among them claimed the Spirit, who had cared for their village for generations, was now punishing them for having broken the pact they had once made. As for the youth present, they claimed the Woodland Spirit was nothing but a cruel brute that killed for its own pleasure - and that rather than worship it, they should get rid of it once and for all.<br><br>Geralt promised to help with their problem - though he did not yet know which side was right. The witcher exercised his better judgment and decided his first move must be to find out what this Woodland Spirit really was - and why it had begun to kill.<br>
    397254|00000000||Fayrlund's supposed guardian turned out to be a leshen - a rare and dangerous monster that can force animals, plants and, as soon became clear, even people to do its bidding. For generations the villagers had worshipped it and offered it sacrifices, and all the while it leeched off their life force, a parasite masquerading as a guardian. A band of young warriors led by Sven questioned the old order and asked Geralt to take care of the monster in the manner of witchers.<br><br>Geralt agreed. While he was away tracking the leshen in the nearby woods, Sven decided to usher in the new era himself by murdering all the village elders. When Geralt arrived back in the settlement it was too late to save it from fratricidal bloodshed. He thus collected his reward from a man who had killed more people in one afternoon than the monster had in years and walked away from the village without a backwards glance.<br>
    397290|00000000||Geralt made two discoveries during his investigation. First of all, the Woodland Spirit turned out to be a leshen - a rare monster, though one known to witchers. Secondly, to his great surprise Geralt found that this beast truly did help the village of Fayrlund, training the villagers in dark rituals how to become unequaled hunters and warriors. Those who didn't survive its trials never returned from the woods - their lives were the price the monster demanded. <br><br>The monster had become intertwined with the village - so integral to their way of life that Geralt decided it was safer to renew the old pacts made with the beast than to kill it. The village youth, however, could not be reconciled to a return to the old order. Though lacking the courage to kill the hated Woodland Spirit themselves, they mustered enough bravery to rise up against the elders who worshipped it. Geralt left the village before the bloodshed started. After all, the role of a witcher is to protect men from monsters, not from themselves.
    397291|00000000||Geralt made two discoveries during his investigation. First of all, the Woodland Spirit turned out to be a leshen - a rare monster, though one known to witchers. Secondly, to his great surprise Geralt found that this beast truly did help the village of Fayrlund, training their hunters and warriors in the nearby woods - though it exacted a price in human lives.<br><br>Even so, the witcher decided more good would come from renewing the old pact between the villagers and the leshen than from killing the beast. Harald, leader of the village elders, rewarded the witcher for keeping the old traditions alive. The village youth, however, with Sven in the lead, could not be reconciled to a return to the old order. Though lacking the courage to kill the hated Woodland Spirit themselves, they mustered enough bravery to rise up against the elders who worshipped it.<br><br>It fell upon Geralt yet again to choose the lesser evil. He defended some men by killing others - even more, perhaps, than the monster he was supposed to protect them against.

   1055870|00000000||The merchant Geralt found standing by the side of the road in White Orchard was extremely distraught. He had been hauling some precious goods to the Nilfgaardian camp when his horse spooked and veered off the road, pulling the merchant's cart with it and dumping the whole works in the foggy swamp outside the camp. The poor horse became trapped in the muck and soon was devoured by the monsters who inevitably lurk in such places. The merchant was understandably afraid to go retrieve his goods, and thus asked the witcher to do it for him - in return for a sizable reward.<br>
   1055871|00000000||The witcher found the merchant's priceless cargo and the grateful man repaid him in gold for his trouble. The contract had turned out to be a simple one, without any moral dilemmas or wrenching doubts about where lesser evil lay, and to top it all off it ended with a satisfactory and immediately-paid reward - the witcher surely wished they could all be like that.<br>
   1055872|00000000||Seemingly straightforward stories often turn out to be anything but. The witcher found the merchant's cart - and beside it signs of a malicious attack organized by human hands. It seemed the merchant had not told Geralt the whole truth. The confrontation that followed confirmed the witcher's suspicions - rather than stay to plead his innocence, the merchant immediately ran as fast as his legs could take him.<br>
   1055873|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. After Geralt heard the man explain his story and motives, he decided to let him go to continue his futile battle against the Nilfgaardian occupiers. Do not act so surprised, dear reader - witchers might be neutral by principle, but it was no secret where Geralt's sympathies lay in the struggle between the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br>
   1055874|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. Though Geralt was skeptical about the man's chances in his partisan struggle against the mighty Nilfgaardian occupier, he decided to let him go... but kept the priceless object for himself. Perhaps he thought rewarding a cheat would not be the proper thing to do - or perhaps he was driven by a simple need for coin. It is not my place to judge, dear reader.<br>
   1055875|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. With his back against the wall, the soldier called on high ideals and Geralt's sense of patriotism in order to convince the witcher of the worthiness of his cause - but to no avail, for Geralt nevertheless handed him over to the nearest Nilfgaardian outpost. The witcher was clearly of the opinion that someone who acts like a bandit should end like a bandit, no matter how lofty his declared motives.<br>
   1055876|00000000||Geralt chased after the lying merchant but the scoundrel managed to give him the slip. He never did find out what really had happened out there in the murky swamps of White Orchard.<br>

   1054948|00000000||Ah, what times those were, times of adventure, action and unexpected twists around every corner! As you surely recall, Ciri and I escaped from Whoreson Junior's headquarters only to wind up trapped in a corner by the Temple Guard. Ciri managed to get away, but I was captured and tossed in the Temple Isle dungeons. From there I was to be transported to Deireadh, the infamous Oxenfurt prison, to await my execution - and here my tale would surely end, had my friends not devised an ingenious plan to ambush the transport.<br>
   1054991|00000000||Yet even the best-laid plans can go awry if fortune deems it so. The ambush succeeded only partially, as one of the guards tossed me on his horse and fled in the heat of the action. Not losing my cool for my second, I quickly concocted a plan of my own, and it had almost come to fruition when Geralt burst in and broke me free in his typical clumsy yet, granted, effective way. But do not think me ungrateful or cold-hearted - any irritation I felt soon faded in the sincere joy that filled my heart upon seeing my old friend once more.

   1086979|00000000||Some monsters are so powerful local populaces begin worshiping them as gods. Such was the case with the leshen dwelling in the woods near the Skellige village of Fayrlund. The elders were absolutely convinced the monster watched over them by defending them from their enemies and training their hunters.<br><br>The witcher had his doubts, however. Leshens are mean, self-serving creatures - and the ancient one living in the woods near Fayrlund was surely no exception.<br><br>Geralt knew freeing the villagers from their supposed protector's grasp would be no easy task - if he decided to even try. The leshen known as the Woodland Spirit was so powerful as to have mastered the art of marking. This meant the monster had inserted his essence into one of the residents of Fayrlund. As long as this unfortunate soul remained alive and near the settlement, the leshen would always be reborn near its lair.<br><br>Yet even with the marked one eliminated, killing the leshen would be no easy task. The monster commanded the obedience of the denizens of the woods - it could thus call on wolves, ravens or even the trees themselves for help. Luckily, it had a weakness as well: it was vulnerable to fire, that born of the Igni Sign in particular.
   1086980|00000000||<br>The witcher managed to kill the leshen, ending the murders terrorizing the woods around Fayrlund. Yet this did not mean the villagers' troubles were over…
   1086981|00000000||<br>In the end, however, there never was a battle between Geralt and the Woodland Spirit. Geralt knew that the leshen was surely less benevolent than the elders thought - but he also knew killing it would do more harm than good.

   1058808|00000000||Graden was one of the witch hunters in King Radovid's service. Unlike a great many of his comrades, he came across as a level-headed fellow, one free of prejudice, at least in his dealings with witchers.<br>
   1058812|00000000||Geralt's subsequent encounters with Graden confirmed his suspicion that the man was not a typical hunter. Graden was unorthodox in his methods, prioritizing results over ideological purity and a strict adherence to the hunters' codex, even though, as he was undoubtedly aware, this approach would hardly endear him to his superiors.<br><br>After the affair in the swamp was over, he returned to Oxenfurt, taking Tamara with him.

   1050963|00000000||Once again Geralt had a near impossible choice to make - a choice between a greater and lesser evil. While preparing to hunt the griffin, he had come across one of the beast's victims - a simple peasant woman named Lena. She had been on her way to meet her lover when the griffin attacked. The beast had mortally wounded her. A witcher's potion could save her life… or cause her to perish in agony.<br>
   1050967|00000000||The witcher decided to help Lena. Geralt then left White Orchard before he could learn the results of the risky treatment he applied. Soon afterwards, while visiting the Nilfgaardian garrison in Velen, he learned the woman had survived. The imperial infantryman with whom she was to meet the ill-fated evening of the griffin's attack had brought her to a nearby village. Sadly, none of this denoted a happy ending. Though the wounds on Lena's body had healed, the toxins in the witcher's brew had melted her mind. This was not the first time a cure had proven worse than the disease.<br>
   1059003|00000000||They say witchers do not feel as humans do. That they are stripped of emotion, untroubled by doubts and dilemmas. This might be true for some of the caste - Lambert possibly being a case in point. But there is no doubt Geralt was different. He honestly debated what to do with Lena, considered what would be the lesser evil, and did so for so long that the woman finally succumbed to her wounds.

   1051140|00000000||Geralt happened across a terrified bard who trembled when he spoke of his "beloved", yet other than that refused to say an ill word about the woman. Even stranger, everything seemed to indicate his betrothed lived in a cave. Geralt decided to check out what sort of curious couple he was dealing with.<br>
   1052000|00000000||It turned out the bard's "beloved" was a hideous water hag. No wonder the thought of her caress made him shake in fear and revulsion. Geralt dealt with her as he usually deals with monsters.
   1057732|00000000||While traversing the charming yet dangerous Skellige isles, Geralt happened across a mysterious cave. His instincts told him there would be more than bats and newts dwelling within - and so he decided to enter it.<br>
   1057735|00000000||It turned out the cave had become home to a water hag who would lure victims in order to kill and eat them. Geralt dealt with this evil monster as it deserved and continued on his way.

   1061110|00000000||Geralt's encounter with the crazed man building an enormous ship while conversing with the cut-off heads of his former crew was, to say the least, an unusual experience.<br>
   1061111|00000000||Though this strange shipbuilder was forced into his labors by the ice giant and his bloodthirsty sirens, it seemed his work had become a kind of escape for his beleaguered mind.<br><br>Surely that was why this unfortunate man showed such dedication to his dubiously worthy cause.<br>
   1061112|00000000||In the end Geralt learned the true identity of the mad shipbuilder of Undvik. He was in fact Harald Houndsnout, a jarl who was thought to have been killed by the giant along with his crew.<br><br>Though rumors about his death were clearly exaggerated, it was hard to say whether surviving had not proved the worse fate.<br>
   1061113|00000000||News of the Giant's death clearly delighted the madman - but he rejected the witcher's offer to take him back to Ard Skellig. For some reason he felt he could not rest until he finished building the ship.<br>

   1075678|00000000||Though Geralt avoided politics like the plague, there were times when he simply couldn't avoid getting entangled. This was very much the case when Roche and Dijkstra convinced him to find their co-conspirator. The man had gone off undercover to resolve a certain matter among the Nilfgaardians and simply disappeared.<br>
   1075679|00000000||It turned out the missing co-conspirator was none other than Thaler - Geralt's old acquaintance from Vizima, a man of many talents and a tongue to make a sailor blush. He was traveling disguised as a shoemaker when trolls seized him and demanded he cobble them up some decent footwear - like the kind humans have. Thaler didn't thrive in troll captivity and so was delighted to see Geralt, who took out his large oppressors with ease. Geralt had hoped that once he freed Thaler he'd learn something more about the mysterious plan to assassinate King Radovid, but Thaler's lips remained firmly sealed...
   1086575|00000000||Upon finding Dijkstra mingling among the fugitive mages, then watching him assist them in their flight, Geralt got the sinking feeling the erstwhile spy would want a favor in return. He could not have been more correct, for as soon as the mages had set sail for Kovir's hospitable shores, Dijkstra confessed that he had set in motion a plot to assassinate Radovid and asked the witcher to meet him promptly at the Passiflora.
   1087097|00000000||Dijkstra can be quite convincing at times, but on this occasion Geralt's reluctance to get involved in political matters won out over his curiosity and desire to earn some coin. Besides, doing a contract for Dijkstra's one thing, but participating in a coup - that's another thing altogether. Geralt decided to keep his distance, and hoped by doing so to keep his head as well...
   1087098|00000000||When he learned Dijkstra and Roche were planning to find the missing spy, Geralt agreed to help - after all, a missing man's a missing man, and deserves aid whether he's a tinker, a tailor, a soldier or… well, you get the point. But when he thought things over more carefully, he concluded he shouldn't meddle in high politics, and he especially shouldn't participate in an assassination - and that's exactly what he'd be doing by finding the missing spy. He thus abandoned the task, and Roche and Dijkstra never mentioned the unfortunate matter again.

   1060976|00000000||Most druids in Skellige differ from the deeply-rooted Continental stereotype of a graybearded old man in white robes bowing before sacred oaks, taming wyverns and pestering local lords with petitions to add yet another species to the list of protected beasts. Ermion, Geralt's old acquaintance, was no exception in this regard.<br><br>This stiff-bearded, spindly man was the leader of the Druids' Circle in Skellige. He was also Jarl Crach an Craite's advisor on matters of magic and the mystical, as well as on any and all issues requiring more refinement than a well-timed uppercut or a hard-swung axe.<br><br>Ermion was known to be obstinate and to have a tendency, quite rare in Skellige, to consider all possible consequences of a particular course of action before it was undertaken. All this meant that conversing with him demanded a considerable amount of time and patience.<br>
   1060978|00000000||Given all this, one can hardly be surprised that Yennefer and Geralt's "rash" and "highly irresponsible" actions regarding the magic anomaly - stealing a priceless artifact from a private chamber being first among them - put Ermion quite out of sorts.<br>
   1060979|00000000||However, despite his difficult character and his somewhat testy relationship with Geralt, Ermion agreed at once to travel to Kaer Morhen and help defend Ciri from the Wild Hunt's forces.<br>
   1060985|00000000||When persuasion and reason failed, Ermion would, as a last resort, turn to violence - and then he became a foe to be reckoned with.<br><br>Madman Lugos found this out personally when, in a fit of rage, he attacked Ermion and Geralt. As they had in the past, witcher and druid stood side by side and fought a common enemy.

   1078438|00000000||Geralt had a wonderful time slapping down cards with familiar faces and added several powerful new cards to his collection while he was at it.

   1049838|00000000||Crach an Craite, an old friend, invited Geralt and Yennefer to a farewell feast for the recently-departed King Bran. One does not refuse such invitations in Skellige, and so, willing or not, Geralt had no choice but to meet Yennefer at the castle gates and attend the wake at her side.<br>
   1049891|00000000||Bran's wake was in full swing, with mead flowing plentifully and Geralt making quite a splash with the jarls, when suddenly Yennefer announced she needed to meet with the witcher in a more private setting. Yet she did not have in mind what you do, dear reader. Instead, she wanted Geralt to accompany her as she broke into the druid Ermion's laboratory. Her goal? To steal the artifact known as the Mask of Uroboros.<br>As you can see, life with Yennefer was full of surprises, a fact Geralt had grown used to and even, one dares say, quite fond of.<br>
   1049894|00000000||After much wandering, Yennefer had finally found the mask she had been seeking. When Ermion's laboratory grew dangerous, she teleported herself and Geralt back to her quarters. Once there, they… well, what they did is not really any of your concern, dear reader.<br><br>Afterwards, they returned to the wake.<br>
   1049898|00000000||Crach an Craite only arrived as the wake was drawing to a close - he and the other jarls had locked themselves away in a proverbial smoke-filled room to scheme plans for Skellige's future. That business finished, he now pulled Geralt and Yen aside for a talk. When he heard they were searching for Ciri, he agreed at once to provide them with everything they needed.<br><br>Luckily for Crach's treasury, Yennefer did not need everything, just Ermion's permission to examine a mysteriously deformed forest - the result of a magic explosion that might have involved Ciri.<br>Crach promised to convince Ermion, and as his word was as reliable as his beard was red, Geralt and Yennefer set off at once towards the magic-damaged woods.
   1049895|00000000||After much wandering Yennefer finally acquired the mask she sought. As Ermion's laboratory had grown rather dangerous, she teleported Geralt and herself back to the wake, where they landed with a thud in the middle of the ongoing party. Luckily all the feastgoers were already too inebriated to notice anything out of the usual.<br>

   1053563|00000000||Vesemir's death tore a gaping hole in Ciri's heart and left only a burning drive for revenge to fill it. This drive burned all the higher when she learned from Avallac'h that Imlerith, the general of the Hunt who murdered Vesemir, would be attending the Crones' sabbath on Bald Mountain. Ciri smelled blood and decided at once to travel to No Man's Land and kill Imlerith. Geralt, that calculating, practical-minded witcher, as usual caved immediately to his adopted daughter's wishes and agreed to accompany her on this expedition. The pair thus slipped out of Kaer Morhen in the cool light of morning and galloped off to find vengeance.<br>
   1053564|00000000||Vengeance is what they found, and, though served warm, it was nonetheless sweet. The duo found their way to the top of Bald Mountain and there Ciri killed two of the three Crones while Geralt triumphed in a deathmatch against Imlerith. The only bitter note - the third Crone escaped, taking with her Vesemir's medallion, the only memento Ciri had kept of her dead friend and mentor.

   1056325|00000000||Emhyr var Emreis had been searching for his daughter Ciri for quite some time. Even the most dubious sighting of an ashen-haired young woman with a scar on her cheek would send imperial spies scurrying.<br><br>Not even the harsh conditions of war-ravaged Velen deterred them - indeed, it is there they had been most successful, determining that Ciri had been, and possibly still was, in the region. Reports of a similar nature had also come in from Novigrad, but remained unconfirmed. Emhyr's spooks had gathered nothing concrete from Skellige, but an explosion of magical energy had taken place on one of the isles, and it seemed likely that Ciri had been somehow involved.<br>
   1058834|00000000||During his search, Geralt discovered that Ciri had indeed spent time in each of these places and, though the Lion Cub herself remained at large, he found someone who had until recently been her companion. There was one catch, however: this unfortunate individual, known only as Uma, seemed to be suffering the effects of a curse that had transformed him into the most hideously ugly and maddeningly stupid being on the planet. Try as he might, Geralt could not communicate with him in this form.<br>

   1077283|00000000||Once native to the far south, this invasive species migrated north over the course of decades, adjusting as it went to new climates and temperatures.

   1053427|00000000||They say chess is the game of kings, and Radovid proved this point twice over during his meeting with Geralt. First, by playing the royal game at the Oxenfurt Chess Club while they met, and then by treating Geralt like a pawn he could send out to do his bidding. His requested move? Witcher takes sorceress: his spies had reported finding signs of Philippa Eilhart's presence in the elven ruins outside of Novigrad. Geralt was to go there and retrieve her. Normally Geralt resisted attempts to command him around the board, but he owed Radovid a favor - and had his own reasons for wanting to find Philippa...<br>
   1053428|00000000||Geralt found and searched Philippa's hideout. Though there were signs of her presence everywhere, the sorceress herself was long gone.<br><br>She had, however, left one thing behind that could prove of great value - a damaged crystal from her megascope. The witcher knew such a gem could, if properly probed, reveal priceless information about her doings. He thus was faced with a choice - should he give the crystal to Radovid, or take it to one of his sorceress allies?<br>
   1053432|00000000||Geralt took the crystal to Yennefer. A bit of magic and she got it to play back a fragment from the last conversation Philippa had with Margarita Laux-Antille. From it they learned the sorceress, whom Radovid had blinded, was trying to restore her vision, and that both were planning to bring the Lodge of Sorceresses back to life.<br>
   1053433|00000000||Geralt took the crystal to Triss. A bit of magic and she got it to play back a fragment from the last conversation Philippa had with Margarita Laux-Antille. From it they learned the sorceress, whom Radovid had blinded, was trying to restore her vision, and that both were planning to bring the Lodge of Sorceresses back to life.<br>
   1053434|00000000||The witcher decided it would be best if such information never made it to Radovid's ears. He thus decided to leave the crystal with Yennefer.<br>
   1053435|00000000||The witcher decided it would be best if such information never made it to Radovid's ears. He thus decided to leave the crystal with Triss.<br>
   1053448|00000000||Out of a sense of duty, or perhaps a desire to receive at least part of the promised reward, Geralt returned to Radovid to tell him what he had found in Philippa's hideout. The king was clearly not pleased with the outcome of the investigation and dismissed the witcher. As for compensation for his trouble, sadly, the witcher had to go without...<br>
   1053439|00000000||Geralt encountered Radovid's men at the entrance to Philippa's hideout. They demanded the witcher give them the magic crystal, with assurances they would deliver it to the king personally. Geralt reluctantly accepted their offer.<br>
   1053454|00000000||As agreed, Geralt returned to Radovid and gave him the crystal from Philippa's megascope. Though the king was hoping to be handed a sorceress, not a cold, damaged lump of minerals, in the end he appreciated Geralt's effort and paid him his reward.<br>
   1053456|00000000||Although Geralt had given Radovid's men the crystal, he decided to go back to see the king anyway and tell him what he had found in Philippa's hideout. Yet as he had no proof to confirm his words, Radovid refused to give him his reward and sent him away with a sick smirk on his face.
   1087091|00000000||Though Geralt was curious to know what had become of Philippa, wandering around musty and undoubtedly trap-laden elven ruins did not seem like a pleasant way to spend his time. The idea of being the Redanian king's paid hound also did not appeal to him - so he abandoned the task and saw to more interesting and worthy matters instead.
   1087092|00000000||The witcher hesitated a long time before deciding what to do with the crystal - so long, in fact, that he forgot about it entirely. He never did learn what mysteries that damaged piece of megascope contained.

    455895|00000000||Should a soldier be held responsible for the decisions of his commanding officers? Is collective responsibility justice? To us, dear reader, these are rhetorical questions. Geralt, however, often found himself forced to answer them - and quickly. For example, once in Velen he happened across a group of villagers preparing to lynch a captured Nilfgaardian deserter. Not for the first time, the witcher had to decide which was the lesser evil...<br>
   1065293|00000000||The witcher made his decision. He defended the deserter and earned the peasants' ire. They attacked at once, and thus in order to save one man he had to kill many others.

   1055648|00000000||Vesemir told Geralt that Yennefer had set up her trusty megascope as soon as she arrived at Kaer Morhen, but could not get it to function for the life of her. This news greatly troubled the witcher. If Yennefer was planning to use her megascope, that meant a conversation with other sorceresses was in the works - and that in turn meant scheming, politics and other things Geralt truly could not stand.<br>
   1055649|00000000||As expected, Yennefer did not extend Geralt the warmest of greetings. Nevertheless, Geralt, ever the noble and patient soul, helped the sorceress eliminate the source of the magical disturbance. It turned out the culprit was a case of dimeritium bombs Lambert had carelessly placed near the sorceress' room. Tsk, tsk, Lambert.

Or troll boom man head.</i><br>– rock troll dwelling in a cave on Undvik<br><br>If while hiking high in the mountains you come across a walking stone, do not think your eyes deceive you. Instead, draw your sword – for before you stands a rock troll. True, not every encounter with these creatures ends in a fight - while not particularly intelligent, trolls are capable of reason – but it is better to prepare for the worst. Otherwise, your hike might end not on the summit, but in their stew.<br>
   1077867|00000000||Trolls are able to use fire and simple tools, and some of them have even mastered the basics of Common Speech. Though linguistic nuances such as conjugations and declinations escape them, they are extremely fond of riddles, rhymes and all sorts of wordplay, a fact a witcher in possession of a bit of wit can use to his advantage.<br><br>If a fight proves inevitable, one must watch out for the stones these trolls throw with great strength and shocking precision. Their powerful, heavy fists also present a danger, for they can buckle even the sturdiest breastplate or cuirass. Since their backs are covered in a layer of rocky growth, blows delivered from behind will not do them much damage. They must thus be fought directly, standing face to face – and preferably armed with a sword covered in a fresh coating of ogroid oil.

   1053771|00000000||Geralt ran into a suspicious gentleman who was looking for a woman who spoke in a strange, unknown tongue. He claimed they came from some far-off land far beyond the sea. She had kidnapped a child, and he had been tasked with finding and punishing her.<br>
   1053786|00000000||Geralt showed the shady gentleman the place where the woman was hiding then let him do as he wished. He had no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of a far-off and unknown country.<br>
   1053787|00000000||Geralt showed the shady gentleman where the woman was hiding, but did not let him hurt her. The story the man had told him seemed stretched and unlikely. Geralt defeated the fraud, and, unable to communicate with the woman, gave her a letter he had found on a corpse near the cave.<br>
   1077555|00000000||On a small isle in Skellige Geralt found a diary written by refugees from a far-off land. Their ship had wrecked and the fate of its passengers was unknown. Geralt hoped at least some had survived and he would one day have the chance to return this diary to them.<br>

    363562|00000000||What took you so long?
    363564|00000000||Went around, through town. Didn't want to come back via the sewers… Rather avoid pops, even with the antidote in my system.
    381784|00000000||I'm done investigating.
    381786|00000000||Done. Examined every nook of the sewers near your vault.
    320686|00000000||Go to the bathhouse with Triss.
    533488|00000000||Go to the fountain near the Passiflora.

    533492|00000000||Sneak up on Philippa without making too much noise.
   1048551|00000000||Talk to Triss Merigold.
   1048603|00000000||Triss returned to Novigrad after leaving Kaer Morhen with one goal - to find Philippa Eilhart. Soon after she made a shocking discovery - Philippa had been right under our very noses the whole time! Turned into an owl by some malicious spell, she then wound up in the hands of Zoltan, who, ignorant of his new pet's true identity, strived to make of her a replacement for his former foul-mouthed parrot companion, Field Marshal Duda.<br><br>Triss was not the only one to uncover Philippa's whereabouts, however. Coming to that conclusion slightly before her was Dijkstra, who shared with Philippa with the strongest bond possible - love turned to seething hate. The one-time spy and current mafia boss had captured Philippa and imprisoned her in his bathhouse. Triss and Geralt knew they must hurry - it was clear Dijkstra had not gone through all this trouble to chat with Philippa about old times. Vengeance was more likely on his agenda, vengeance for breaking his heart and daring to plot against him.<br>
   1048604|00000000||It is frightening to think how this story might have ended had Triss and Geralt not arrived at the bathhouse in the nick of time. A dimeritium collar had kept Philippa trapped in owl form, but somehow she had managed to free herself from it, revert to her true self, overcome her guards and start tearing the bathhouse apart. Dodging her furious blasts, Geralt was finally able to corner her and convince her he and Triss did not want to harm her - in fact, they needed her help. Though Dijkstra was vehemently opposed to letting the sorceress go, he ultimately realized resistance was futile in the face of Geralt's ironclad logic. And so Philippa Eilhart regained her freedom and joined the offensive against Eredin and his Red Riders.<br>

What's that, some kind of fish?</i><br>– Professor Artibus Joannes Rack, geographer, disappeared during a surveying expedition in Skellige<br><br>Ulfhedinn are a breed of werewolf found mainly in Skellige. The harsh and barren conditions of the isles might explain why they primarily hunt men and are stronger than their Continental brethren. Older and particularly dangerous ulfhedinn are called vorefs. Only a few daring warriors in all of Skellige history have managed to defeat an ulfhedinn, and each of them is commemorated in ballads as a hero to this day.<br>

I jumped into a wardrobe and stayed to listen, though it was uncomfortable as all get out. They said they'd sunk some great treasure ship by the rocks between Faroe and Ard Skellig, and that come morning they intended to go fish it out. Once they'd drunk themselves to sleep, I slipped out of the wardrobe and told Marie we should slit all their throats, get that treasure ourselves and leave these horrible isles, go somewhere better - Kovir, or even Novigrad!<br><br>Marie didn't take long to convince, because her husband was a true whoreson and beat her terribly, so Noorhis and his mates are bits in a fish's guts by now, and I'm off to find my fortune.<br><br>Who cares that I'm not too skilled a sailor and a storm's coming?

    591641|00000000||<i>Wolves aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Werewolves, though – they're every bit as bad and worse.</i><br>– Elsa Vilge, archer <br><br>Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside them. When in beastly form, they take the worst traits from each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's condition comes about through a curse, and the transformations happen outside his conscious control. When he reverts to human form, he has no memory of his deeds – otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life.<br>
   1077714|00000000||Werewolves are active at night, particularly when the moon is full. Though they hunt alone, when threatened they will summon wolves to aid them. Werewolves rarely feel the need to flee, for few adversaries put up much of a fight against them. They strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors and regenerate any damage received in mere moments. When fighting werewolves a witcher should wield a blade covered in oil harmful to the cursed and have a large supply of Devil's Puffballs handy.<br><br>A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must therefore equip himself with a great deal of patience – and sturdy armor.

The owner of these lands, a halfling named Holofernes Meiersdorf, told Geralt that his apiary had been haunted for some time by the Apiarian Phantom, a wraith which kills the bees and destroys the hives of wayward beekeepers. Geralt decided to look into the matter.<br>
   1053469|00000000||Geralt's investigation revealed the monster was hiding in the basement of an unfinished home near the Meiersdorf estate. What Geralt had to do was clear: enter the basement and kill the beast.<br>
   1053470|00000000||Once Geralt had forced his way in, he was greeted to an unexpected sight: the house's interior was completely frozen, and standing amidst the frost - a giant and terrifying creature Geralt knew to be one of the Wild Hunt's hounds. The beast put up quite the fight, but in the end Geralt proved stronger and bested his opponent. When he showed the beekeeper the trophy he had taken from the hound, he received a handsome reward.<br>
   1053471|00000000||Once Geralt had forced his way in, he was greeted to an unexpected sight: the house's interior was completely frozen, and standing amidst the frost - a giant and terrifying creature Geralt knew to be one of the Wild Hunt's hounds. The monster quickly realized it was outmatched and fled to hide in the surrounding fields, and Geralt was unable to track it down. Even though he had not fully finished his task, he returned to his employer. Meiersdorf feared the beast would return, but, acknowledging some work had been done, agreed to pay Geralt for his trouble.<br>

   1061076|00000000||Jarl Udalryk was an enigmatic figure to say the least. Some mysterious ill surrounded him, causing others to shirk his company.<br>
   1061083|00000000||Geralt could not help but notice that Udalryk did seem to be acting strangely, muttering to himself often and showing signs of suppressed panic, as if he lived in constant fear of something - or someone.<br>
   1061098|00000000||Geralt's private talk with the jarl confirmed the rumors. Udalryk was convinced the gods spoke to him, sending him prophetic dreams and demanding he make sacrifices.<br>
   1061104|00000000||The tale of the strife between Udalryk and his brother Aki over the family sword threw new light on the jarl's mysterious problems. That the voices he heard demanded he injure himself suggested a vengeful spirit was involved.<br>
   1061105|00000000||Udalryk's madness deepened ever more, finally prompting him to pluck out his own eye as payment for unspecified sins.<br>

That's an insult to endrega drones, who at least get off their arses to fight.</i><br>– Evelynn Harker, herbalist <br><br>Endrega males – called ‘drones' – are gluttonous creatures whose only aim in life is to eat, fight and reproduce. Yet when venturing outside their nests, these aggressive hunters attack any and every creature they come across.<br>
   1077737|00000000||Endrega drones live but brief lives, the culmination of which comes in the autumn when they fertilize the queen. They pass the time leading to that moment protecting the colony's territory. Weaker drones die in these battles, while the largest and strongest survive. These elect individuals' genes are passed down to the next generation of endregas, while they themselves are killed after fertilization takes place and their bodies used to feed the hive during the long winter months.<br><br>Drones are easy to identify thanks to their distinctive, cone-shaped abdomens. Unlike other endregas they can attack from a distance, sending out volleys of poisoned quills. As with all of their kind, bleeding has no effect on them and insectoid oil does them great harm.

   1048605|00000000||When it comes to matters of the heart, my friend the witcher was never one of the most decisive men in the world. That is why, when he unexpectedly found both Triss and Yennefer back in his life, he couldn't unravel the conundrum of which to choose and... led both to believe they were his one and only. Usually such stupidity ends in bitter words and tossed cutlery - but not this time.<br><br>When the three of them were alone, the sorceresses revealed to Geralt that they knew what he had done and... were fine it. They had concluded that they all cared about each other deeply, and fighting their instincts would defy nature's wishes. They had a special start planned for this new chapter in their lives - a romantic evening for just the three of them at the Kingfisher.
   1048606|00000000||"Don't keep two irons in the fire (especially if by 'irons' we mean sorceresses, and by 'keep in the fire' we mean 'simultaneously profess your love to both')" - an awkward motto, true, but Geralt of Rivia would have been wise to adopt it. Triss and Yennefer punished the two-timing witcher with admirable ingenuity and wit. I must admit I also played a hand in the prank - well, perhaps only a pinky finger, but still, my small role gave me tremendous satisfaction. To save Geralt from the revenge of wronged lovers - I could not help but savor such a magnificent turning of the tables.

    397137|00000000||While riding through the village nestled at the base of Kaer Trolde, Geralt spotted a notice posted by a certain Odhen of Rannvaig promising a bounty for information about his missing son. It seemed like a job for a witcher, and since Geralt was, as usual, hard up for coin, he decided to look into it.<br>
    397138|00000000||As Geralt passed through the village of Rannvaig, a man by the name of Odhen stopped him and asked for help in finding his missing son. The witcher, hearing honest fatherly despair in the man's voice and, no less importantly, feeling the lightness of his own purse, decided to look into the matter.<br>
    397139|00000000||Geralt tracked down and killed the fiend - avenging the death of Odhen's son and making sure no more Skelligers would share the boy's fate.<br>
   1051013|00000000||It turned out that Odhen's son and his friends had not just gone missing, but had been murdered, torn to pieces by a fiend. Geralt arrived too late to save the boys - but just in time to face the beast who had killed them. Sensing that it stood no chance in this fight, the beast fled - but there's no hiding from a witcher...<br>
   1086618|00000000||The restless soul that he is, Geralt is incapable of remaining stationary for long. Things were no different on Ard Skellig. While galavanting about the isle, Geralt happened on a fiend. Unlucky beast, for the witcher sliced it into ribbons. As it turned out, the fiend had done some shredding of its own prior to its demise. One of its recent victims - a young man who proved to be the offpsring of one Odhen from the village of Rannvaig. Odhen had been seeking his son for some time - alas, it need be said, fruitlessly.

   1051280|00000000||The Redanian army had placed blockades on the crossings of the Pontar, something which at one point proved quite inconvenient to the witcher. The guards refused to let him cross without showing a special pass issued by high command.<br>
   1051281|00000000||Luckily Geralt managed to get his hands on just such a pass and from then on could cross the Pontar border at will. I hope he did not abuse this privilege, jumping back and forth across the border, making faces at the poor wretches stuck on one side and taunting the guards who had no right to stop his antics. He mentioned nothing of the sort, true, but that's just the kind of thing one might choose to keep to oneself.

   1082147|00000000||<i>Your package? Your brother picked it up. You know, you two're damn near identical... Hey! Where you running off to?!</i><br>– Hanne Kluger, postmaster<br><br>Dopplers, also known as vexlings or changelings, are beings able to take on the form of any humanoid or animal they please. This transformation is no mere illusion able to be shattered with a simple spell, but an authentic and complete metamorphosis. This means no protective amulets or witcher medallions will signal a doppler's presence - they emanate the same aura as the being whose form they have assumed. This, combined with their incredible intellect and cunning, would make dopplers supreme assassins or thieves - had not nature endowed them with generous and timid spirits which make them avoid the shedding of blood at all costs.
   1082148|00000000||When backed into a corner, dopplers can present a grave danger by taking on the form of their assailant - and along with it his strengths and abilities. The sum result is to force the assailant to battle against himself - a battle few can win.<br><br>Like other relicts, dopplers are extremely vulnerable to silver, and so a silver sword should be used when fighting them. Silver has the additional useful property of forcing a doppler to change form on contact.

   1061645|00000000||The youngest among the witchers of Kaer Morhen, and perhaps the last ever trained within its walls, by the start of our tale Lambert had proven his chops many times over, having hunted down many a mighty beast and traversed nearly all the Continent's realms several times over.<br><br>Yet he had also developed a reputation for arrogance and sardonic humor, and his gruff and at times excessively blunt manner could irritate even his fellow witchers of the School of the Wolf. Whatever his vices, it went without saying that Lambert would brave the fires of any hell for his companions.<br>
   1061646|00000000||If destiny truly chooses which boys become witchers, then in Lambert’s case it had made a twisted, cruel choice. After hearing his story, Geralt had to admit that Lambert had every reason to be unenthused about the lot fate had granted him.<br>
   1061647|00000000||A chance encounter of two witchers hunting the same ekimmara turned into a tale of old friendship, murder and vengeance. The moral of the story? Don't mess with Lambert.<br>
   1061648|00000000||Though Lambert made no secret of his hatred for Kaer Morhen, when the time came to stand in its defense, he did so without a second thought.<br>
   1061649|00000000||Sadly, during the battle Lambert found himself overwhelmed by enemy forces. Relief came too late and he was cut down by the Wild Hunt's warriors.<br>
   1061650|00000000||During this battle he came within a hair’s breadth of losing his life. Luckily, Geralt arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers.<br>
   1061651|00000000||During this battle, he came within a hair’s breadth of losing his life. Luckily Keira arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers.<br>
   1061652|00000000||It just might be that Lambert and Keira’s later (and somewhat unexpected) relationship came about as a result of that moment, when they fought for survival at each other’s side. It is also possible it was a simple matter of two attractive people taking a liking to each other. At any rate, only time could tell what would become of the couple.<br>

   1053002|00000000||Geralt's travels took him to a certain village whose inhabitants were clearly anxious about something. It turned out they were expecting a gang of bandits led by a woman known as Little Red to attack at any minute. She was out for the blood of a certain Bertram who she claimed had wronged her. Geralt promised to help defend the villagers.<br>
   1053012|00000000||When Little Red's band attacked, it was clear the villagers had bet on the right horse in hiring Geralt. He made quick work of the cutthroats, collected his reward and went off into the sunset.
   1053020|00000000||When Little Red's band attacked, it became clear the matter was not at all as clear as it had at first seemed. The bandits' leader assured Geralt she did not want to hurt anyone except for this Bertram. The man had worked with her at one point as an informer pointing out who was worth robbing, but then turned and reported them to the authorities.<br><br>Faced with the choice of killing several people or letting one guilty man be punished, Geralt decided to let Little Red have her revenge. For that, he received a reward.

   1061839|00000000||Cyprian Wiley the younger was one of Novigrad's most dangerous criminals. He had inherited his father's casinos, fighting ring and brothels – as well as the old man's sadistic tendencies, ruthlessness and lack of scruples.<br><br>These traits had made the moniker "Whoreson" something of a family heirloom for his powerful criminal clan.<br>
   1061840|00000000||Cyprian also took after his father in terms of ambition. He broke the unwritten armistice between Novigrad's various criminal groups and tried to murder the other three leading underworld bosses.<br>
   1061841|00000000||Whoreson's audacity had a very specific cause - King Radovid, who had commissioned the gangster's actions.<br>
   1061842|00000000||As it turned out, Radovid's plan was for Whoreson to start a gang war in Novigrad. In the resulting chaos, Radovid would take control of the city with ease.<br>
   1061843|00000000||While searching Cyprian's home den of iniquity, Geralt discovered the nickname "Whoreson" was in fact an understatement - something much stronger was needed to describe a man who delighted in murdering captive women.<br>
   1061844|00000000||In addition to blackmail, extortion, murder and torture, the list of Whoreson's crimes also included trying to harm Ciri. Geralt took this very personally and made the bandit pay for this last sin with his life.<br>
   1061845|00000000||Though few would have mourned his passing, Geralt decided not to kill Whoreson. As soon as Radovid withdrew his protection and his old enemies were free to exact revenge, Whoreson's career was doomed to an inglorious end.<br>
   1061846|00000000||Whoreson's fate truly did seem worse than death. Abandoned by his protector as well as his subordinates, he had lost all his coin as well as any respect he once commanded, having fallen to the lowest depths of the Novigrad underworld.<br>

   1059652|00000000||The being trapped within Uma's tortured husk turned out to be Avallac'h – a powerful Sage of the Aen Elle elves. Geralt had made his acquaintance years before. Already during these prior encounters Avallac'h had displayed an intense and, frankly, rather unnerving interest in the Elder Blood and its bearer, Ciri. His exact motives were unclear at the time, and he had made no particular effort to explain them to Geralt.<br><br>Geralt likewise had no idea what bound Ciri and the elf now. There was no doubt Avallac'h had helped her, had saved her numerous times from the Wild Hunt – but why? Alas, the Sage, quivering on a razor's edge between life and death, offered no answers to Geralt's burning questions.<br><br>He did, however, muster enough strength to utter a crucial piece of information – Ciri's location.<br>
   1059655|00000000||When Geralt got a chance to talk to Ciri about Avallac'h, he learned that the Sage had been her tutor and mentor for some time. They were bound by a common enemy. Avallac'h had been the chief advisor to the previous ruler of the Aen Elle, whose demise had precipitated a conflict between Avallac'h and the successor, Eredin. The Sage had thus made it his mission to protect Ciri from his new king's malicious designs, whatever the cost.<br><br>Ciri made it clear to Geralt that she trusted the Sage. He had saved her life on numerous occasions – including when, feeling the onset of the curse that would transform him into Uma, he resolved to hide her form the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists.<br>
   1059666|00000000||Avallac'h played a key role in staving off defeat during the defense of Kaer Morhen. After the battle, he advised the witcher that ultimate victory over Eredin and his ghastly cavalcade would only be possible with magic assistance. That meant Geralt would have to once again pact with members of the infamous Lodge of Sorceresses...<br>
   1059667|00000000||Seizing the calm before the storm, Avallac'h tried once more to teach Ciri to control her incredible talent. He soon found that Ciri was as stubborn a pupil as she was gifted - something that Geralt had discovered for himself much earlier.<br>
   1059669|00000000||Drawing on his knowledge of internal Aen Elle politics and the strengths and weaknesses of the Wild Hunt's commanders, Avallach crafted a plan to eliminate one of Eredin's most powerful allies - his master of manipulation, Ge'els.<br><br>In order to accomplish this, Avallac'h was willing to do anything - even risk a dangerous journey to Tir ná Lia.<br>
   1059676|00000000||Geralt's trip to Avallac'h's laboratory confirmed that the Sage was interested in Ciri and her genealogy.<br>
   1059677|00000000||Based on the notes found in Avallac'h's secret laboratory, it seemed the Sage had been researching Lara Dorren's gene for over two centuries. Clearly the elves were investigating the possibility of producing a child with extraordinary abilities – like those which Ciri possessed.<br>
   1059687|00000000||The elf they stumbled across in Avallac'h's laboratory claimed his interest in Ciri was purely pragmatic and that he secretly loathed her for the human blood in her veins. Was Avallac'h truly so two-faced - or was the mysterious she-elf merely twisting his words to hurt Ciri?<br>
   1059688|00000000||Avallac'h remained shockingly unperturbed when he heard Geralt and his companions had visited his secret laboratory. He openly admitted that he was interested in Lara's bloodline and in protecting her descendants.<br>
   1059691|00000000||When it was suggested that he was more interested in controlling Lara's bloodline and her descendant - namely Ciri - the Sage reacted coldly, curtly dismissing such insinuations.<br>
   1059692|00000000||When they brought up the she-elf they came across in his lab, Avallac'h reacted with mild amusement, as if that particular subject was not worth treating seriously.<br>
   1059695|00000000||The witcher considered the matter and decided Avallac'h could be trusted.<br>
   1059697|00000000||Avallac'h played an active role in the war council preceding the luring of the Wild Hunt into their trap. During these discussions he and Ciri briefly got into a heated argument because Avallac'h firmly insisted she not engage directly in the coming conflict.<br>
   1059708|00000000||Eredin's last words sowed seeds of doubt in Geralt's heart, and Ciri and Avallac'h's sudden disappearance led them to spring into thorny shoots. Everything seemed to indicate that the Sage had been pursuing a hidden goal the whole time – to open the gates between worlds.<br>

   1053413|00000000||While poking around in the forgotten recesses of Kaer Morhen, Geralt happened across an illusory wall. He removed the illusion and behind it found a copy of the tome "Monstrum, or A Portrayal of Witchers." This tract had caused him no end of trouble and he would have tossed it onto the fire at once - if not for the intriguing handwritten note on the first page...<br>
   1053415|00000000||Geralt followed the directions found in the tome's notes and arrived at an old iron mine. After dispatching an earth elemental guardian, he found the tome could be used as a sort of key opening a passageway leading to an old forge. To his great surprise, this forge began speaking to him. Though some might suspect the witcher had merely breathed a bit too much of the musty mine air, he claimed an ifrit, a fire elemental of some kind, had been used ages ago by a mage who created special equipment for the Wolf School witchers. This elemental remained vigilant all these years after the mage's death and thus Geralt had to defeat it in order to get at the secret stash of high-quality gear hidden behind the forge.

   1056256|00000000||It turned out that, while Avallac'h had not been entirely honest with the witcher, he was no traitor. Ciri had slipped off with him during the battle of her volition in order to - and please pardon the grandiosity, dear reader - save the world. She was convinced Geralt would never allow her to embark on this mad endeavor, and so decided she had to operate behind his back. All his promises and threats were for naught - there was no stopping Ciri once she'd made her mind up. The witcher could only watch as she stepped into the elven tower - and hope she would return safe and sound.
   1084951|00000000||Eredin's words rang in Geralt's ears. Could Avallac'h truly have betrayed them? Could Ciri still be in danger, even with the Wild Hunt destroyed once and for all? Without a moment to lose and paying no heed to their wounds or exhaustion, Geralt and Yennefer plunged back into the post-battle chaos ravaging Undvik.

   1072919|00000000||Geralt was not expecting to meet Bernard Ducat, former head of Temerian intelligence, in such circumstances. Their relationship went back a long ways, to the time when Ducat was leading an espionage operation in the Vizima Temple District disguised as a fence named Thaler. Thaler the fence was known for his gruff manners and extremely filthy tongue.<br><br>Much had changed since those days, but Clogs the cobbler (as Ducat now called himself) was as rude and vulgar as Thaler had ever been.<br><br>His exact role in the attack on Radovid was not clear, but considering his experience and professionalism, one could hardly expect him to share that information, not even with an old friend.<br>
   1072932|00000000||Spycraft leaves no margin for error, sentiment or dropping one's guard. Thaler died in a violent bout of political maneuvering when it turned out his plans conflicted with the greater good of Redania.<br>
   1072933|00000000||Spycraft leaves no margin for error, sentiment or dropping one's guard. Thaler should have known this, but instead he left himself exposed and only escaped death thanks to Geralt's intervention, his life saved by the witcher's departure from his usual neutrality.

If so, that time is now long past. The Skelligers whose demolished wagon Geralt stumbled across in the middle of  the Ard Skellig forest learned this the hard way. The poor souls had stood no chance against the cyclops who butchered them.<br>
   1051133|00000000||Geralt searches nearly every corpse he comes across, and while I personally find this habit a bit morbid, I must admit he digs up some very interesting things in the pockets of the dead. This time, for example, he found a letter that he promptly delivered to its addressee - the smith at Kaer Trolde. It was from the smith's departed sister. Though it cast the man into deep mourning, he appreciated Geralt's deed.

   1049221|00000000||Those who stray off the beaten tracks in the bogs of Velen rarely live to amend their error. Even the Nilfgaardian soldiers stationed at the Army Group 'Center' camp would at times disappear in the marshes without a trace. After yet another patrol failed to return, the quartermaster of the camp posted a call for some brave soul to search them out and bring them back, or, barring that, at least determine their fate.<br>
   1049222|00000000||Velen might lack for many things, but one it has in great abundance: monsters. Travelers who stray from the trails crossing its bogs and woodlands usually end up butchered by some claw-riddled creature or another. Geralt was thus not particularly surprised when he came across signs of a monster attack in the Velen bush. The call of his witcher duty screeching in his ears, he decided to investigate the matter.<br>
   1076095|00000000||From footprint to muddled footprint, from one broken branch to another, Geralt retraced what had happened in the woods outside the Nilfgaardian camp. Oblivious to the danger, the Nilfgaardian soldiers had strayed into a wyvern's hunting grounds. Their thick plate did not stop the ferocious beast from tearing them to shreds.<br>
   1076096|00000000||Further investigation revealed this already rather gloomy story had an even gloomier twist. They fallen Nilfgaardians had not been wandering the Velen woods on a run-of-the-mill patrol - they had gone there to kill Redanian prisoners of war and hide their bodies. What they did not realize was that the monsters of the swamp could sense the stench of rotting corpses even through thick layers of soil - and never pass up the chance to feed on the dead.<br>
   1076114|00000000||Geralt passed the sad news on to the quartermaster and collected his bounty. The Nilfgaardians' love for order and organization might not make them very good lovers, but it does make them excellent paymasters.<br>
   1076115|00000000||The Nilfgaardian quartermaster brushed off Geralt's accusations of war crimes with a shrug of his shoulders. The witcher was disgusted by this response, but felt outbursts of indignation would not do much to change the course of the conflict, whereas a purse of gold would do a great deal to change his material circumstances. He thus took his pay and marched straight out of camp.
   1076116|00000000||The Nilfgaardian quartermaster brushed off Geralt's accusations of war crimes with a shrug of his shoulders. Though the witcher had most certainly earned his pay and needed the coin, he refused to accept the quartermaster's gold. Even a hired monster slayer has his principles.

   1055877|00000000||Geralt was far from the only person in White Orchard looking for a lost loved one. War had divided many families, including that of a certain villager whose brother went missing after the last big battle. Geralt was short on time but still agreed to help. You're surprised, dear reader - but you shouldn't be. The witcher might seem grumpy at times and downright cynical at others, but he rarely passes by another man's misfortune without seeing what he can do to help.<br>
   1055878|00000000||Geralt and Dune began their search where the missing man had last been seen: the battlefield. Yet while the witcher started the investigation, a mutt named Hussar who finished it for him. When the dog caught its owner's scent, it raced off, following the trail while barking its brains out and not caring one whit if Dune or Geralt were following after.<br>
   1055879|00000000||Geralt went about finding Yennefer methodically. He searched every inch of every field and dale near White Orchard. Though in the end it was not this searching that led to his reunion with the sorceress, it did lead another interesting discovery. He came across two wounded soldiers in a hut near the battlefield - one from Nilfgaard, the other Temerian. It turned out they had fled the field of battle together. Though they lived their in enviable harmony and confraternity, they warriors could not remain in the hideout permanently -- they needed food and a medic's help. The Temerian thus asked Geralt to put them in contact with his brother, Dune, who might be able to help.<br>
   1055880|00000000||It turned out the missing brother had been heavily wounded but had survived the battle nonetheless… saved by a Nilfgaardian deserter.<br>
   1055881|00000000||Sadly Dune did not return the Nilfgaardian's favor. Afraid for his own life, he decided to leave the man to a certain death.<br>
   1055882|00000000||Though reluctant, Dune agreed to return the Nilfgaardian's favor. He took the foreigner in under his roof, thus saving him from certain death.<br>
   1055883|00000000||Geralt found the wounded soldier's brother and conveyed the good news. This deed saved a man's life - and earned Geralt a few coppers.<br>
   1086611|00000000||As it turned out, Geralt was not alone in searching White Orchard for a lost loved one. The witcher also found the notice of a peasant who was seeking his brother. The brother had left home to take up arms against Nilfgaard. The forces of the North and the Black Ones had then clashed in a great battle near the brothers' home village, and the peasant had not heard from his sibling since.
   1086612|00000000||Though pressed for time, Geralt decided to find Dune Vildenvert and then agreed to help the man. Be not puzzled, dear reader, for though the witcher oft appeared a surly scoffer, deep inside he was a sensitive soul, unwilling to look upon human grief and dismiss it.<br>

    423008|00000000||Listen - Dandelion's missing. Any idea what might've happened to him?
    424983|00000000||Same thing that happens to anyone who steps on Junior's toes…
    486449|00000000||Meaning?
    486451|00000000||He's surrounded by splendid virgins who ply him with sparkling wine and pastries stuffed with nightingales' tongues.
    486454|00000000||Come, Geralt, what do you think's happened to him? I reckon he's at the bottom of the Pontar, trussed up with the strings of his own mandolin.
    486456|00000000||Lute.
    486458|00000000||Far as I'm concerned he might as well be rotting down there with a goddamn trombone.
   1061149|00000000||The Crone known as Brewess was the middle of the three demonic sisters in terms of age - but the first in terms of size. Brewess was said to be a master concocter of magical mixtures, and, in the more ghastly legends, was said to know over a dozen different recipes for human soup.<br>
   1061150|00000000||During the Crones' sabbath it turned out the sisters truly did feed on human flesh, cooking it up in infernal pots and spicing it with root from the cursed tree growing atop Bald Mountain.<br>
   1061151|00000000||In the end Brewess shared Whispess' fate: she was slain by Ciri's blade.

   1077609|00000000||<i>Course it reeks. Think they're called rotfiends because they smell like roses?</i><br>– Vesemir, witcher of the Wolf School<br><br>Rotfiends resemble decomposing human bodies that have been stripped of their skin. Their presence is given away by the overwhelming stench of the rot which gives them their name. Devourers are a particularly dangerous kind of rotfiend marked by an insatiable appetite for human flesh.<br>
   1077610|00000000||Rotfiends and devourers were once rarities, but in the present age of constant warfare and violence they have become a veritable plague, particularly around battlefields and in disease-stricken areas. Though they feed mainly on carrion, they will at times attack the living. They usually feed in large groups and thus present a danger to lone travelers – especially considering their speed, which is more than a match for a horse at full gallop.<br><br>The rotfiend's decomposing body is filled with gasses which are poisonous even to those who, like witchers, are immune to most other toxins. These emissions are also highly flammable, meaning any spark, not to mention a carelessly-cast Igni sign, can lead to an explosion. This is particularly likely after a rotfiend dies, when its body thrashes around in uncontrollable tremors.<br><br>Rotfiends and devourers feed in the twilight hours and at night, when they become much more dangerous than during the day.

    513378|00000000||Mentioned you wanted something from me.
    513379|00000000||I did. And still do. The cursed isle on Lake Wyndamer - you've heard of it, I'm sure.
    521130|00000000||The local peasants mumble incessantly about it, about the wraiths that haunt it. They claim none who go there return.
    520640|00000000||I managed to. But while on the island, I did sense something strange. How'd it come to be cursed?
    520618|00000000||How'd it come to be cursed?
    520642|00000000||That's what I don't know! I must break this spell, yet I've been unable to identify its source.
    520761|00000000||Gotta know something…
    520763|00000000||Scraps. The curse is somehow linked to the tower where Vserad, the lord of these lands, took refuge when Nilfgaard invaded.
    520765|00000000||Claims in the village are that peasants, desperate of hunger, sailed to Fyke Isle to beg for food. Met their end there, it was a massacre.
    520885|00000000||So, will you please help me lift this curse? You're so good at these things.
    520994|00000000||Oh, go already. I can't wait to see what you discover on Fyke Isle. Just be sure to come and see me afterwards. And… Geralt?
    520996|00000000||Hm?
    520998|00000000||Thank you.
    520990|00000000||I need to know anything else before I go?
    520992|00000000||No. That is all.
    520970|00000000||I'm off to Fyke Isle.
    521000|00000000||So, where'd you get the xenovox?
    521002|00000000||Found it in the mine, along with the lamp.
    521004|00000000||Thought it was part of the lamp at first. Didn't realize what I'd actually found until later.
    521006|00000000||Think it belonged to the elven mage?
    521008|00000000||Clearly. And I didn't even know the elves used them.
    520974|00000000||Where'd you get the xenovox?
    520972|00000000||Xenovox - never heard of that.
    520976|00000000||Never heard of a xenovox.
    520978|00000000||It works just like a megascope, but is far more portable.
    520980|00000000||Think of it as a magic box that talks.
    520982|00000000||They hard to build?
    520984|00000000||Extremely. That's why they're so rare. I certainly couldn't build anything like it.
    520986|00000000||So, no chance these xenovoxes'll catch on, with every mage using one?
    520988|00000000||Not the slightest.
    520932|00000000||How's the lamp actually work? I mean, do I just rub it or do I have to do something, uh, magical?
    520934|00000000||You needn't even rub. Just place it where you find bones and hear whispers. Ehm… I suppose I should warn you - it might not be the most pleasant experience.
    520936|00000000||Figured as much. Tell you all about it later, maybe skip the drastic bits.
    520938|00000000||You'll need to do neither. I'll give you a xenovox. It's a bauble that will let us speak over some distance.
    520940|00000000||You will tell me what you see, and I shall tell you what to do and look for.
    520942|00000000||The magic lamp - how's it work?
    521166|00000000||Why won't you go with me?
    521167|00000000||Can't you just come with me?
    521284|00000000||I tried to go to Fyke Isle once. Thought my head would burst, the curse's magic was so strong.
    521286|00000000||Nice of you to send me there.
    521290|00000000||I experienced an acute nasal hemorrhage. You stand to endure a wobble of your medallion at most.
    521313|00000000||At Aretuza they trained me to detect even the subtlest magic pulses. This was like getting smacked across my haunches with a grain flail.
    521315|00000000||Funny, thought you'd go in for that sort of thing.
    521300|00000000||Take my boat. I left it on the lake shore, near the village. Should be fit to use.
    521302|00000000||Provided rot hasn't eaten it, as it seems to eat everything here.
    521053|00000000||All right. I'll help.
    520960|00000000||I knew you'd find it irresistible! Naturally, you'll need to sail to Fyke Isle.
    520962|00000000||Fine. What then?
    520964|00000000||Well, the spirits who wander the isle - you must establish a rapport with them, don't know how. But they could point us in the direction of the curse's source.
    520966|00000000||Think they'll be willing to chat?
    520968|00000000||Of course, provided you take my magic lamp with you.
    521199|00000000||I shall let you keep it afterwards, in appreciation. You'll find it quite useful, I'm sure.
    513388|00000000||I'll help you.
    437180|00000000||So the peasants who went to the island for food - this lord had them murdered?
    437186|00000000||The villagers say he had them poisoned.
    446924|00000000||A real gentleman.
    446926|00000000||Hm… I never met him, but he certainly didn't seem such a cruel man judging by what a mage from the isle told me.
    448846|00000000||A mage lived on the island? Did you know him? Where is he now?
    447499|00000000||We were friends. Sadly, he died that day as well. Very few survived.
    446940|00000000||Yet even those who escaped the isle soon suffered agonizing deaths. Strangely, they did not seem to have been poisoned.
    521023|00000000||Vserad had all the peasants killed?
    513500|00000000||Need to think about it.
    513501|00000000||Not too long, I trust. If you've any questions--
    520786|00000000||…I'll know where to find you.
    520788|00000000||Ughh…
    513389|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    520684|00000000||Why do you want to lift the curse?
    520716|00000000||Why're you so intent on this?
    520718|00000000||I'm not, the local peasantry is. "The isle, miss! You've got to lift the charm! You're a good witch, a great witch!" There's no end to it.
    520720|00000000||Uh-huh. See, I thought you didn't care for the locals. The great witch you are…
    520722|00000000||I fail to lift the curse and they could conclude I'm not so great, not enough to conceal me from the witch hunters and risk getting sent to the gallows themselves.
    520770|00000000||What others think, your image - that's all you care about.
    520724|00000000||The point is… Listen, I didn't flee to these wilds just to stupidly get caught because some boor with grit under his fingernails grows annoyed with me.
    513508|00000000||This island that's cursed…
    513509|00000000||Prepared to help after all?
    513377|00000000||Said you had a request for me.

   1078489|00000000||You gotta give up this madness, Morgen. Mum's beside herself, saying that's not becoming of a Temerian, stealing from innocent folk. Bad enough you deserting the army like that, but to take to robbing...  And how're you even sure you aren't hurting our own by accident? What happens if you and your mates make a mistake? You ever think about that? No, you didn't, ever since you were a lad you always acted first, thought later - or never. But you ain't a lad no more, so put an end to this reckless adventure and head home.<br>
   1078490|00000000||Geralt found the camp, but the deserters refused to surrender their treasure without a fight. They attacked the witcher at once - which proved a fatal error. Geralt vanquished them without much trouble, searched the camp and found a sizeable cache of valuables.
   1087015|00000000||During his stay in White Orchard, a certain letter found its way into Geralt's possession. Intrigued by its appearance, he decided to read it first chance he got.

   1081896|00000000||<br>That is exactly the perplexing question faced by Geralt of Rivia. In the end he believed Salma and decided to let her go free - though he could not shake off the feeling that he might live to regret that decision.
   1083317|00000000||<br>That is exactly the perplexing question faced by Geralt of Rivia. The succubus Salma claimed she killed out of necessity, that she had had no other choice. While the witcher did have another choice, he chose not to exercise it and killed the succubus instead - figuring this would be the lesser evil.
   1086973|00000000||The witcher's investigation uncovered that a succubus named Salma was responsible for the string of killings afflicting the Novigrad city guard. This came as a surprise, for succubi do not usually commit premeditated, cold-blooded murder. This is not to say they are not dangerous: they will at times kill on accident, when carried away on a particularly gushing stream of ecstasy. At other times, they kill in self-defense: though they have the look of slender maids from the waist up, their supple limbs hide incredible strength. They are also invulnerable to fire, the Igni Sign included. They present witchers with an intractable dilemma: does this monster, who wishes men no ill yet all the same often causes harm, deserve death, or mercy?

    472591|00000000||The old woman looked much like the many other widows of Velen, though her eyes seemed to have seen even more hardship than usual. Perhaps that was because she was haunted by the ghost of her husband, who had died at war years ago. The ghost had asked the woman to bring her wedding ring to his grave. The cemetery was too far-off for an elderly woman to journey to, however, so she asked Geralt if he could make the trip for her. The witcher took pity and decided to grant her this somewhat unusual request.<br>
   1051208|00000000||Geralt took the old woman's ring to her husband's grave. Yet when he returned for his reward, she was nowhere to be found. Her did find her granddaughter, who informed him her grandmother had died years earlier and paid him for his trouble.

   1077514|00000000||<i>Aye, half-eagle, half-tomcat, just like on the lord’s crest. ‘Cept this 'un was carryin’ me dead cow ‘stead of a scepter.</i><br>– Griffin attack witness, name unknown<br><br>Griffins were once only found high in the mountains, where they would hunt marmots and wild goats. When humans encroached on their lands, however, griffins soon discovered a new source of much more plentiful and easier-caught prey: cows, sheep and shepherds. Though still wary of main roads and towns (where folk with the means to hire a witcher are like to dwell), these half-eagle, half-wildcat creatures have gone from rarities to oft-encountered pests known throughout the Northern Realms. Especially hated are the subspecies known as royal griffins and archgriffins.<br>
   1077515|00000000||Griffins mate for life and when their partner is attacked they will defend it to the death. For this reason they are often considered the embodiment of courage, loyalty and fighting spirit. This last attribute no one would deny them – when provoked, they will not cease their attack until they have torn their opponent to shreds. <br><br>Griffins find their victims using their extraordinarily perceptive sense of smell. After drawing near to their chosen target they attack by swooping down from great height. Their muscular mass combined with their swift speed mean this blow alone is often enough to end the fight. If, however, the victim survives this aerial assault, the griffin will immediately engage it in direct combat, making use of its sharp, curved beak and powerful talons.<br><br>The wounds it deals are deep and cause powerful bleeding. Even worse, griffins do not have any true weaknesses – except for their vulnerability to hybrid oil and certain kinds of bombs.

   1049674|00000000||The notes left by Hendrik, the Nilfgaardian agent, mentioned that Ciri had quarreled with some witch, and that the newt-stewer in question could be found near the village of Midcopse. Exactly where, Geralt did not know - and so he was forced to swallow his manly pride and ask the locals for directions.<br>
   1049679|00000000||The peasants of Midcopse were not overly talkative, but in the end Geralt managed to get enough hints out of them to find the witch's hut.<br>
   1049695|00000000||It turned out the witch Ciri had conflicted with might have been Keira Metz, who was living near Midcopse disguised as a village witch. Geralt had visited her before - but now he had to return to her isolated hut to ask about his ward.<br>
   1049696|00000000||Unfortunately, Keira had not actually encountered Ciri, and the witch mentioned in Hendrik's notes was nowhere to be found. Geralt's efforts were not entirely in vain, however. The sorceress had recently entertained an unexpected guest - a masked elven mage. This mysterious visitor was, like Geralt, interested in Ciri's whereabouts. Keira figured the mage would be where she had left him and set off with Geralt towards his hideout.

   1002608|00000000||When the devil cannot go himself, he sends a woman - and when a sorceress is indisposed, she sends a witcher to do her errands. That, at least, was Keira Metz's approach. Finding herself in a bit of a pinch, she asked Geralt for yet another favor. This time she needed him to track down a merchant's wagon which had been carrying some rare magic ingredients her way. It had never arrived, and she had begun to fear the worst.<br>
   1002609|00000000||It turned out these ingredients, while rare, had nothing to do with magic. They were simply delicacies, treats which Keira, accustomed to the finer things in life, pined for in her Velen exile. <br><br>Grateful for Geralt's help, she invited him to an elegant supper, during which he dined with her on these refined delights under the light of the moon. These romantic circumstances, combined with Keira's own considerable charms, must have beguiled Geralt - he forgot about the other women in his heart and gave in to the temptations of the flesh.<br><br>The delicious evening had a bitter finale, however - after its conclusion, Keira put Geralt to sleep with a spell. When he awoke, he was unsure exactly what the sorceress was playing at, but he suspected it had something to do with the tower on Fyke Isle - she had asked him many probing questions about it while they dined...<br>

Keira had hoped this pleasant evening would be capped off with a romantic finale, but Geralt did not share this desire. And so, rather than indulge in the pleasures of the flesh, they lay back and admired the stars... until, that is, Keira quite unexpectedly put Geralt to sleep with a spell. When he awoke, he was unsure exactly what the sorceress was playing at, but he suspected it had something to do with the tower on Fyke Isle - she had asked him many probing questions about it while they dined...

They were simply delicacies, treats which Keira, accustomed to the finer things in life, pined for in her Velen exile. Though she offered to share these delights with Geralt, the witcher refused. Experience had taught him sorceresses never do anything without an ulterior motive.<br>
   1087101|00000000||It turned out the ingredients were indeed rare, but had not one speck of magic about them. They were simply delicacies and treats for which Keira had been longing in her rough rural exile. She graciously offered to share these delights with Geralt, inviting him to an elegant dinner for two. Geralt accepted the invitation, but in the end stood the sorceress up. Oh well, his loss - for a sumptuous feast spiced with a touch of female magic can be wonderful thing indeed...

   1222984|00000000||It is often said the darkest recesses of caves play home to the Continent's most fearsome monsters against which there is little of hope of victory or escape. The lone solution, then, is to seal them off from the world with the hope that they shall forever remain buried.<br><br>A certain priest of the Eternal Fire, however, learned that hope and prayer is sometimes not enough. The cavernous mine within Devil's Pit holds a specter whose very existence is believed to breed pestilence. With the threat of its release now imminent, the cleric seeks a new solution – the aid of a witcher.
   1222985|00000000||The being that haunted Devil's Pit turned out to be a red miasmal. Whereas a plague maiden is thought to be a damned spirit—once human but now cursed to spread the pestilence—a miasmal, by contrast, is considered an evil force born from the concentrated collective suffering of plague victims. It has the ability to possess human bodies thus granting it corporeal form and a means to wreak havoc. This process, however, irreparably corrupts and damages the host, causing the miasmal to continuously seek out stronger, more durable bodies. What cruel irony, then, that a witcher's immunity makes the monster slayer a perfect shell for the specter to invade and control.<br>
   1223283|00000000||Fortunately, a red miasmal's power is not so absolute that it cannot be defeated by an experienced witcher – though even then only with considerable effort. The specter, once weakened, can be trapped with the Yrden Sign then expelled from the host's body with Aard, thus creating an opening in which to defeat it. Consuming Reinald's Philter offers an advantage by increasing the intensity of witcher Signs.

Yet right outside the city walls lies the Novigrad Wilderness - and whoever sets foot in it soon finds out that man's primacy does not extend past the city walls.<br><br>One of the monsters who made its lair in that thick tangle was an old, powerful leshen. It killed any who strayed into its territory with its species' characteristic cruelty: lacerating them with razor-sharp claws, sending strangling plants shooting out of the ground or feeding them to packs of hungry wolves. If not for its vulnerability to fire, the Igni Sign included, and the protection of the Quen Sign, one could wager not even the toughest witcher would be able to slay the beast.

   1077692|00000000||<i>If want us to break through this wall, we're gonna need twenty sappers, seven mules and a hundredweight of saltpeter. Or one golem.</i><br>– Vilmir Brass, foreman at Mount Carbon<br><br>Golems are mindless matter brought to life by a spell. They obey their creator's orders without question. Their boundless strength, ability to withstand pain, endless patience and the fact that they need not one jot of food or drink makes them the best servants or guards anyone could ask for. Once provoked, they will not tire of battle until they have either crushed their opponent or themselves crumbled into dust.<br>
   1077693|00000000||Defeating a golem is extraordinarily difficult: for obvious reasons it does not bleed, if feels no fear or mercy and it is invulnerable to fire and poison. What's more, a golem's body is as hard as the rock it is sometimes heft out of, so even a silver blade will barely wound it. The monster's only weakness is acid – a blade covered in acrid oil can thus increase one's chances for victory.<br><br>Golems use no weapons, for they have no need – their fists, weighing over a hundred pounds each, can crush solid granite with one hit. A blow from a golem should thus be avoided at all costs – there is no shield that can stop it, nor sword that can parry it. That is no easy task, for these creatures are able to move with surprising speed. Luckily, their enormous mass means they are not very agile – once a golem begins a charge, it cannot stop quickly, a fact experienced witchers use to their advantage.

Then along came Radovid, who shut down the university, chased the students away and positioned ballistae on the riverbank to shoot everything floating up or down the Pontar, swans included.<br><br>But there hasn't been a dark cloud yet that didn't have a silver lining. Yesterday I saw our brave soldiers sink a merchant vessel. It went straight to the bottom along with its crew - and its cargo. A shame about the men, true, but it would also be a shame to let all those goods go to waste.

At this time it was commonly known as No Man's Land. Why? Well, the emperor of Nilfgaard had not yet claimed it, Temeria was in disarray, and the Redanians had already retreated north. No Man had been left in charge, and he had proved a terrible ruler.<br><br>Geralt needed to find Hendrik, an imperial agent who had been working on Ciri's case, and to collect from him what information he had managed to gather.<br>

The witcher only managed to obtain a few perfunctory notes about his ward, though thankfully these contained some scraps of valuable information. It seemed Ciri had been a guest of the Bloody Baron, the self-proclaimed ruler of Velen, and that she had quarreled with some witch, presumably the one living near the village of Midcopse.

These are noonwraiths – the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible.<br><br>
   1077306|00000000||Noonwraiths are only known to haunt rural areas, and usually stay near the place of their deaths. They prey on peasants working in the fields or children playing nearby.<br><br>Noonwraiths do not bleed and are for the most part immune to the effects of Witcher Signs. They can create mirror images of themselves which circle their victims in a kind of morbid parody of a dance. This ghastly ritual drains their victims' life energy while adding to their own strength. Noonwraiths are also able to manipulate the physical world to a limited degree, kicking up clouds of dust which temporarily blind and disorient their opponents. <br><br>Noonwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force a noonwraith to take corporeal form, one must first trap it with the Yrden Sign or strike it with a Moon Dust bomb. Once the monster has regained physical presence, one can mount a fast attack with a silver blade, preferably one coated in specter oil.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are much weaker then than during the day.

With the help of Vesemir, whom Geralt had encountered along the way, Geralt picked up her trail, which the two witchers then followed. Yen had ridden north, traversing wild lands and battlefields at great speed. She was in a hurry. Perhaps she was in trouble…<br>
   1050762|00000000||Ultimately it was Yennefer who found Geralt. The one-time lovers had not even a moment to enjoy their reunion, for Yennefer insisted they ride to Vizima as quickly as possible. The emperor of Nilfgaard awaited them there. Though Temeria's former capital was but a few miles from White Orchard, the journey was to be rife with drama…

    346838|00000000||Go to the main hall.
    346837|00000000||Defeat the bears.
   1051105|00000000||With Geralt's help, both Hjalmar and Cerys had defied death and won glory, greatly improving their chances in the race for Skellige's throne. Crach decided the news was an excellent excuse to host a great feast, during which skalds would sing the praises of the young an Craites and tables laden with mead and meat would sway those islanders who were still undecided, convincing them to support this generous and powerful family. Geralt was also invited to the celebration, where he was to receive a token of Crach's gratitude.<br>
   1051107|00000000||A Skellige saying holds that at a good feast, blood and mead flow in equal measure. Sadly, it seems someone took the saying literally and orchestrated a terrible massacre during the banquet at Kaer Trolde. Between the third and fourth courses of roast ram, massive, enraged bears suddenly appeared amidst the merrymakers. Before the hooch-dazed warriors could draw their weapons, the animals tore dozens of guests to shreds, including most of the claimants to the throne.<br><br>Geralt managed to save most of the other attendees, but could do nothing to stop the torrent of accusations and calumnies directed at Crach once the dust had settled. The other jarls accused him of conspiring to put one of his own on the throne. If an Craite could not prove his innocence, his family would forever lay buried beneath a mountain of shame.<br><br>Hjalmar and Cerys immediately took action, each in their own way. If he wanted to investigate how the massacre had come to pass, Geralt would need to choose which an Craite to support.<br>
   1051108|00000000||Geralt decided to help Cerys. This was not surprising - her calm and systematic approach to the matter bore a strong resemblance to how the witcher himself conducted investigations.<br>
   1051111|00000000||Yet Arnvald got his just deserts when he was the one to die at the hands of traitors. The full measure of justice, however, had not yet been meted out - it was discovered that Arnvald had not acted on his own initiative, meaning the massacre's true mastermind remained at large. What luck, then, that Geralt and Cerys quickly found clues as to the treasonous murderer's identity. It turned out the culprit was none other than Birna, King Bran's widow and mother to one of the claimants to the throne, Svanrige.<br>
   1051115|00000000||Arnvald tried to save his life by fleeing, but he did not get far - for Geralt, accustomed to chasing down griffins and wyverns, outrunning a clumsy and panicked rider proved no challenge. Cerys interrogated him adroitly and got from him the identity of his patron. It turned out the culprit was none other than Birna, King Bran's widow and mother to one of the claimants to the throne, Svanrige.<br>
   1051118|00000000||In the end Geralt decided to help Hjalmar. Like him, the witcher felt there was no time to go over everything with a fine-toothed comb - they had to act now, while the trail was still fresh.<br>
   1051126|00000000||Their thorough investigation led Cerys and Geralt to an unexpected discovery. It turned out Arnvald, the an Craite family's hitherto faithful servant, had had a hand in the massacre. It was he who spiked the mead with the blood and herbs that caused certain guests to transform into bears. It was he who then tried to kill Geralt and Cerys in a most underhanded manner when they were close to finding him out.<br>
   1051128|00000000||Geralt rode off with Hjalmar to the Vildkaarls' village located in the wildest Skellige highlands. Young an Craite was convinced these mysterious warriors had transformed into the bears that massacred the Kaer Trolde feastgoers. It turned out his intuition had not led them astray. Geralt found a hidden passage in the village leading to a vast cavern. When they entered it, the whole gruesome riddle unraveled before their very eyes...<br>
   1051130|00000000||The dark legends about the Vildkaarls were true. Geralt and Hjalmar saw this for themselves when they got a hidden peek at a terrifying ritual in which a man who wished to join the ranks of this bizarre warrior society let a bear devour him alive. Geralt tried to get the druid who conducted the ceremony to tell him who was responsible for the Kaer Trolde massacre. The druid refused to answer - and Hjalmar showed that it was vengeance more than testimony that interested him. He killed the druid, who took the knowledge of his patron's identity with him to the grave.<br>
   1051131|00000000||Birna was tried by a council of jarls. Though Geralt and Cerys presented damning testimony against her, for a moment it seemed the sly widow would escape justice. In the end, the final nail in her coffin was pounded in by her own son, Svanrige, who sensed her lie at once when she denied the accusations. Birna was given the sentence she deserved and disgrace covered the name of the once-proud Tuirseach family.<br>
   1051141|00000000||Though Hjalmar was not able to uncover who stood behind the massacre at Kaer Trolde, the testimony he and Geralt provided clearly showed the hosts had not had a hand in it, and that those murdered during the feast had been properly avenged - thus clearing the an Craite family name of all suspicion. Crach and his children were still far from safe, however - the traitor responsible for the bloodshed remained at large, uncaptured and ready to strike again.<br>
   1087109|00000000||Crach's invitation was tempting, to be sure, but Geralt decided not to take him up on it. Instead of attending the feast and collecting his reward, he went off to pursue other, more important matters, such as finding the Sunstone and defeating Eredin.
   1087110|00000000||In the end Geralt decided Cerys and Hjalmar were perfectly capable of taking care of themselves without his assistance. Meanwhile he had more important things to tend to - ones tied to Ciri. He thus left Kaer Trolde and let the investigation into the massacre run its own course.
   1087232|00000000||Cerys had always struck Geralt as the wiser of Crach's two children, which is why he decided to go with her to investigate who was behind the massacre. Yet once he saw how well she was handling said investigation, he decided he was not needed there and left to tend to his own matters.
   1087233|00000000||Hjalmar was a man of action and it was this that convinced Geralt to cast his lot with him and his methods. They set out together to find those responsible for the massacre, but Geralt quickly realized Hjalmar could manage just fine without his intervention, so he left him to it and set about seeing to his own business.

   1055890|00000000||There were only a handful of nonhumans in White Orchard. One of them was the dwarf Willis, an excellent blacksmith whose wares attracted peasants from far and wide. Sadly, his forge had burned to the ground shortly before Geralt arrived. Willis suspected the fire had been started deliberately and asked the witcher to investigate this alleged arson.<br>
   1055891|00000000||Geralt is capable of finding a doppler in a crowded city or tracking a forktail against a pitch-black sky from five leagues off, so hunting down an arsonist in White Orchard did not prove much of a challenge. It turned out the culprit was a simple peasant who delighted in simple pleasures: vodka and the persecution of nonhumans.<br>
   1055892|00000000||In the end Geralt decided not to reveal the arsonist's identity to Willis. Perhaps it was the coin offered in exchange for his silence that convinced him, or perhaps he simply concluded the man was clearly the village idiot and shouldn't be punished for his deeds which, while dastardly, could not possibly have been done with much deliberation and forethought - for the man was capable of neither.
   1055893|00000000||Geralt brought the arsonist to Willis. The dwarf immediately summoned Nilfgaardian soldiers - with whom it turned out he was on quite good terms. The imperials quickly declared the man guilty, handed down a sentence and carried it on the spot. Harsh justice - or maybe just harsh?

Not out of antipathy, but as a somatic premonition of the hangover sure to follow your drunken reunion. Seeing others, however, gives you an itching pain in your back and a desire to reach for your blade.<br><br>For Geralt, Letho of Gulet had a foot in both of these camps. This renegade witcher of the School of the Viper had the blood of at least two Nordling kings on his hands, the fruit of his cooperation with Nilfgaard's emperor, Emhyr var Emreis. Accused of these crimes, Geralt was forced to chase down Letho to clear his own name. Though both walked away from their final confrontation in the ruins of Loc Muinne alive and unharmed, Geralt did not think he would ever see Letho again.<br><br>It thus came as quite a shock when he happened across Letho in a barn loft somewhere in the war-ravaged Temerian borderlands.<br>
   1062449|00000000||It turned out Letho's former employer was less than satisfied with his performance and had set a variety of blood hounds on his trail. In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt, however, could not shake the bad taste left in his mouth by their prior interactions and went his own way, leaving Letho to clean up his own mess.<br>
   1062450|00000000||It turned out Letho's former employer was less than satisfied with his performance and had set a variety of blood hounds on his trail. In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt remembered the care Letho had given Yennefer and, in a show of solidarity, decided to help his former companion deal with his pursuers.<br>
   1062451|00000000||In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver – faking his own death. His plan would have worked perfectly, too, had Geralt's hero reflexes not been a tad overstrung, causing him to butcher any and all witnesses who might have spread the news.<br>
   1062452|00000000||In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver – faking his own death. Although Geralt had no forewarning of this, he improvised with aplomb and sent Letho's pursuers off convinced they had rid the world of a kingslayer.<br>
   1062453|00000000||After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. He and Geralt shared a brief farewell and then went their separate ways once more.<br>
   1062454|00000000||After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. Geralt proposed he hide out at Kaer Morhen for a while, and after a bit of thought Letho agreed.<br>
   1062455|00000000||Though some of Geralt's companions did not extend Letho a very warm welcome, the decision to invite him to Kaer Morhen proved wiser than Geralt could have known. During the battle against the Wild Hunt Letho proved his courage and valor while contributing to the victory over the Red Riders.<br>

   1083669|00000000||Geralt realized the fight against Eredin and his soldiers would most likely be the most difficult challenge he had ever faced. In addition, the stakes were higher than ever before - this time he was not fighting for his own life, but for that of Ciri and, by extension, the entire world. Since extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures, the witcher decided to swallow his pride and go to the emperor of Nilfgaard for help.<br>
   1083670|00000000||His talk with Emhyr did not go as he had wanted. The clash of two strong wills resulted in neither being able to accepted the other's conditions. The witcher thus walked away empty-handed.

Harpies, though - they like shiny things.</i><br>– Letho, Viper School witcher<br><br>It is hard to say what is most repulsive about harpies and their cousins, the shishigas: their hideous appearance, the overwhelming stench of rot and bird excrement that clings to them or their bloodcurdling screech. Suffice it to say that even rats, who dwell happily among the rankest fecal matter and rotten waste, give their nests wide berth.<br>
   1077903|00000000||Harpy nests are most often found atop high cliffs or rocky ravines. Sure signs of having strayed near one are crumbling human and animal remains, guano-streaked rocks and feathers littering the ground.<br><br>Harpies and shishigas hunt in flocks consisting of a handful to up to twenty individuals. Though rather cowardly and cautious, harpies fiercely defend their nests and will not hesitate to attack when outnumbering their foes. <br><br>During combat they use their ability to fly to dive swiftly to strike their victims one by one before soaring back up out of reach. They can kill with their wings or their sharp beak and talons. Once on the ground they move slowly and clumsily, and thus no longer present much of a threat.

   1048618|00000000||Geralt found the last Crone in the swamp village and killed her.

But if your cart throws an axle and you get stuck out there... Well, close your eyes and pray to Melitele.</i><br>– Kurt Hammerbach, city guardsman in Vengerberg<br><br>A lone nekker is harmless. Five are dangerous. Ten can kill even a veteran monster slayer. Particularly troublesome are the larger, stronger individuals known as warriors, as well as the rare breed of nekkers known as phoocas.<br>
   1077849|00000000||Nekkers and phoocas live in the dark woods that grow in damp, mist-filled valleys, in colonies of one to several dozen individuals. They dig deep burrows for lairs and connect them with a network of narrow tunnels. Using these passageways they are able to move at great speed within and around their colonies.<br><br>Nekkers always attack in groups and by surprise. They try to surround their prey as quickly as possible, cutting off all escape routes. Luckily their attack is for the most part disorganized, for nekkers are not gifted with great courage and individual nekkers will often hesitate before overcoming their fear and striking. When fighting them one can use this moment of hesitation to kill the braver individuals before finishing off those who remain in the back.

   1049525|00000000||A magic cataclysm had devastated a large part of the isle of Ard Skellig, and Yennefer suspected Ciri had had something to do with it. The raven-haired sorceress thus set out with Geralt to the isle's mysteriously deformed woods to look for signs of their one-time ward's presence.
   1060562|00000000||Yennefer was not mistaken. Ciri had indeed been in Skellige. With her was a mysterious mage, and chasing them both - the Wild Hunt. When Ermion heard this, his first thought was of the Hunt's recent attack on the isle of Hindarsfjall - perhaps it, too, was connected to Ciri. Geralt and Yennefer set off at once to investigate this new lead.

   1073177|00000000||Mh. There.
   1048598|00000000||In the mission to gather the members of the former Lodge of Sorceress, it fell to Yennefer to bring Margarita Laux-Antille to Novigrad. Yennefer's old friend had been captured by the witch hunters and was being kept in Deireadh, the best-guarded prison this side of the Yaruga.<br><br>Geralt and Yennefer thus had a hard endeavor in front of them - they would have to break into the sealed compound and sneak Margarita out. Good thing Yen had something even better than a file in a carrot cake: contact information for the one man who had managed to escape Deireadh. Escaping seemed to be in his blood, for he attempted to make another getaway at the sight of Yennefer and Geralt, but eventually they caught him and sat down for a chat. He told them how to outfox the guards and enter the prison unnoticed. With no time to waste, Geralt and Yennefer raced off to Margarita's rescue.<br>
   1048600|00000000||When Geralt reached the cell in which Margarita was held, he uncovered a shocking surprise. Rita was not alone in her cell: Síle de Tansarville lay there as well, clinging to life with the last scraps of her strength. It turned out she had been captured long before Margarita and her body had been broken by the constant torture she'd undergone since. Síle had only one last wish - she wanted to depart this world in dignity, and so asked Geralt to end her suffering.<br>
   1048601|00000000||Geralt did not kill Síle de Tansarville. What prompted this decision? I do not know and quite possibly will never find out. Perhaps his nerves failed him, or perhaps he simply did not want another sorceress' blood on his hands. As for Síle, she saw only cruelty in his actions and cursed him for leaving her to die in agony in the miserable confines of a dank Deireadh cell. Then Yennefer took matters into her own hands - and ended Síle's life.
   1048602|00000000||Geralt granted Sile's last request and ended her pain with one expert blow. Though they had not always enjoyed the best of relations, he felt this had to be done, as no one deserved to die a slow and painful death in a dank Deireadh cell.<br>
   1051069|00000000||With their powers combined, Yennefer and Geralt freed Margarita from the most formidable prison in the North. Rita was in a very sorry state, but the knowledge that she was free and would not perish on a pyre fortified her strength. Yennefer showered her long-time friend with tender care, and everyone hoped for a swift recovery.

   1085075|00000000||Skellige Woman
   1078102|00000000||Last week the three of us grabbed this traveler. Looked like the kind of cowardly fuck starts shitting his breeches at the first sight of you. But seems looks can be deceiving. Bastard started waving a sword, cut my ear off and sliced Olaf's arse so deep he's got an extra crack, except the new one's horizontal. Then he smacked Ivar in the forehead with the hilt. Poor sod's still dizzy.<br><br>We snuffed him in the end, of course - every fellow's doomed when he's outnumbered. But it turned out he had a handful of coins in his pouch, a copper ring on his finger - and that's it. We lost out on that robbery - paid more to the herbalist for patching up than we took from the whoreson. So afterwards Olaf said, "Why the devil risk our necks waiting around for travelers, when gold's literally sitting right under our feet - buried with the dead?" A corpse can't defend itself, so the risk of injury's nil. No need to wait around all day till someone walks by - there's already a couple dozen someone's waiting for us, lying in their graves, each one marked out like veg at a grocer's.<br><br>So I gave it a good think and concluded Olaf's talking sense. So starting tomorrow we're going to stay off the roads and do our looting in the graveyard instead.<br>
   1078103|00000000||It turned out robbing corpses was not the gold mine Olaf and his crew had imagined. The witcher, though, made a tidy profit off their "labors".
   1087011|00000000||Unwary visitors to cemeteries just might find their stay prolonged indefinitely. The dead don't always like having their rest disturbed, while necrophages never like having their meals interrupted. One time, the witcher happened across just such a group of underprepared, or possibly simply unlucky, cemetery-goers. One of them had been carrying notes of some kind. Driven by curiosity and, I must surmise, a lack of anything better to do at that precise moment, Geralt set about reading the sloppily-written document...

    168444|00000000||Hm?

   1055887|00000000||Many think that the life of a witcher consists of nothing but adventure after grand adventure, an endless stream of contracts on manticores, bruxae and other exotic beasts. In truth, Geralt would often take on more banal tasks, ones lesser bards fear mentioning, for they lack the skill required to make a masterwork of the mundane. By way of example, once in White Orchard he was hired to retrieve a woman's... frying pan.<br>
   1055888|00000000||Geralt found the frying pan and returned it to the old woman. She was overcome with joy and gratitude - not only did she have her precious cooking utensil back, but someone had scrubbed it clean for her as well!
   1055889|00000000||A mysterious gentleman had borrowed the frying pan from a little old lady and not returned it. While investigating this damned unneighborly act, Geralt discovered the delinquent borrower had other, more serious sins on his conscience... murder, for example. The half-burned notes Geralt found in his abandoned hut made it clear he was interested in the movements of Nilfgaardian forces and confidential military secrets - in other words, the man was a spy.<br>

   1055912|00000000||My story began in Temeria, near Vizima, with Geralt dreaming a dream of Yennefer, Ciri and the Wild Hunt. It ends in Temeria as well, with the witcher returning to Vizima to have one last conversation with the emperor - and tell him Ciri would not be coming back.<br>
   1050594|00000000||After his meeting with Emhyr var Emreis, Geralt set off for White Orchard, where he had agreed to meet someone amidst the ruins of the old castle there.<br>
   1055913|00000000||And who awaited Geralt in White Orchard? Ciri - packed and ready to set off on the Path. Where did the witcher and his ward venture, you ask, and what became of them? That, dear reader, is another story.<br>

   1037309|00000000||Welcome to our humble forge. How can we be of help?
   1033428|00000000||Looking for someone who can craft me some armor. Gotta be top quality.
   1033462|00000000||Strong and light will do just fine.
   1033477|00000000||Comfortable, strong and light'll do just fine.
   1030742|00000000||Got the tools.
   1030743|00000000||Went to Undvik a while ago. Found these.
   1033856|00000000||Unimportant. What matters is I got 'em.
   1033870|00000000||Long story… Might tell it some day, but right now I need that armor.
   1033919|00000000||What about my armor?
   1033930|00000000||Can't turn away a Nilfgaardian general, I get it… But hope it doesn't mean you've forgotten about my armor.
   1033932|00000000||We haven't. Well, I haven't, and won't. 'Cause I'll be the one to make it, understand? And the Nilfgaardian's armor. And every other suit he agrees to make.
   1033971|00000000||Gotta say - hard to believe.
   1034083|00000000||Gotta admit, find your story hard to believe myself…
   1034095|00000000||I'll prove it to you. Fergus can make the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll craft another suit. We'll see who's is better.
   1030860|00000000||Lemme think about it.
   1030870|00000000||Hmm… Need to think about it.
   1030871|00000000||I see. Well, I've work to do. But should you decide to help me… I'd craft armor for you, lots of it. The kind no other armorer can.
   1030861|00000000||Bound to be a notice posted for the griffin anyway. Could kill two beasts with one stone. Fine, I'll see what I can do.
   1030869|00000000||Bring me the acid, and I'll prove I'm better than Fergus. And I'll craft armor for you, lots of it, the kind no other armorer can.
   1030859|00000000||Fine. I'll bring you acid.
   1034238|00000000||I need but one thing I can't get on my own. Would you help me?
   1034239|00000000||Depends what it is.
   1034240|00000000||To finish the armor, I'll need to harden it, quench it in a bath. Oil's what we usually use, but I want to use acid.
   1034275|00000000||Hmm… Kikimores and archgriffins spit acid.
   1034285|00000000||Archgriffins? Draconic griffins, you mean? Baron's men came by a few days back. Said they'd seen one north of Crow's Perch. It'd killed some folk out there.
   1034033|00000000||If that's the case, stand your ground. Don't let him treat you like this.
   1034041|00000000||I won't, not anymore. He can craft the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll make another suit, and we'll see which one's better.
   1033969|00000000||Shouldn't allow it.
   1033938|00000000||Hmm… So what's Fergus do?
   1033940|00000000||Horseshoes, nails… Not much else he can do, seeing as he cocks up simple bungs.
   1033961|00000000||But in the end, they call him "master." No one'd ever think I could be a skilled armorer - a human, and a woman to boot. A dwarven blacksmith - that's another story…
   1033928|00000000||Enough?
   1033933|00000000||They treat me like I'm nobody, the menial labor. Truth is, the Nilfgaardian, the one Fergus is kissing up to - I'll have to craft his armor. Yours, too, for that matter.
   1033918|00000000||Whaddaya mean?
   1033888|00000000||Harmon aep Groenekan, lieutenant general of the Second Mounted Army.
   1033890|00000000||Welcome to our humble establishment! A true honor to host one of such renown! I've heard the general's a connoisseur and collector of armor.
   1033891|00000000||This is true. And they call you a master of the craft.
   1033904|00000000||All too kind, sir, tru--
   1033906|00000000||I need a suit of armor. Heavy, able to withstand piercing projectiles.
   1033900|00000000||Piercin' projectiles? Bolts, you mean? Hmm, that ain't easy, needs a special alloy, temperin'…
   1033902|00000000||The new tools - we can do it! Stoke the fire, I'll ready the rest!
   1033912|00000000||Bold, your worker. You allow her much.
   1033914|00000000||Er, you know how it is, general. Good help's hard to come by. We should go outside, there's business to discuss…
   1033917|00000000||It's always the same! I've had enough!
   1033859|00000000||Wasn't easy. Sooo… I'm hoping for a good price - on that armor of mine.
   1033853|00000000||Wasn't easy, so I'm hoping for a good price.
   1030746|00000000||Well, goose kick me! These look like the real thing…
   1030747|00000000||Because they are - look at the markings! Authentic! How did you get them?!
   1030741|00000000||Forge was carved out of a rock face. Probably why it still stands. Tools were inside…
   1033574|00000000||Look for the tools next time I'm in Skellige. Take care now.
   1033563|00000000||Farewell.
   1033562|00000000||Know where the forge is?
   1033565|00000000||These legends mention where the forge might be?
   1033572|00000000||Yes, north side of the isle, in a cave. Clan folk carved out a rock face to build it.
   1030739|00000000||Worth looking into. Say I find the tools, will you craft the armor for me?
   1030740|00000000||Ahem. On condition you bring the tools. But only then.
   1033486|00000000||Oughta know one thing when it comes to armor: if it's gotta be durable, it can't be light.
   1033491|00000000||It can. Just needs the proper tools to make it. Tools like the folk of Clan Tordarroch used on Undvik.
   1033541|00000000||Yoana, I told you time and again to stay silent when I talk to customers. Shouldn't pester folk with those nonsense Skellige legends o' yours.
   1033543|00000000||It ain't legend, and it ain't nonsense. My granddad would go to Undvik for his armor, said Tordarroch folk made the best. Till last year, that is, when a giant ravaged their island. Inhabitants either ran off or died, but the forge should still be in one piece.
   1033475|00000000||Sounds great. Can you make a suit like that?
   1033485|00000000||No, but find someone who can, and I'll gladly meet 'em.
   1033461|00000000||Could it?
   1033413|00000000||Well, I've been at it twenty years, now. Mastered the craft in some respects, if I do say so myself.
   1033423|00000000||You wish…
   1033430|00000000||Don't listen to her. She's been sore lately, snortin' every chance she gets.
   1033432|00000000||So, what kind of armor are we talkin' about?
   1033449|00000000||Light but durable. Can't constrain movement, and I gotta be able to get in it without anybody's help.
   1033450|00000000||That all? Sure it shouldn't be self-cleanin'? And how about it wipe your arse after ye take a shite in the bushes?
   1030677|00000000||Need some armor, really good armor. Word is you're the one to talk to about that.

   1061358|00000000||Finally, after so many faint and elusive trails, Geralt had happened upon something directly tied to Ciri's disappearance. The Hunt had chased her and her companion to the shores of Skellige. There they had boarded a boat and sailed off into the unknown. A short while later, the boat returned, but with only one passenger: a twisted creature that, if a man, was very likely the ugliest in the world. The gnarled lump had found its way into Jarl Donar of Hindarsfjall's care, and so that is where Geralt went to next.
   1061359|00000000||Sadly, Donar had sold the misshapen thing to a passing merchant. The strange being had then been shipped off to Novigrad, and there the trail ended.

So the witcher ventured into the swamps, determined to find this bog-dwelling witch and ask her about Ciri.<br>

   1223157|00000000||Reinald's story is one of tragedy. A young witcher who trained in the early years of the School of the Wolf, who explored the world with a curious mind and an eagerness to help others, and who ultimately accepted a contract he would not survive. Possessed by a red miasmal and locked away in the mines of Devil's Pit by the very priests of the Eternal Fire who had hired him, Reinald displayed tremendous strength in resisting the specter's will. He imprisoned himself and the miasmal in a salt cavern where he would remain as his life slowly slipped into darkness and sorrow. The plague spirit's presence kept the witcher's body in a state of undying, while Reinald held onto the sliver of hope that his dear friend would one day come to his rescue. But days turned to weeks, turned to years, turned to centuries...
   1223158|00000000||Ultimately, Reinald's end proved no dark grim than the long road leading to it. Geralt defeated the red miasmal and burned the witcher's body, thus forcing his embittered ghost to depart the world.
   1223159|00000000||The wait ended at last with a conversation between the witchers and the young deacon. Geralt had defeated the red miasmal and convinced Reinald that even a cleric of the Eternal Fire was capable of recognizing the Church's heinous mistakes. After witnessing the deacon's sincere regret for the sins of his predecessors, Reinald was able to depart in peace.
   1223160|00000000||In the end, vengeance became Reinald's means of deliverance. He succumbed to the anger and bitterness that had swelled in him over these many years lost to time. By killing the young deacon from the Church of the Eternal Fire, the long-dead witcher cut the final tether that bound his spirit to this world, then vanished from the vale.

   1059069|00000000||When Ciri arrived in Velen, she found herself in the very heart of the notorious Crookback Bog. Exhausted, she sought shelter, but instead found herself in the clutches of three demonic sisters known to the local peasants as the Ladies of the Wood. Ciri quickly realized how poorly that name fit these bloodthirsty hags and fled. She escaped with her life by a hair's breadth, but still had a long and dangerous trek through the marshes ahead of her.<br>
   1059070|00000000||Crookback Bog is home to more than its fair share of horrifying beasts, but none of them hold a candle to the general of the Wild Hunt who chased Ciri now. Imlerith - for that was his name - had arrived on the Crones' summons to take Ciri back to his king. The young witcher was able to give her pursuer the slip, but the two foes were destined to meet again in the future.

   1061784|00000000||Geralt first met Keira Metz when she literally dropped on top of him out of nowhere. During the infamous coup on Thanedd Island, Keira was defenestrated and nearly landed right on the witcher's head. The next time Geralt saw her, in the swamps of Velen, was shocking in a different way - the luxury-loving sorceress was the last person he expected to see in such a grim and barren place.<br> <br>Geralt later learned the reason for this, and Keira's fate gave him ample fodder for contemplating the cruel whimsies of the wheel of fortune. Once the esteemed advisor to the now late King Foltest, she had been chased out of Temeria when she lost that ruler's trust. Later she joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, which earned her the hatred of Redania's king and Nilfgaard's emperor alike. Because of this, she had gone deep undercover, posing as a cunning woman, a village witch of sorts, deep in the Velen boondocks. It was not at all difficult to tell that she despised every minute of this.<br>
   1061785|00000000||Keira quickly seized on the witcher as an impromptu assistant. In return for showing him where a certain mysterious elf dwelled, she asked Geralt to help her retrieve a magic lamp from the nearby elven ruins.<br>
   1061787|00000000||Keira then asked Geralt for another favor: lifting the curse from the tower on Fyke Isle. Curses and favors being what Geralt does best, he obliged.<br>
   1061793|00000000||Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal.<br><br>Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation -and continued saying yes all evening.<br>
   1061794|00000000||Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal.<br><br>Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation for dinner - but, showing unusual restraint, turned down her other, decidedly unambiguous propositions.<br>
   1061798|00000000||Sadly, an evening that started out so nicely ended quite unfortunately for the witcher. Keira put him to sleep with a secretly-cast spell. Clearly, she wanted to hide something from him…<br>
   1061800|00000000||It turned out that Keira had played the witcher like a well-tuned harp, strumming all the right chords to keep him occupied while she stole the mage Alexander's notes from Fyke Isle. She was planning to use the notes as a bargaining chip while making a deal with Radovid. His plague research could be her ticket back to life without lice, ticks and omnipresent filth.<br>
   1061802|00000000||Though her planned move was as stupid as it was risky, Keira was deaf to all Geralt's arguments. In the end he had to admit he had no right to stop her, and so Keira left, taking Alexander's notes with her.<br>
   1061804|00000000||In the end Geralt succeeded in squelching Keira's mad plan to bargain with a man whose favorite negotiating tools were red-hot pincers and burning pyres. Keira changed her destination from Oxenfurt to the decidedly safer confines of Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1061806|00000000||Keira was determined to get her way, but Geralt could not allow her to carry out her plans. Both refused to budge, leading to a fight in which Keira Metz lost her life.<br>
   1061809|00000000||During the battle for Kaer Morhen Keira fought bravely against Eredin's minions and saved Lambert from certain death.<br>
   1061812|00000000||Later it turned out that fighting side by side had forged a bond between Keira and Lambert and they decided to continue developing it after the battle was over. This confirmed my theory that witchers and sorceresses clearly share some mystical mutual attraction.<br>
   1061813|00000000||Sadly the sorceress' desperate plans fell apart in the face of Radovid's cruel madness. Keira Metz shared the unhappy fate of so many of her fellow mages and was executed on Radovid's orders.<br>
   1061824|00000000||Geralt never found out why Keira had cast that spell, nor why she had expressed such an interest in Fyke Isle. Her execution, however, gave indisputable proof that her plan, whatever it was, ended in failure.<br>

   1061635|00000000||The Nilfgaardian Tavar Eggebracht came from a family with a long military tradition. His ancestors had proudly served under the Golden Sun banner during the conquests of Maecht, Geso and Metinna, fighting and dying for their emperor.<br><br>That last fate was met by Tavar's cousin, Colonel Tibor Eggebracht, who fell in the Battle of Brenna during the previous Northern War. Despite this fact Tavar felt no hatred for Nordlings, considering his cousin's death a grievous yet inevitable consequence of war.<br><br>He performed his duties as quartermaster diligently, with the good of his soldiers his top priority.<br>

    335786|00000000||Meet Zoltan in the Kingfisher Inn after sundown.
   1046082|00000000||Priscilla told Geralt about the ruckus I had supposedly raised at Whoreson Junior's headquarters, and that I had been planning to rob treasure from Sigi Reuven, a man better known to Geralt as Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence. Geralt now realized I was up the proverbial creek in a leaky boat without a paddle, surrounded by man-eating crocodiles - and he would have to swim to my rescue.
   1049910|00000000||Geralt had learned from the dreamer Corinne Tilly that Ciri contacted me while in Novigrad. He thus made his way to the Rosemary and Thyme, a charming establishment which I had inherited from an admirer of my poetry, for he, quite rationally, expected to find me there. His search for Ciri seemed closer to a happy conclusion than ever before.<br>
   1049913|00000000||Alas, fate had raised his hopes only to dash them cruelly back to the ground. Geralt did not find me at my proprietorship. His despair was partially lifted when he came across our old friend, Zoltan Chivay - but the dwarf had just returned from a long journey and knew nothing of my fate or that of Ciri. Concern wrinkling his brow, Zoltan helped Geralt search every corner of the establishment for clues about where I might be. Other than a few triflings, all they found was a planner containing notes about the women I had met with in the days prior to my disappearance. They divided the names between them and ventured into the city to find the women and ask what they knew.<br>
   1049917|00000000||Geralt conversed with the ladies whose company I had recently graced. Though each had fond memories of these encounters, none knew where I might be now. Geralt gleaned from their stories that there was one person who might know more: a famous and talented trobairitz named Priscilla.<br><br>It so happened this ravishing starlet was still in town and performing every night at the Kingfisher Inn. Like it or not, the witcher was in for an evening of fine culture, at the end of which he hoped to take the artist aside for a serious chat.<br>

   1051229|00000000||Near Novigrad Geralt came across a village whose inhabitants had themselves a bit of a ghoul problem. These nasty necrophages had taken up residence in their barn and posed a threat to the living. Geralt agreed to help the peasants - for commensurate pay, of course.<br>
   1051230|00000000||Getting rid of the ghouls did not prove much of a problem for the witcher. A few chops and slices and he was ready to collect his reward.

    564171|00000000||Awful pale, y'are.
   1078225|00000000||Soldiers have come. Whether ours or there's - don't know. Don't really matter anymore. I heard them riding down the road. Hid. Nailed the door shut. Maybe they won't get in.<br><br>They spent the whole night killing and raping. I saw it all through the cracks in the wall. Bit my finger to the bone trying to keep from screaming. Don't know if anyone else managed to hide. Maybe not. I saw them drag Antosh out. He had hid in the fields, next to the haystack where he'd stashed his things. They flailed him.<br><br>They've heard me. Know I'm in here. I didn't open up when they pounded. I thought they'd burn me out, just like they did those who hid in the granary. Then they got on their horses, rode off. Quiet, now. All I can hear's the flies circling the bodies.<br><br>I tried to knock open the door. Open the window. Dig myself out. Make a hole in the wall or the roof. Nothing doing.<br><br>I heard people who came to rob corpses. Don't know of what, all's left is soiled shirts and foot wrappings. I called for help. They didn't answer. Only ones who'll come now are the ghouls.<br>
   1078226|00000000||Sadly, the author of these notes, whoever he was, had quite accurately predicted his own future. Since his writing stated everyone but he had died, their was no heir left alive to collect the man's fortune. Geralt thus took it for himself. After all, he reasoned, he would make better use of it than the ghouls.
   1087005|00000000||While passing through a burned-down village, Geralt came across a body. After indulging in his bizarre habit of searching every rotting corpse that crosses his path, he found the departed individual had been carrying a set of notes written in a very unsteady hand. Figuring these might be the dying man's last words, Geralt decided to read them closely…

In order to defeat a penitent, one must remain in constant motion in order to avoid being struck by this agile creature, which can disappear and reappear in the blink of an eye to attack from behind. Most importantly of all, however, one must discover what keeps the monster bound to its haunting grounds - and break that bond as soon as possible.

   1051194|00000000||The Nilfgaardian and Redanian forces had fought many bloody yet indecisive battles in Velen from which both sides had to retreat without collecting their dead. On one such field Geralt encountered a group of looters robbing the corpses of the fallen. In another time and place he might have merely grit his teeth and continued on his way. Yet conditions in Velen were harsh and other sources of sustenance few - so he decided to swallow his revulsion and defend these desparate men from the monsters stalking the battlefield.<br>
   1051195|00000000||Hiring a witcher was one of the best ideas the looters' leader had ever hit upon. Geralt dutifully kept the monsters at bay while they completed their grim harvest.
    358211|00000000||Bitter Harvest
   1039532|00000000||Momentous decisions altering the fate of entire nations are often made under unusual circumstances. For example, when Geralt was asked to take part in the assassination of King Radovid, he was standing in a bathhouse in Novigrad, half-naked and staring at a sweat-soaked Dijkstra. If he agreed to join in, he was to attend a meeting in a warehouse by the docks. There the co-conspirators would hash out the details of their plan to kill the most powerful ruler in the North.<br>
   1039568|00000000||Their bold plan succeeded: the Redanian king was assassinated on the bridge leading to Temple Isle. Radovid's was not the last blood to be spilled as a result of this conspiracy, however. With no more common goal to bind them, the co-conspirators turned on each other.<br><br>Geralt, who has always cherished his neutrality, decided not to get involved and left the assassin's hideout before fighting began. Though Roche and his band had already overcome a great deal, it was clear they would not be able to defeat the overwhelming numbers of Dijkstra's thugs. Madame Irina's empty theater hosted a brutal spectacle in which the fiercest Temerian patriots met a bloody end.
   1039596|00000000||Their bold plan succeeded: the Redanian king was assassinated on the bridge leading to Temple Isle. Radovid's was not the last blood to be spilled as a result of this conspiracy, however. With no more common goal to bind them, the co-conspirators turned on each other.<br><br>Though Geralt has always prized his neutrality, he did not intend to sit idly and watch Dijkstra's thugs butcher his friends. And so the Redanian spy's long-awaited moment of triumph transformed into his final defeat at the witcher's hands.
   1087240|00000000||To this day I don't know what truly drove the witcher to take part in the assassination plot against Radovid. I also don't know what drove him to resign from this participation. Such are the facts, however: Geralt first courted high politics, then left them at the altar to fend for themselves while he saw to a more important matter: the fight against the Wild Hunt.

   1053411|00000000||In one of the now-unused bedrooms of Kaer Morhen Geralt found a note left by Berengar, a witcher who had once been his companion and colleague. The note indicated Berengar had been working on forging an exceptional sword called Tor'haerne. The note was sparing in its details, so Geralt decided to ask Vesemir if he knew something more on the subject.<br>
   1053412|00000000||The elder witcher told Geralt the story of how Berengar had tried to forge a silver sword with extraordinary characteristics. All his attempts, however, went awry and he lost the diagram while trekking downriver to kill a chort. <br><br>Geralt finished what Berengar had started: he followed the same route, killed the monster and retrieved the Tor'haerne diagram.

   1078214|00000000||I always said Musky was a clever pup! He understands more words than quite a few men. He can do all sorts of tricks - sit, roll over, and if you give him a scrap of bacon, he'll even shake your hand. But today, why, he's outdone himself today.<br><br>I look, and there's Musky, running in from the field carrying something in his mouth. I think, "Maybe it's a hare, and I'll be able to whip up a stew, sell the fur?" But no, it was a sack. All covered in blood, so no wonder he sniffed it out. I look inside... and inside there's a key. A little one, all engraved and ornamented, like it fits some fancy chest or box. So I think, "Maybe there's treasure hidden hereabouts, and that's what this key's for?" So I think I'll go for a walk, see what I can see. If I find it, I swear to Melitele, Musky's going to eat nothing but veal for the rest of his days!<br><br>That blood on the sack's got me a bit worried, though... But I'll take a thick club with me, so if anything pops out of the bushes, it'll get a thumping. You don't live but once, so you might as well take some risks, I always say!<br>
   1078215|00000000||Perhaps Musky was indeed a clever pup, but his owner was not the wisest of men, and his club didn't seem to have helped him much. Geralt's swords, on the other hand, served him very well. He hunted down the place where the treasure was hidden and, with no small amount of satisfaction, took its contents for himself.
   1086999|00000000||Geralt found a mutilated corpse which was carrying some notes. The blood which had soaked through the paper had not completely obscured the writing - and made the witcher all the more curious as to its contents…

   1059053|00000000||Geralt had been in situations where he could not prevent someone's death on more than one occasion. In fact, you might say he had grown accustomed to that particular form of agony. It is another thing altogether, however, to stand powerless and watch the unjust, cruel execution of an acquaintance for whom one has developed a fondness.<br><br>Such was his lot as regards Felicia Cori, a young sorceress whom Geralt had met while chasing the kingslayer, Letho. Though Geralt had not gotten to know her deeply, he had nonetheless taken a liking to this former pupil of Philippa Eilhart, who had seemed to him a pleasant and enterprising young woman. Yet she was a wielder of magic and, as such, met her end on a pyre.<br>

   1061848|00000000||The individual masquerading as Sigi Reuven was in fact none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, the former head of Redanian intelligence and a man Geralt and I had had many dealings with in the past.<br><br>He had fallen out of King Radovid's favor and nothing had been heard of him for many years. Now it seemed he had finally decided to emerge from the shadows, but instead of returning to high political wrangling he dove deep into the criminal underground - and quickly surfaced as one of its leading figures.<br>
   1061849|00000000||Though he did not show it, in his own way Dijkstra respected Geralt - even though the very thought of their last meeting brought a pained grimace to his face. The two had found themselves standing in each other's way during the coup on Thanedd Island. The stalemate was quickly broken when Geralt summarily broke Dijkstra's leg.<br>
   1061850|00000000||This spy's life story would make for a positively enthralling adventure tale. A victim of Philippa Eilhart's intrigues, he had been forced to flee Redania at breakneck speed - or have his own neck broken by assassins. For a certain time he sought refuge in far-off lands, but in the end he decided to return to the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061851|00000000||Well aware of Geralt's extraordinary talents, Dijkstra asked him to help find his stolen treasure. Though Geralt knew the identity of the criminal mastermind responsible, he decided not to divulge this information and set about investigating as if the case were a complete mystery.<br>
   1061852|00000000||Though the witcher's lips remained tightly sealed regarding my role in the treasure heist, Dijkstra still sniffed out his dishonesty - and made it clear how much he disliked being played for a fool.<br>
   1061853|00000000||Though Dijkstra did not aid the persecuted mages out of the goodness of his heart, Triss appreciated his support all the same, for it proved vital to the endeavor's success.<br>
   1061854|00000000||Dijkstra opposed the mage hunts sweeping the city, but for Philippa Eilhart he was willing to make an exception. He had never forgiven his one-time friend for betraying and then trying to kill him. Unfortunately, Geralt needed Philippa alive - and was in no mood to negotiate. He thus turned to a tried and true method - and broke Dijkstra's other leg.<br>

He had never forgiven his one-time friend for betraying and then trying to kill him.

   1072861|00000000||Anyone who thought Dijkstra had broken all ties with the world of political schemers and plotters was sorely mistaken. His great comeback was to be a patriotic act that would free Redania from the rule of a madman - the assassination of King Radovid.<br>
   1072865|00000000||As an experienced dragonslayer once commented, more than once heads have only rolled after the dragon's been slain, the mead broken out and the campfire lit, for when it comes time to share the treasure, hunters of beasts often become slayers of men instead. Such was the case after the assassination of Radovid, when Dijkstra tried to renege on the terms of their arrangement and do away with Thaler and Vernon.<br><br>Dijkstra counted on Geralt maintaining witcher neutrality in this matter - a miscalculation which cost him his life.<br>

And godlings, they are always the first to go. Such is the price we pay for civilization's forward march.</i><br>– From the preface to "The World We Have Lost," by Professor Dorregaray<br><br>Godlings (sometimes mistaken for lutin) are woodland creatures dwelling in burrows and moss-covered hollow stumps on the outskirts of human settlements. They are similar to children in behavior and appearance, and, like children, delight in mischief. Godlings are deeply rooted in their home territory and perform acts of care and guardianship to those dwelling near their burrows. They watch over people as well as animals, but, shy creatures by nature, they try to do so while remaining unseen. Godlings are drawn to joy and innocence, and so delight in the company of children and usually only show themselves to the young.<br><br>These hard-working and clever creatures gladly perform small services for those in their care, asking only for respect and payment in the form of food or cast-off tools in return. They are easily offended by churlish, ungrateful or simply rude behavior. Godlings also treasure their peace and quiet. When the village a godling watches over becomes too populous or its inhabitants forget the old ways, it will abandon its burrow for good and walk off to destinations unknown.

   1061618|00000000||Carduin of Kovir was once a wealthy and influential member of the Council of Sorcerers, a man known and respected by all the rulers of the North. After the Council imploded during the coup on Thanedd Isle, Carduin spared no expense in his quest to rebuild his brotherhood's hard-won position.<br><br>This motivated him to take part in the eventful summit in Loc Muinne, during which a handful of mages seeking to reactivate the Council were forced to accept King Radovid's patronage. After that Carduin found himself on the king's leash, completely dependent on the whims and moods of a mad ruler whom he served not out of respect but fear. The mage's pride, however, forced him to don a brave face and play out the hand fate had dealt him.<br>

    489114|00000000||I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.

   1033121|00000000||Nilfgaard has sailed for Skellige. Radovid occupies Novigrad. It's war, witcher.
    482544|00000000||Been to Vizima? The word is it's more like a pig sty than a capital.
    482560|00000000||The baths are in Silverton. I highly recommend you visit.
    482546|00000000||Calm down!
    482552|00000000||Are you mad?

   1058841|00000000||News of the Nilfgaardian army's approach led nobles of all ranks and orders to pack up their silver and flee posthaste to safer harbors, abandoning all thoughts of defending their patrimony and leaving their lands at the invaders' mercy. Lord Vserad was no exception to this rule. The magnate had ruled much of Velen from his base at Crow's Perch before fleeing with his family to take shelter in a tower on Fyke Isle.<br><br>The safety he sought there was not, however, to be found, and the massacre in which he was slaughtered became the source of a great many ghastly rumors and legends.<br>
   1058842|00000000||According to one of them, Vserad, unmoved by human suffering, had his mage poison starving peasants who had come to him to beg for food. A hideous tale, yet one that sadly seemed plausible given the desperate conditions in the land.<br>
   1058843|00000000||Yet the truth turned out, as is its wont, to be much simpler. Vserad was murdered by his traitorous former subjects, who were driven by greed, jealousy and the base jackassery that is all too widespread among the human race.<br>

    515647|00000000||I've heard of him. Though I'm not sure why you think he might be in my camp.
    515649|00000000||Heard some birds chirping. You've got some of the same friends. Both seem to count Radovid among your allies.
    512333|00000000||These birds, they're terribly talkative. I'll need to see them, you'll have to point them out--
    515652|00000000||Mhm. Meantime, Vernon, willing to help, or do I need to keep looking?
    515654|00000000||Hmm. As always, you've more luck than you deserve. I'm on my way to meet my Redanian contact. We're meeting near Oxenfurt, at a chess club.
    512334|00000000||Thanks. Knew I could count on you.
   1061658|00000000||Many cannot fathom the friendship Geralt of Rivia and I, Dandelion, have shared all these years. When we first began breaking bread together, spiteful tongues said he'd be better off cutting my throat and dumping my body in a hollow tree - before I provoked someone else into doing the same to us both. Those individuals spoke out of pure jealousy, for Geralt was my dearest friend, a fact which he gave ample evidence of on numerous occasions.<br><br>I could say a great deal about that world-famous monster hunter, the man known in Elder Speech as Gwynbleidd, or, in our younger (yet no less noble) tongue, as the White Wolf. For Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade - but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience.<br><br>On the surface, he is introverted, tight-lipped, one might even say gruff, but underneath lies an overflowing sea of goodwill, good humor, and an honest readiness to help his friends, be it with a bit of sound advice or the masterful application of his blade.<br><br>Setting aside cumbersome false modesty, I can say that I know his story better than any man alive. I was with him through hard times and good, helping with wise advice, warm words and razor wit. As a result, I am a vital part of his story, both in its earlier and present portions. It is thus my duty to continue my chronicle and, for the benefit of future generations, put in writing the next chapter of his deeds and exploits.<br>

   1051266|00000000||War had transformed the once-charming student town of Oxenfurt beyond all recognition. King Radovid had expelled the students and professors, and in their place had come shady characters of all stripes. For example, while there Geralt witnessed some such thugs pestering an Oxenfurt townswoman in a most unbecoming manner.<br>
   1051267|00000000||Geralt stood up for the woman, showing the louts who the real cock of the walk was. My friend might have been created to fight monsters, but I am glad he at times chooses to fight monstrous men as well.

   1051256|00000000||Though Skelligers are famed warriors able to hold their own in almost any battle, those whom Geralt encountered near the old mine on Hindarsfjall seemed to be in need of help. They had sworn to clear the mine of ghouls and were plucking up the courage to do so, but Geralt did not deem it likely they would manage the task on their own. When he proposed his expert assistance, they hesitated at first, but ultimately decided to take him up on the offer.<br>
   1051257|00000000||What tremendous good fortune it was that Geralt showed up at just the time and place where he was needed! With a touch of help from the warriors, he made swift work of that pack of nefarious necrophages and cleansed the surrounding area of danger, earning him the gratitude of all who dwelled nearby.

   1081547|00000000||<br>They say every journey made in the Skellige Isles ends in adventure. And sometimes, that adventure ends in death. Such was the case for the group of adventure-seeking Skelligers who set out in search of treasure in forgotten ruins - which turned out to lie in the hunting grounds of a powerful fiend known as Morvudd.<br><br>The witcher knew there was little room for error in a fight with such a creature. A moment of carelessness and the beast could hypnotize him with its third eye, then tear him to shreds while he remained in a trance. Morvudd was a particularly large individual, so one could presume fast attacks would not prove effective against it - and that its blows would kill anyone not protected with heavy armor or the Quen Sign.

   1058824|00000000||The Whispering Hillock - if the world were not as it is but as it should be, this name would denote a place of hidden nooks and lovers sharing heartfelt lies in hushed voices. Instead, it stood for danger and terror, for a place where wild animals, driven by some mysterious power, had killed many an inhabitant of Downwarren. Geralt agreed to investigate the problem, and soon discovered the animals were controlled by a spirit entrapped in a tree growing atop the hill. The spirit spoke to him in a woman's voice, and claimed to have once been a druidess who had kept watch over the Velen grove until the Crones murdered her and imprisoned her ghost in the tree. The forces of nature she had once served now protected her from the fiendish sisters' further designs. The unfortunate locals had died as collateral damage, for, the spirit attested, nature's wrath is unrestrainable and distinguishes not between unwary innocents and unwelcome ill-wishers.<br><br>The spirit begged Geralt to lift her curse and free her from her torment. In exchange, she promised to rescue the orphans from the swamp clearing, who would otherwise face a cruel death at the hands of the Crones.<br>
   1058828|00000000||These whispered words convinced Geralt and, following the spirit's instructions, he lifted the curse, transferring the druid's ghost into the body of a black mare. And so the spirit was set free, and the dark powers afflicting the Whispering Hillock were dispersed.<br>
   1058829|00000000||Yet too much innocent blood had been spilt on the Whispering Hillock. Geralt did not believe the spirit's explanation and destroyed its cursed heart. In doing so he expulsed it from this world for good.<br>

   1061627|00000000||It did not take long for King Radovid of Redania to prove himself a hard and ruthless ruler, one fully deserving to be styled "the Stern." His father, King Vizimir, was murdered when Radovid was quite young, and his mother, Hedwig of Malleore, and a Regency Council ruled in his stead.<br><br>Young Radovid soon seized power in his own right, however, and wrought vengeance on those who had treated him with disrespect. He took to forcing all his potential political opponents to swear allegiance – or face death.<br><br>He waged war not only against Nilfgaard, but also against mages, whom he saw as the root of all evil. Radovid also made every effort to gain control over the Free City of Novigrad, whose fleet and treasury could tip the scales of the ongoing conflict in his favor.<br>
   1061628|00000000||Geralt's meeting with Radovid confirmed the rumors circulating about the king's mental state. The Redanian monarch was a dangerous madman trapped in his own world of disturbing visions. This did not make him one jot less intelligent or cunning, however.<br><br>Despite his mental afflictions, the young king was manipulating his opponents like a highly skilled puppet master.<br>
   1061629|00000000||Radovid burned with particularly intense hostility (first kindled in his early childhood) for the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Rumors spoke of a special torture regimen he had prepared just for her. And while the two dozen points they mentioned were surely an exaggeration, they accurately conveyed the general scale of his hatred.<br>
   1061630|00000000||The terror of Radovid's reign had led not just his enemies, but also his allies and even his subjects to long for his death.<br>
   1061631|00000000||The phrase "monster in human flesh" fit Radovid the Stern perfectly. Perhaps it was awareness of all the cruel and bestial acts this madman perpetrated that led the witcher to get involved in the plans for his assassination.<br>
   1072934|00000000||Hatred for Philippa Eilhart proved to be Radovid's weakness. He was ready to do anything to capture her - even abandon the safe confines of his flagship.<br>
   1072935|00000000||The plan for luring Radovid out of hiding worked, though not without complications. Irritated by Geralt's typical cheek, Radovid brayed for the witcher's blood, and Geralt only dodge the executioner's axe thanks to the intervention of his co-conspirators.<br><br>Perhaps the  delay this caused was what allowed the ruler to nearly escape his assassins, but in the end he could not cheat fate and died at the hands of Philippa Eilhart, who descended suddenly, a veritable demon of vengeance, to revenge the wrongs he had done her.

   1078210|00000000||My dear papa,<br><br>The wedding's over. It's done. It didn't all go exactly like I'd imagined as a little girl, but, well, you always taught me to make the most of what I've got. We're traveling now, so I'll send this letter as soon as we arrive.<br><br>I'll start with what I'm sure interests you the most - financial matters. As I'm sure you've noticed, a few crowns have gone missing from your lockbox, the cupboard's a couple silver plates lighter, and your jewelry box isn't near as full as it once was. I took it. As my dowry. No doubt much less than you'd have given, had I but found myself a "worthy partner," but, tough, that's life.<br><br>Kurt – or, as you like to call him, "that good-for-nothing bare-arsed lazybones" - is now my husband. And your daughter's precious purity, which you cared about more than her feelings, tears or pleadings - well, it's only a memory now.<br><br>We'll soon arrive at our destination. Naturally, I won't tell you where exactly that is - just in case you get it in your head to come visit. Wherever it is, know your silver will be enough to set up a nice home. That's important - because I'm expecting a child. Are you glad? I doubt it. You always said poor matches only produce mutts and scoundrels. So it's a good thing you'll never have to see this one.<br><br>Your little girl,<br><br>-Jeanette<br>
   1078211|00000000||Geralt derived pleasure from the spirit of headstrong defiance found in Jeanette's letter to her father, and when he searched the place where her boat sank, this pleasure only increased. The woman truly had taken a sizable dowry from her old man.

   1060538|00000000||Few names in the Continent's history arouse as much terror and respect as that of Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd - the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. Emperor of Nilfgaard, lord of Metinna, Ebbing and Gemmera, sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro, he was ruler of half the civilized world and aspiring conqueror of the other half. He was a personage whose deeds and decisions shaped the fates of whole kingdoms and populations.<br><br>What then could he possibly want of a simple witcher?<br>
   1060539|00000000||The emperor clearly and succinctly laid out what he wanted. His daughter and Geralt's ward, Cirilla, was in great danger, for the Wild Hunt was on her trail. Geralt, a superb tracker linked to Emhyr's daughter by the iron bonds of Destiny, stood a better chance of finding her than anyone else in the world.<br>
   1060544|00000000||Thanks to Geralt's efforts, Emhyr finally had the chance to talk to his daughter face to face after long years of separation. Geralt doesn't know what topic was broached during their conversation, save that Ciri stormed out of it in a visible huff.<br>

The smoke pulsated, then gathered into an irregular sphere floating in front of the poet's head...</i><br>–The First Longing, a Tale Fantastic in All Ways<br><br>A djinn is a powerful air spirit, a condensation of the power of said element endowed with consciousness and character - the latter usually nasty. According to legend, djinns can grant even the most far-fetched wishes, though they do so begrudgingly.<br><br>Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings. A mage who succeeds in doing so can then draw energy from such a spirit, using it to cast spells without having to summon the Power from traditional sources. Only a handful have ever managed this feat, however, for djinns fight to avoid such a fate with stubborn determination. To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will, one must first weaken it - and that is no easy task.<br><br>Fighting djinns is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could never master with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating the element of air they can summon gales, powerful storms, even hurricanes. Luckily, as magic beings they are vulnerable to silver - yet steel will do them no harm.

   1054772|00000000||Novigrad was once famed as a place of tolerance and the rule of law. That is why it attracted mages from all over the world, those persecuted by Radovid and Emhyr alike. The Free City did not live up to their hopes, however, and rather than being a safe haven it became their slaughterhouse.<br><br>Triss Merigold, with whom you, dear reader, are already well acquainted, decided to evacuate all mages still alive to a place far removed from the front lines - Kovir. This was no simple task, and so the sorceress asked the witcher for help. Geralt agreed out of concern for the persecuted mages' fate - and Triss' fate most of all...<br>
   1050586|00000000||When it seemed the mages were finally safe and would set sail for Kovir's snow-covered shores, witch hunters swarmed over the docks and attacked their ship. Like setters who track down hares in even the deepest burrows, they had picked up Triss' trail despite her painstaking efforts to cover it. Luckily, Geralt stood in defense of the mages - as did, surprisingly, Dijkstra, for whom "love thy neighbor" had never been a guiding principle, nor the fate of the mages a matter of particular importance.<br>
   1054775|00000000||With the witch hunters taken care of, the time had come to say goodbye. Though much had bound Geralt and Triss in the past, on this black day, on the blood-slicked planks of the Novigrad harbor, their paths parted. Witcher and sorceress would, true enough, meet again on several occasions, but only ever as friends. Their flight from the Eternal Fire had been the last flicker of the fires of their mutual affection.
   1054776|00000000||With the witch hunters dispatched, the time had come to say goodbye. Geralt sensed his heart accelerate as he realized he might never see Triss again. The thought was unbearable, so before it could overwhelm him, instead of bidding her farewell, he asked her to stay. Though the circumstances on the blood-spattered docks were decidedly unromantic, in that instant all the feelings between Geralt and Triss came rushing back in full force.
   1075118|00000000||Nevertheless, Geralt was forced to abandon his friend in a moment of need, for other, more urgent tasks desperately needed his attention. If he later inquired after the subsequent fate of the mages of Novigrad, I doubt he learned much - the subject became a very sore one for Triss.

Our family's got a great many enemies. I've defended you against them, but now you'll be on your own. Perhaps someone will help you - and perhaps not.

   1053204|00000000||There are various ways to honor the gods: prayer, bloody offerings butchered on altars marked with pentagrams and donating to temples, to name a few. Skelligers, however, have their own, unique way of doing so. Since they value physical strength and warrior spirit above all else, they organize horse races in the goddess' name. Geralt decided to take part.<br>

    565804|ed1c2eda||Poor Man
   1062094|00000000||A witcher without a blade is like a potter without hands, and thus they are always on the lookout for skilled smiths to reforge or repair their deadly limbs. One day Geralt encountered a certain Hattori, a former master swordsmith who had transitioned into the premade edibles trade. He decided to convince the man to give up this dough business and return to his former practice. Little did he know this would be the start of a strange and toilsome adventure involving Skelligers, dumplings, shady ore dealers and, I kid you not, crafting supplies.<br>
   1062095|00000000||During this quest Geralt had to haggle like a fishwife, mix with mafiosos, draw with chalk in the dark and dive into a portside brawl. Most of all, he had to teach a lesson to the man who had squeezed Hattori out of sword making. All this so that Hattori would give up that infernal dumpling scrunching and return to forging blades. From then on our hero could make use of his services, and I sure hope he did so often, for otherwise all that effort was for naught.
   1086983|00000000||To a witcher, a sword is like a lover. He must carress it, care for it, devote some time to it each night. But as with lovers, there are times one comes across a specimen so superior and not one's own that one cannot help but consider replacing the old with the new. Geralt was fully aware of these principles, so when he heard about the legendary swordsmith named Hattori, a tingle ran down his spine, butterflies took flight in his stomach, and he resolved to find the craftsman.

The truth, however, proved far worse.<br><br>A water hag had made her lair in the caves beneath the cliffs of Kjerag. An old and experienced water hag. With powerful claws able to demolish any attempt to block or parry. And the ability to blind opponents from a distance, then strike with a lightning-quick counterattack.

   1051961|00000000||The thief's trail took Geralt to Novigrad's extramural paupers' district. The thought of venturing into that tough quarter makes me wince. Not so much because of the danger - I have braved much meaner places - but because of the smell, which can be so rank as to bring vomit to one's lips upon strolling within ten paces of it. Geralt, however, braved the worst and soon determined the imp was in fact a doppler, one who changed his form more often than other men change their knickers - although, given the hygienic habits of men in this particular district, that was not saying much.<br>
   1051962|00000000||The doppler had no choice but to seek salvation in flight. It seemed Geralt was in for a footrace.<br>
   1051963|00000000||Geralt has a soft heart. Though this does not always move him to mercy, this time it led him to spare the thieving doppler - under the condition that the shapeshifter leave the city at once. After that was settled, Geralt talked to the merchant who had issued the contract and brought the matter of the doppler thief to a close.<br>
   1051964|00000000||To this day I think Geralt did wrong in killing that doppler. In my opinion, his crimes did not match the punishment meted out to him - but, in the end, I am no witcher, and so it is not my place to judge. The merchant Sylvester was, unlike me, thrilled with how the witcher resolved the matter and gave him the promised reward without a second thought.
    576321|00000000||A Novigrad merchant by the name of Sylvester Armello had hung a notice on the Novigrad board asking for help in tracking down a thieving imp. It seemed the merchants' guild was being pestered by a mysterious creature who kept stealing wares from its members stalls. Geralt accepted the job.<br>

    531193|00000000||A certain nobleman asked Geralt for a bit of assistance. He wanted the witcher to accompany him on a stroll through a rather dodgy part of Novigrad. The richman's clothing alone would get him killed in that quarter, so Geralt agreed to help.<br>

Whether out of curiosity or because of the throbbing of his medallion, Geralt decided to investigate. It will surely come as no surprise that this investigation uncovered evidence of a monster's presence...<br>
   1051972|00000000||While in Novigrad, Geralt came across a notice offering a bounty for killing a certain White Lady haunting the fields outside the city. The witcher, who was always in need of coin for... what does he spend his coin on? Armor? Swords? Clips to hold back his hair? At any rate, he was forever short of it, and so accepted the contract.<br>
   1051973|00000000||The White Lady turned out to be a noonwraith. In order to defeat this phantom, Geralt first had to find out what bound it to the abandoned tower and its surrounding fields.<br>

   1059679|00000000||The Free City of Novigrad had known no king's rule for nearly two hundred years. Francis Bedlam surely had this fact in mind when he anointed himself the King of Beggars, a title that mocked the pomposity of crowned heads while simultaneously stealing a bit of said pomp for itself. Bedlam was a pragmatic man, a trait of great use in his profession, which involved managing a network of thieves, beggars, tramps and street urchins that trickled through every part of the city.<br><br>His contacts provided him with the freshest gossip and tastiest morsels of information, and the cut he took of his "subjects'" earnings guaranteed a sizeable income for the maintenance of his "court" in the Putrid Grove.<br>

   1050961|00000000||During one of his endless peregrinations Geralt ran into Blueboy Lugos, son of Madman Lugos. Thirsty for adventure and glory, the lad had set off to trek through the mysterious Cave of Dreams. The witcher knew the young warrior was no stranger to courage, but to knowledge, experience, and navigational ability he was a distant relation at best. Fearing the expedition would end in disaster, or at least leave the world one Lugos poorer, he offered his assistance.<br>
   1050962|00000000||According to legend, those foolhardy enough to enter the Cave of Dreams must confront what they fear most. Sometimes the past returns to haunt them - others, the future, prematurely exposed, strikes terror in their hearts. Geralt, Lugos and their companions knew they must fortify their courage to face such a challenge, and so prior to penetrating the cave's bowels put themselves into a trance using a mixture of hallucinogenic herbs. This concoction proved all too potent - even Geralt, who had imbibed more psychoactive substances than most men have milk, soon lost all contact of reality...<br>
   1050964|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partaken of the brain-addling herbs. He expected young Lugos, fresh from the same experience, to bid him a fond farewell. Yet the young warrior had in the meantime discovered Geralt was obliged to help him as repayment for a debt, and yet still had demanded payment for his services. Lugos gave him the promised gold, but it was clear that Geralt, though substantially richer, had lost the respect of Clan Drummond's heir.<br>
   1050965|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partook of the brain-addling herbs. Young Lugos thanked Geralt for his help and cleared him of all debts to Clan Drummond. Geralt returned to his path, swearing that, in the future he would think twice before stepping into Skellige taverns...<br>
   1050993|00000000||Lugos, Jarl of Clan Drummond, might indeed have been as mad as they said, but when the need arose he could calculate as coolly as the sanest of men. When Geralt was brought before him to be tried, he resisted any howls for blood braying in his unhinged mind and instead let the witcher go, thus banking himself a debt of gratitude with a man well able to repay it. He then transferred that credit to his son, sending Geralt off to help Blueboy Lugos traverse the nightmarish Cave of Dreams.
   1051008|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partook of the brain-addling herbs. Though not sure himself if the creatures they had battled were truly nightmarish or merely nightmares, Lugos generously rewarded Geralt for his help in defeating them.<br>
   1087235|00000000||While Geralt was curious what secrets lay in the mysterious Cave of Dreams, his interest must have sputtered out before anything became of it. First chance he got, he slipped away from the expedition and returned to his own Path.

It's to hunt. To kill. </i><br>– Jahne Oldak, royal huntsman<br><br>Bears are omnivores – meaning men find a place in their diet beside berries, roots and salmon. When they snack on humans, they most frequently partake of the meat of travelers unwittingly trespassing on their territory, or else that of hunters for whom besting such a creature is a lifelong ambition.<br><br>There are several subspecies of bears – black bears, polar bears and cave bears – which differ from one another in coloring as well as in size and strength. All share one trait in common, however: a near-unmatched ability to kill.<br>
   1077637|00000000||Bears are found far from human habitation, in high mountains or deep woods. They are solitary creatures - and a good thing they are, for defeating a single bear is challenge to anyone, experienced witchers included. Fighting a bear should be avoided, but if it cannot, one should not try to run away – these seemingly clumsy animals can run at an astonishingly high speed, especially if angered.

   1046083|00000000||It turned out Sigi Reuven was none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence and a man well-known to Geralt from past adventures. In an atypical bout of ignorance, Dijkstra had no inkling I was involved in the theft of his gold. He treated Geralt's appearance as a fortunate coincidence and offered him a handsome sum in return for help finding his stolen wealth - and the thief who had stolen it. Geralt and Dijkstra thus both wanted to find the exact some person - yours truly - albeit for entirely different reasons. Seizing this bit of good fortune, Geralt accepted the offer and hoped against hope Dijkstra wouldn't catch on to his double dealing.<br>
   1046084|00000000||Like an excavator uncovering an ancient elven masterpiece, Geralt slowly revealed the hidden brilliance of my plan. He discovered we had not barged in directly from the sewers like brain-dead lugs, but had instead struck from the inside, by placing a bomb in one of the tubs' drainpipes.<br><br>Hearing this, Dijkstra summoned his faithful eunuch, Happen, and had him examine the bathhouse guest registry. From it they learned the tub in question had been used that day by a certain Margrave Henckel. Nothing unusual about a margrave giving his corns a bit of a soak - but this particular margrave had shuffled off his mortal coil, corns and all, a few months prior to the break-in. Dijkstra thus tasked Geralt with examining the margrave's residence, in the hope that the witcher would find some trace of the stolen treasure there.<br>
   1046085|00000000||The old spy's intuition did not lead him astray - Margrave Henckel's home truly did prove a source of many interesting and vital clues. Firstly, they discovered that Geralt's doppler acquaintance of yore, Dudu, had been one of the heist's participants. It was he who had disguised himself as Margrave Henckel and placed the bomb in the drainpipe.<br><br>A letter left by Dudu contained further revelations - Ciri had taken part in the heist as well, the stolen gold had ended up in the hands of the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, and I, Dandelion, was now this heinous man's prisoner.<br><br>Geralt clearly needed to confront Menge. The question was how. The cautious guardsman would never agree to a meeting - unless, that is, Geralt had something to offer him, a prize so tempting he'd throw caution to the wind…<br>Triss Merigold, vile sorceress and member of the even viler Lodge of Sorceresses, was willing to offer herself up as irresistible bait for this fanatic hunter of witches, putting her life in danger in order to save Ciri and, I dare say, with a thought in her heart for the art-loving denizens of the North, who otherwise risked being deprived of their most prominent bard.
   1046086|00000000||Caleb Menge took the bait hook, line and sinker, oblivious to Geralt's trickery to the very end. Said end was brought to him by Triss, who stuck a knife in his throat in an emotional outburst understandable from someone who had just been subjected to cruel and unusual torture.<br><br> Luckily, Geralt had by this time already squeezed the information he needed out of Menge. He had learned that I, Dandelion, was rotting in the Temple Isle dungeons, waiting to be transported to Oxenfurt, where I would play my last leading role in a spectacle sure to leave the audience in tears - my own execution. Yet Triss, gods bless her heart, had a plan for preventing this...<br>
   1046087|00000000||The witcher has many virtues, but sadly patience and subtlety are not among them. And so, instead of sticking to the plan, Geralt decided to do things his own way - by slicing down every witch hunter in sword's reach and butchering Caleb Menge before getting any useful information out of him.<br><br>Luckily, however, Geralt did not leave the compound empty-handed. He found instructions among Menge's documents for contacting a mysterious individual who seemed to be directing the Temple Guard's actions. There was a chance this eminence grise, whoever he or she was, knew something about my fate.<br>
   1046088|00000000||Dijkstra was less than satisfied with Geralt's performance as a treasure hunter. Firstly, the witcher had not actually recovered any treasure - just a key found on Menge's body that might open a vault that might contain the treasure, assuming said vault could even be located. Secondly, Dijkstra realized Geralt had been hiding something from him the entire time - the identity of the criminal mastermind responsible for planning the heist (but was this truly so difficult to guess, dear reader? After all, who else but a bard could have planned with such cunning and panache?). The old acquaintances ultimately parted on good terms - but it was clear to both their next meeting might not be so amiable.<br>
   1046089|00000000||Triss Merigold is usually an excruciatingly warm and tender-hearted individual. Yet on this day the witcher discovered the red-haired sorceress has a darker side as well. When Menge's contact refused to cooperate, Triss used her powers to force him to talk by making him feel unbearable pain - and then to ensure he would never speak of what he'd undergone.<br><br>This blood-curdling interrogation informed the witcher that I was imprisoned on Temple Isle, awaiting transport to my execution in Oxenfurt. A dark situation indeed - but Triss had an idea how to keep it from getting any darker...<br>
   1086186|00000000||Fear gripped the witcher's heart as he knocked on the bathhouse doors. He knew that, shortly before I disappeared without a trace, I had been planning to rob Sigi Reuven, one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the North. He would have to inquire about my fate without arousing any suspicions, which was a tall order indeed - for while Geralt may be an excellent witcher, he is one lousy actor.<br>

    521461|00000000||Able to persuade Graham to go to the tower with you? Did you mention there was a pesta involved?
    521463|00000000||He knew the risks, but he'd also heard lots of stories about true love, whose kiss can break any spell. Can't help thinking that gave him courage.
    521465|00000000||And? It ended well?
    521467|00000000||Depends how you look at it. Curse is lifted, Anabelle's spirit has left in peace… but Graham's dead.
    521469|00000000||Oh, poor boy. Still, he's proved that true love may be more common than some suppose.
    521477|00000000||Graham just needed to bury her bones. So I'm assuming it did.
    588258|00000000||The lamp - what do you wanna do with it?
    521473|00000000||As I said, you may keep it. I don't believe I shall need it anymore given the isle's been cleansed.
    521475|00000000||I actually regret not going there with you. Perhaps we can make up for that lost time now.
    588251|00000000||What do you wanna do with the lamp?
    588345|00000000||I don't have time for this.
    588366|00000000||Got it all wrong, Keira. I'm not your errand boy.
    588361|00000000||Oh, you're definitely no boy. You're a strong, poised witcher who will surely help a woman in need.
    588363|00000000||Can't promise you anything, but I'll let you know if I run into him.
    588365|00000000||That is all I ask.
    588347|00000000||Why not. If he was coming here from Novigrad, he must've passed through Blackbough.
    588352|00000000||I'll check the area.
    588354|00000000||Thank you. I shall be ever so grateful.
    588344|00000000||Fine, I'll look into it.
    588322|00000000||All right. Time I was on my way.
    588324|00000000||Perhaps… perhaps you'd stay just a bit longer? There's one small favor you might yet do for me.
    588326|00000000||What is it?
    588341|00000000||I put in an order for a few substances from Novigrad. The trader was due to be here yesterday, but has yet to arrive.
    588343|00000000||Could you see what happened? The package is rather important to me.
    588259|00000000||Farewell.
    588252|00000000||Alexander was doing some strange research.
    588279|00000000||One thing's bothering me…
    588281|00000000||What?
    588283|00000000||Anabelle said Alexander was studying diseases. She mentioned "Catriona."
    588284|00000000||You knew this?
    588285|00000000||All the mages knew about it. Alexander was a highly regarded epidemiologist.
    588302|00000000||I would have given anything for an opportunity to study his notes, but he guarded them jealously.
    521479|00000000||Hm, I lifted the curse, so the island's clear. Anabelle's soul is free. Thing is, turned out she's a pesta. Graham's dead.
    521481|00000000||And you failed to notice? You're losing your touch. Be that as it may, Fyke Isle is free of its curse. That's important. I'm almost inclined to say, "good work."
    521483|00000000||And you withheld this news until now? Why? I gave you a xenovox! But the curse - what was its source?
    521485|00000000||The dark spell clung to the spirit of Anabelle, the lord's daughter. To free her and the isle, Graham, her beloved, had to help me.
    521487|00000000||So it ended well.
    513657|00000000||Fyke Isle - I managed to remove the curse.
    513656|00000000||Fyke Isle's free of its curse.

   1060525|00000000||The name of the King of the Wild Hunt, the identity of the lord of nightmares, the being behind the frightful mask - this long remained unknown. Over time, however, scraps of information gradually coalesced into a full likeness of our foe - but did nothing to detract from the terror he inspired.<br><br>The Wild Hunt was in truth an elite cavalry brigade from the world of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, and was commanded by their ambitious and ruthless king, Eredin Bréacc Glas. He would travel via secret paths through the cold emptiness between his world from ours to capture victims and take them back to his homeland as slaves.<br><br>The current object of his Hunt was Cirilla, whose power he wanted to harness for his own uses. The only obstacle in his path - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1060531|00000000||Ciri was able to shed a bit of light on the King of the Wild Hunt's motivations. The threat of annihilation hung over the Aen Elle homeland. Eredin, a warrior and a conqueror by nature, decided to solve this problem in the simplest possible way - by seizing our world. The key to doing so? Ciri's power, which would allow him to open the gates to a full-scale invasion.<br>
   1060530|00000000||Trusting in the strength of his magic and the skill of his Riders, Eredin boldly launched a frontal assault on Kaer Morhen. Despite the defenders' noble sacrifices, he came close to victory. Only Ciri's unleashed power forced Eredin to fall back. It was clear, however, that he would learn from this defeat and that his next attack would be insurmountable.<br>
   1060532|00000000||According to Avallac'h, it was Eredin who bore responsibility for the death of Auberon Muircetach, the previous ruler of the Aen Elle. Revealing this fact would certainly not earn him friends and popularity amongst the Alder Folk.<br>
   1060534|00000000||Eredin's last battle is worthy of a poem - nay, an epic - all to itself, yet this is neither the time nor the place to pen it. To be brief, on that fateful day the cruel King of the Hunt seemed unstoppable and tore asunder all who dared stand in his way - until, that is, his way led him smack into Geralt of Rivia. The two expert fighters faced off in a last skirmish on the ghastly deck of the Naglfar. The fight was long and difficult, but the witcher's blade struck true in the end, cutting down Eredin's dreams of power and conquest.<br><br>So died Eredin Bréacc Glas, King of the Wild Hunt.

    400392|00000000||Shortly after arriving in Skellige Geralt received a letter from his old friend, the jarl Crach an Craite, lord of Kaer Trolde castle. It turned out the witcher was not the only one searching for lost loved ones. Crach's son, Hjalmar, whose famed courage pushed him to feats only a madman would dare, had disappeared after sailing off to the island of Undvik to prove his strength against the Ice Giant. This beast had slept for centuries in the frozen bowels of the island, forgotten to men - until one day he awoke and began to murder and destroy. Hjalmar wanted to defeat the Giant and win back the island for the few left alive who had once called it home - at the same time winning everlasting fame for himself. Yet something must not have gone as the young an Craite had planned, for weeks had passed since his departure and he still had not returned. It became clear that someone would have to face the danger lurking on Undvik and survive, returning to tell Crach of the fate of his first-born son. And though the warriors of Skellige are famed for their courage and skill in battle, Crach knew there was only one man who stood a chance against such a monster - Geralt of Rivia.

    460201|00000000||On the coast of Ard Skellig Geralt ran into a young warrior - well, he stopped running before he hit the young man, but I believe you get my drift, dear reader - at any rate, the point of my story was not that he ran up to (not into!) this said warrior, but that the warrior was besieged by pirates at the time. Geralt helped him fight off his attackers and listened (with only a slight amount of witcher impatience) to his story, which was as follows: the man's sister had been kidnapped by pirates (not unlike the ones he had just faced), and he was determined to track her down, even if it meant searching all the isles in the Skellige archipelago. He thanked Geralt for his help in dealing with one of what would surely be many patches of pirate trouble and continued on his path.<br>
   1051168|00000000||While visiting Freya's temple on the isle of Hindarsfjall Geralt met a woman named Kurisu who told him how she had managed to escape the clutches of a band of ruthless pirates who had kidnapped her. Who would have imagined a frame so slender could hold such bravery? Perhaps one day I shall write a ballad about her - "Kurisu, Kurisu, full of courage and daring-do..."
    460202|00000000||Find the pirate ship.

   1053117|00000000||Those on the Continent worship the gods by praying, burning incense and making offerings. In Skellige, all these are practiced, but the islanders consider the best way of honoring the gods to be risking one's life while performing feats of bravery. A favorite way to do this? Taking part in the Heroes' Dash, a race full of strong emotions and frightening dangers sure to make the goddess smile.<br><br>Geralt is not the most pious of fellows, but the prize on offer for the race's winner (as well as the chance to test Roach's speed against the best Skellige mounts) convinced him to join in.<br>
   1053119|00000000||There he faced the winner of last year's Dash: Astrid the Vipress. Though she was as vast and dangerous as her name-snake, even she was unable to beat the witcher. Geralt's victory brought glory to him and joy to the goddess - with a handsome prize making it all the sweeter.

   1048579|00000000||What does one expect to find inside an abandoned country manor? Dusty crockery. Moth-eaten doilies. A moldy trophy buck, perhaps, if its inhabitants trod on the wild side. Certainly not the most wanted man north or south of the Yaruga. Yet that, dear reader, is exactly who Geralt found when he entered such a manor in Lindenvale. The assassin of kings himself, Geralt's old acquaintance, his sometime friend and sometime enemy: Letho. He was hiding there from bounty hunters out for his scalp. Geralt, now fully able to remember how Letho and two of his colleagues once saved Yennefer's life, could not refuse him help.<br>
   1048580|00000000||What Letho did next proved he was both clever and fearless. In order to get rid of the bounty hunters breathing down his neck once and for all, he took a crossbow bolt to the chest and faked his own death. This caught Geralt by surprise, but he improvised splendidly. Convinced Letho was dead, Vester and his men rode off to spread the news far and wide. Letho could now simply lie low for a spell and wait for the world to forget about him...<br>
   1048581|00000000||What Letho did next proved he was both clever and fearless. In order to get rid of the bounty hunters breathing down his neck once and for all, he took a crossbow bolt to the chest and faked his own death. This caught Geralt by surprise, and sadly the witcher doesn't always handle surprises with much tact or subtlety. Instead, he usually does what he did this time, namely murder all and sundry within sword's reach. There were thus no witnesses to spread the false news of Letho's death, and the wanted man was right back where he started.<br>
   1048641|00000000||Geralt proposed that his old acquaintance seek shelter at Kaer Morhen. Letho hesitated, but in the end accepted the offer.
   1048642|00000000||Somewhere along the way Geralt parted with Letho. To this day no one knows if he did this on purpose or merely got lost, but one thing is certain - the two witchers' paths never crossed again.<br>
   1092036|00000000||While traversing the inhospitable lands of Velen, Geralt came across an abandoned farming estate. Upon entering the estate's farmhouse, he discovered that, though seemingly uninhabited, it was crammed full of deadly traps. Someone clearly did not want any uninvited guests snooping around the place. Geralt decided to find out who - and why.

    466301|00000000||In No Man's Land Geralt was given a contract by an Eternal Fire priest. His task: to burn the bodies of soldiers who had fallen during the recent battle in order to keep necrophages from eating them.<br>
   1051213|00000000||The witcher followed the priest's directions and went to burn the bodies. Doing so revealed the clergyman's true motivations: lighting the fire he had requested would also burn evidence of the priest's involvement in the fisstech trade..<br>
   1051214|00000000||Though his contract giver had proven to be a hypocrite and a drug dealer, Geralt accepted his coin. As the ancient proverb says, <i>pecunia non olet</i>.

   1086290|00000000||During one of his numerous adventures, Geralt got his hands on a map covered with strange markings. He quickly deduced that they  indicated the locations of hidden witcher caches and, intrigued by the chance of discovering long-lost crafting schematics, he set out to find them.
   1086291|00000000||Geralt found all the caches marked on the map and recovered the crafting schematics contained therein. With these in hand, he could add life-saving improvements to his combat gear. He did not know how many more such caches remained undiscovered in the world - but hoped one day he would have the chance to find more.

   1082624|00000000||<i>It just me, or is that gargoyle ogling us?</i><br>– Lara Estevann, burglar from Loc Muinne<br><br>Gargoyles are stone statues brought to life by magic in order to guard mages' laboratories and lairs from intruders. Their appearance alone has scared off more than one prospective burglar. Those who do not take fright at the sight of these horned and winged monstrosities usually die shortly thereafter, torn to shreds by stony claws.<br>
   1082625|00000000||Gargoyles are extremely dangerous opponents. Carved from granite or marble, they are able to withstand tremendous amounts of damage and exhibit superhuman strength. One blow dealt from their boulder-like fists will crush even a man clad in heavy armor. Not even those out of reach of a gargoyle's arms can feel safe, for they are able to throw hunks of stone with deadly precision.<br><br>Due to gargoyles' considerable size and weight, the Aard Sign does nothing against them. As beings made of stone, they feel no pain from fire, meaning the Igni Sign is worthless against them, as are weapons meant to cause bleeding or poisoning. It is a witcher's good fortune that they also have a few weaknesses: they feel the sting of a silver blade and are hurt by dimeritium bombs, which disrupt the workings of the magic spell which gives them life.

   1078416|00000000||A true master armorer is a rare bird indeed, so we can honestly speak of delight sparking in Geralt's heart when he first met Yoana. Yet before she could forge him new armor, she was in need of some assistance. The witcher would have to hunt down an archgriffin and extract from it some ingredients required for the forging of the finest armors.<br>
   1078417|00000000||An archgriffin is not a foe to be taken lightly, a fact Geralt knew full well. Yet in the end he was able to defeat the beast and took from it not just the ingredients for the armorer, but also a trophy he could turn in to the quartermaster of Crow's Perch for a reward.

    395875|00000000||What?
    395879|00000000||Ooo, think you bloody scare me?
   1002192|00000000||As you recall, the self-proclaimed baron of Velen had asked Geralt to find his missing family. And so, ever a man of his word, find them he did. Tamara, the baron's daughter, he found in Oxenfurt, where she had joined the witch hunters. As for Anna, the baron's wife, she had been kidnapped by the Crones and made their slave, in fulfillment of a bargain she had struck with them earlier. Hearing this, the baron swore to free Anna, with or without the witcher's help, and set off to the place in the bog where Geralt had seen his wife.<br>
   1002193|00000000||Geralt decided to help the baron and went with him into the bog. There they ran into unexpected company: Tamara, accompanied by a band of witch hunters, had also ventured out in search of Anna.<br>They joined forces and, in the end, Anna was found, but, sadly, her mind was lost for good. Driven near mad himself with grief, the baron swore he would take his addled wife away from Velen and search the whole world for someone able to help her. As for Tamara, she and the witch hunters returned to Novigrad. And then... well, dear reader, the ultimate fate of the baron and his family is a tale for another time.
   1002194|00000000||Geralt decided to help the baron and ventured with him into the bog. There they happened upon unexpected company - Tamara and a band of witch hunters, who had also set out in search of Anna.<br>They joined forces and found Anna, sadly turned into a terrible beast by a curse the Crones had cast. Geralt decided he would try to lift the curse and went to Johnny, the godling, for help.<br>
   1002195|00000000||And Johnny, as always, proved very helpful indeed. He revealed to Geralt that the Crones worked their magic in the basement of the hut with the tapestry. When Geralt and Graden descended into the basement, they found a collection of dolls with various items attached to them. They tried to reverse the curse by removing the doll that represented Anna, but their efforts ended in catastrophe - Anna burst into flames and died. Tamara returned to Oxenfurt following her mother's death, her spirits crushed. The baron, in no less foul a mood, went back to Crow's Perch. Geralt watched him walk away, wondering if he would ever see the man again.<br>
   1002196|00000000||And Johnny, as always, proved very helpful indeed. He revealed to Geralt that the Crones worked their magic in the cellar of the hut with the tapestry. When Geralt and Graden descended down into it, they found a collection of dolls with various items attached to them. They tried to lift the curse by removing the doll that represented Anna, but their efforts ended in catastrophe - Anna's curse was lifted, but she died soon afterwards, for the Crones had constructed it to leave death as its parting gift. Following her mother's death, Tamara returned to Oxenfurt, her spirits crushed. The baron, in no less foul a mood, went back to Crow's Perch. Geralt watched him walk away, wondering if he would ever see the man again.<br>
   1002197|00000000||In the end, Geralt decided he would look in on the baron. When he reached Crow's Perch, he inquired after the man but was saddened to learn he was dead. The lord of Velen had hanged himself, ending his reign and his sorrow.
   1087105|00000000||In the end, the baron had only his own men to help him in his task. Geralt must have decided he had already done plenty by finding Anna and didn't want any more to do with the Crones than was absolutely necessary.<br><br>The witcher never saw the baron again. Perhaps the upstart lord of Velen died in the swamps while trying to find his wife - or perhaps he wanders there still to this day...

    590115|00000000||Gotta say I'm curious what happened to her... And I didn't want any Redanians getting in my way while I tried to find out.
    589855|00000000||Look. Found this in Philippa's hideout.
    589857|00000000||A megascope crystal? Damn, it's cracked… but it could still work.

    590124|00000000||Largely depends on what's in this.

    563375|00000000||What a king. Not only cruel, but naive as well. Did he truly believe you would help him?
    589853|00000000||I took the job.
    590118|00000000||Why?
    509930|00000000||Maybe it's true what they say? The witches prepare a deluge?
    509804|00000000||Once she'd been shaved, they began to dunk her. They say that's when she summoned demons!
    509806|00000000||And the one hunter she touched got the mange and died three days after!
    509850|00000000||What else, with her husband dead? She works the streets!

   1049776|00000000||While muddling around the well-shaded village of Blackbough, Geralt happened across a notice. It stated a hunter named Niellen was looking for any help he could get in finding his wife, who had disappeared in the nearby woods a few days earlier. Geralt, already deep in a search-and-rescue vein, decided to help find the woman.<br>
   1049788|00000000||While Geralt was combing the woods for signs of the missing woman, he came across Margaret, Hanna's sister. The woman asked the witcher to abandon his search and tell Niellen his wife was dead. Margaret thought the sooner Niellen came to terms with his loss, the sooner he would be able to put it behind him and start living his life. Geralt decided this made sense and agreed.<br>
   1049777|00000000||The story of Hanna's disappearance had a tragic end. It turned out she had been killed by her own husband. He did not do this on purpose, however. Afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, he would hide in the forest during his transformations in order to protect his friends and loved ones.<br><br>Hanna's sister Margaret knew this secret, and had one of her own - she was in love with Niellen and fiercely jealous of Hanna's life with him. She decided to take Hanna into the woods to watch her husband's transformation, hoping she'd then abandon him in disgust. Sadly, Hanna was careless enough to draw the werewolf's attention. Margaret was able to escape, but her sister was not so lucky. Niellen, transformed into a bloodthirsty beast, slaughtered the love of his life with his own hands.<br>

    522073|00000000||In his previous adventures, Geralt had gained fame as a master dice poker player. Yet having mastered all challengers in this arena, he had no choice but to find another in which to garner more laurels. He thus decided to take up gwent, and since he aimed to play at the highest levels, he felt he had to gather a complete collection of all the cards available - including some which could only be had by winning them off the best players around.<br>
   1077915|00000000||Geralt wore out the soles of more than one pair of boots and more than once cursed Lady Luck profusely, but in the end he was able to gather all the cards gwent had to offer, including the rarest of the rare.

    550419|00000000||A mysterious fog that killed all who ventured into it had arisen near the village of Downwarren - inconveniently close to where peat was being dug. Geralt decided to investigate this murderous mist and see if he couldn't put a stop to it.<br>
   1051935|00000000||Near the village called Downwarren, Geralt came across a man who dug peat for a living. One glance was enough to know something was ailing the poor fellow. He warned the witcher about a strangling fog which had sprung up in the nearby swamp. The man's story convinced Geralt a monster was at work and so he decided to look into the matter.<br>
   1051936|00000000||Geralt's investigation took him to the very heart of the swamp. As he was walking an exceptionally hideous foglet suddenly jumped out at him from an unusually thick patch of fog. The monster was old and strong, making defeating of it no easy labor. Geralt managed the task, however, and a few moments after the foglet breathed its last, the poisonous fog dispersed and the witcher could at last fill his lungs safely.<br>
   1051937|00000000||While traversing an unpleasant swamp near the village of Downwarren, Geralt came across some very unusual tracks. His instincts told him they might have been left by a monster, so he decided to take a closer look...<br>
   1051938|00000000||Hoping to find someone who would offer him a reward, Geralt went to Downwarren. A peat digger residing in that village was grateful Geralt had enabled a return to his labors and so handed the witcher some coin.
   1051939|00000000||Hoping to find someone who would offer him a reward, Geralt went to Downwarren. A peat digger residing there was grateful to the witcher for enabling him to return to his labors and promised the witcher a generous reward - if he could stand to wait a few days while he gathered more funds. Geralt agreed, and in return for his patience received a purse full of gold crowns.

   1002633|00000000||Geralt knew he could only defeat Eredin with the help of mages and on his own terms. Since the King of the Wild Hunt was traveling on the Naglfar, the spectral vessel known from Skellige legend, somewhere between worlds, our heroes had to summon him back and somehow cut off his escape route. Such a feat could only be performed by a group of mages acting in concert and aided by a legendary elven artifact - the Sunstone.<br>
   1002634|00000000||The emperor's flagship was anchored in Skellige's waters when Geralt arrived. His Imperial Majesty would preside over the battle in person - but more important to Geralt was the prisoner he held on his ship, the Nilfgaardian sorceress Fringilla Vigo, whose aid could turn the tide of Ciri's defense. Geralt thus asked the Emhyr to lend him his captive sorceress. Though Fringilla was a suspected traitor, Emhyr agreed.<br>
   1002635|00000000||Geralt overcame countless obstacles and found the Sunstone - a feat which, to give credit where it's due, would have been impossible without the help of Philippa Eilhart. Everyone knew what this meant: the preparations for the great battle against the Wild Hunt had come to an end, and what would follow their activation of the Sunstone would determine the fate of the world.

Within the colony their duty lies in building nests and cocoons, acquiring food and caring for eggs and larvae. When threatened they will summon warriors to aid them, yet if forced to defend themselves they will – and do so surprisingly well.<br>
   1077739|00000000||Endrega workers are most often found traveling in groups of half-dozen or more members. They move slowly, yet when attacking, they are capable of covering the distance to their victim in the blink of an eye. Like all of their kind, endrega workers are highly venomous. Their bite is toxic, as are any wounds dealt by the bony growths on the ends of their limbs. They can also spew acid to great effect from a distance of several paces. Their usual tactic is to surround their enemy and attack him from several sides at once. Like all insectoids they do not suffer particularly from bleeding, yet are caused great harm by insectoid oil.

   1051285|00000000||Geralt followed the thread back to its source and wound up at a place where Nilfgaardian spies loaded and unloaded contraband. Geralt might not take a keen interest in politics, but he noted the emperor certainly seemed to be taking a keen interest in Novigrad.

A well-treated pet repays his owner with loyalty and trust, whereas an ill-treated one repays this treatment in kind as well, meeting yells with barks and kicks with bites. Since there is an abundance of bad men, so, too, is there an abundance of bad dogs. Most dangerous of all are the vagrant mutts who have lost all respect for men and developed a taste for blood and carrion.<br>
   1077602|00000000||Dogs usually attack in packs, choosing isolated victims, especially ones in whom they sense some kind of weakness. Packs of rabid dogs usually only dare attack children, drunkards, the elderly and cripples. Yet when backed into a corner, they will defend themselves with frothing bites and sharp claws against all and sundry.

   1059648|00000000||A joke circulates about the back alleys and seedy taverns of Novigrad. It claims the dwarf Carlo Varese, one of the four leading lights of the local criminal strata, was, in his own way, a fierce proponent of racial coexistence. He applied this principle in a somewhat selective fashion, however.<br><br>Cleaver firmly felt that, as an assimilated dwarven resident of the city of Novigrad, he had every right to run his own business. Anyone who had a problem with the way he ran it or with the nature of his dealings - be they dwarf, human or halfling - revealed themselves a vile racist. And what was the only fitting thing to do with such scum? Why, feed them to a herd of ferociously hungry hogs – right after he sliced off their fingers with his namesake cleaver. Naturally, such tales could very well have been mere rumor and slander – but very few had the courage to test their veracity.<br>
   1059649|00000000||Cleaver was famed for his hot temper. What boiled his blood hottest of all, however, were folk who thought they could pull one over on him.<br><br>No wonder, then, that the attack by Whoreson's thugs riled him somewhat. The violent tirade he directed at Wiley clearly contained not idle threats but promises he meant to keep, even if doing so meant leaving half a district of the city in ruins.<br>

   1077772|00000000||Basilisks love dark, damp places such as cellars, caves and city sewers.

For this reason many men, their courage girded by goldlust, take to hunting them. Most of these hunts end in disaster, but some do manage to bag their prey, which has led to a drastic decline in this creature's numbers in recent years. Some mages and druids are of the opinion that basilisks should be included in programs meant to safeguard dying species. Everyone else thinks those mages and druids have gone completely mad.

   1061133|00000000||After Guthlaf, trusted seneschal to the an Craite jarls, passed away a portion of his duties were taken over by the jarl's cupbearer, Arnvald.

   1083602|00000000||Geralt needed to face Eredin, but could only hope to beat him with the help of friends. The Wild Hunt would only be defeated with magic of the extraordinarily powerful kind. So Triss and Yen set out to reassemble the Lodge of Sorceresses. Avallac'h, too, began to lay plans of his own.
   1083603|00000000||The elven Sage decided to erode the King of the Hunt's support in his own realm. With Geralt in tow, he ventured through several worlds to the city of Tir nà Lia, where they found Eredin's viceroy, Ge'els.<br><br>Ge’els had been a loyal subject of the Alder Folk's previous king. When he learned Eredin was a regicide, he agreed to help Avallac'h and Geralt defeat the usurper.

    345548|ad0723d2||Eustace
   1051210|00000000||News that Ciri and Geralt had defeated and killed Imlerith reached Avallac'h at once. I don't know how this happened, exactly, save perhaps that quickly learning of such things is the very essence of being a "Sage."<br><br>At any rate, a wild notion possessed him. What if they could now sway Ge'els, one of Eredin's most powerful allies? What if they could bring him over to their side? A key general and advisor, Ge'els was the individual Eredin relied on for reinforcements. For his plan to work, he would need a dreamer, so Triss pointed him towards Corinne Tilly in Novigrad. Thus, by the time Geralt and Ciri rode into town, everything had been arranged. Now all they needed was Ge'els...<br><br>To reach him, Avallac'h and Geralt would need to travel to the land of the Aen Elle, a voyage that would involve interdimensional travel, which in turn meant a whole lot of teleporting. Geralt vomited a little in his mouth and prepared to face the music.<br>
   1051894|00000000||Ah, what I wouldn't give to see with my own eyes what Geralt saw in the worlds he traversed. Yet most intriguing of all seemed the world of the Aen Elle, the end point of Geralt's and Avallac'h's journey. To behold the glories of this ancient elven civilization… but alas, fate granted this privilege not to a poet but to a witcher, who returned not with paeans to the distant world's beauty, but with a general of the Wild Hunt - one Ge'els. I must be fair, however, and state that the general proved useful.<br><br>Avallac'h decided to bet all on the ace he had tucked up his sleeve. With the help of the dreamer Corinne Tilly, he proved to Ge'els that Eredin had killed Auberon, the erstwhile king of the Aen Elle and the object of Ge'els' undying devotion.<br><br>Confronted by this revelation, Ge'els could hardly return to business as usual. He struggled internally for some moments before revealing the one way Geralt and friends could hope to defeat Eredin and company. They would have to battle Eredin and the Hunt in their own world and on their own terms. The first step - to use the Sunstone to summon the Naglfar. A plan of action was devised - Geralt, Ciri, the sorceresses and Avallac'h would sail to Skellige to find the stone, while Zoltan and I would stay behind in Novigrad to keep the hearth fires burning and secure our friends' return.
   1051893|00000000||An unpleasant surprise was in store for Geralt after he departed the Ddiddiwedht Desert: Avallac'h was no longer with him. The Sage had warned him that something of the sort might happen, but Geralt had quietly hoped this would not be the case.

   1077280|00000000||A botchling will emerge from its lair at night to lurk by the bedside of an expectant mother, draining her strength and that of her unborn progeny as she sleeps. A woman thus beleaguered first suffers from troubling dreams, then fever, delirium and a general weakening of the flesh. After a few such nights she is enfeebled and unable to defend herself - it is then the botchling attacks directly, sinking its long, sharp fangs into her body and drinking of her blood until mother and fetus perish together.<br><br>A botchling stands around a foot and a half in height, but, when threatened and if gorged with blood, it can change form. At such times it grows into a deformed man, hunched over and striding, ape-like, on its forearms. Stronger and fiercer after this alteration, it hurls itself into direct, physical combat, gnashing at its opponent or attacking him with sharp claws.<br><br>A botchling's curse can be lifted by transforming it into a lubberkin - a guardian spirit of the hearth that watches over the family it never knew in the house it never could call home.

   1054949|00000000||Skellige warriors are the hearty, adventure-loving sort, so surely they handle their own monster problems? No, not as it turns out. Geralt found a notice in a village called Larvik requesting assistance with clearing the area of some troublesome beasts.<br>
   1054951|00000000||In the end the alpha nekker fell to the witcher's blade. Geralt took its head as a trophy and went to Larvik to collect his reward.
   1074091|00000000||On the isle of Hindarsfjall, not far from the village known as Larvik, Geralt spied some monster tracks. Where there's a monster, there's work for a witcher. And where there's work for a witcher, there's coin to be made. Geralt decided to look into the matter.<br>
   1074092|00000000||Geralt discovered that the nekkers dwelling in the nearby wood were led by a particularly strong nekker warrior. Its presence had made the others more aggressive and daring. The only way to solve this problem was to enter the nekkers' lair and kill their leader.<br>

    588851|00000000||Welcome.
   1061120|00000000||Though Madman Lugos, jarl of Clan Drummond, was nothing special in terms of size or strength, most men in the isles still stepped aside when they saw him coming. Eternally feuding with his neighbors, Lugos had a reputation for a furious and violent temper and managed to get into shouting matches with even the usually-placid Donar an Hindar.<br><br>Yet Lugos' biggest rival was Crach an Craite, whom he accused of stealing part of his domain (which in his reckoning encompassed all of Ard Skellig). The clans' quarrel went back hundreds of years and there was nothing to indicate it would end while these two fierce enemies lived. Lugos hated Crach with a passion dampened only by the laws of Skellige and the disproportionate balance of power between the two clans.<br>
   1061121|00000000||Seeing his own son die and Crach an Craite's child take the throne of Skellige proved too much for Lugos to bear. Enraged and embittered, he refused to listen to reason and attacked the witcher, thus picking a fight that could only end one way.

   1086959|00000000||<br>This ancient foglet proved particularly adept in the art of forming illusions. Only a professional monster slayer skilled with Signs and swords could best such a foe. Luckily, Geralt fit that description perfectly.
   1087395|00000000||<i>Careful, sir, a monster prowls the bog. Enter the mist and ye'll never see home again!</i><br>– Leslav, peat digger<br>
   1081436|00000000||The monster haunting the peat bogs of Velen turned out to be an ancient foglet. These are exceptionally long-lived creatures - some have even dwelt on this earth for over two hundred years, growing stronger and stronger all the while. Blows dealt by foglets of such an age carry so much power blocking them is out of the question. These foglets possess the ability to move extremely quickly, and not even Yrden can slow them down. Furthermore, they can meld completely into the mist, then suddenly rematerialize to strike from behind. Wearing heavy armor or making good use of the Quen Sign is highly recommended.

She woke Geralt one night and urged him to come with her to Velen. She new she would find Imlerith there, atop Bald Mountain. She had decided he had to die.
   1083601|00000000||The plan proved a sound one. On Bald Mountain Geralt and Ciri killed Imlerith and two of the Crones. Spurred by the success, they decided to challenge Eredin himself.

   1083242|00000000||Yennefer's suspicions proved true - Ciri had indeed appeared in Skellige. She had arrived from another world, together with a masked mage. She and the mage had then fought the Wild Hunt, before fleeing through portals that carried them to Velen.<br><br>There, one trail ended and another began. A long time later the Wild Hunt had reappeared on the isle of Hindarsfjall. This could mean Ciri had returned to Skellige once more.

   1077318|00000000||Some time after he reunited with Yennefer in White Orchard Geralt returned to that village. During his previous visit, he had hunted a griffin. This time, his task was to catch a runaway horse.<br>
   1077319|00000000||The horse belonged to a soldier returning from war. It turned out it had run off to seek its beloved master. Geralt got into a chat with the soldier and listened to a few of his bitter words about the last phases of the war.

    565960|00000000||I doubt he'll think the elves of the White Fleet suddenly longed to see him.
    565962|00000000||We can alter the signal emitted by the Sunstone. Unlikely Eredin will recognize it's origin.
    565964|00000000||It's not the only artifact to possess this power.
    565966|00000000||There're others? Great. Now mind telling me why I had to scour Skellige looking for this one?

   1053608|00000000||While wallowing in the Bits, Novigrad's worst and most notorious slum, the witcher took a contract on a monster committing horrendous murders under the cover of darkness. At the time, he never suspected that a story starting in the gutter would end in a luxurious manor.<br>
   1053619|00000000||It turned out the monster was an ekimmara, but that was of minor importance. What was truly interesting was that Lambert was hunting the creature as well. And most interesting of all was that he was doing so in order to get to the leader of a group of assassins who had killed his friend. One by one our heroes hunted down the members of the group until they finally found their boss - Jad Karadin.<br>
   1053625|00000000||In the end, Lambert and Geralt found this Jad Karadin. The man was living in the lap of luxury and would have blended in perfectly amongst the cream of Novigrad's crop - had he not been a witcher from the Cat School. Quite unexpectedly, Karadin welcomed them into his home and introduced them to his wife, Leticia, and his two adopted children.<br><br>Over the course of their conversation, Karadin tried to do the impossible: convince two trained killers bent on his death to let him live. He said he was a changed man and had sworn off his assassin ways. Yet his repentance had come too late, and he paid for his past crimes with his own blood.<br>
   1053626|00000000||In the end, Lambert and Geralt found this Jad Karadin. When they did, they were in for some serious surprises. The man was in fact a retired witcher, now living in the lap of luxury, surrounded by his beautiful... family? But how? While there was nothing surprising about his wife, Leticia, the last thing Geralt expected to find in the home of a sterile witcher were two bright-eyed children. It turned out the kids were adopted, and Karadin swore he loved them as if they were his own. Karadin convinced the witchers he had changed for the better and set aside his killing ways. Hearing this, Geralt told Lambert to abandon his plans for vengeance. Did he do right? That, dear reader, is not something a chronicler scribbling the tale down in a comfortable alcove with the benefit of hindsight is in a position to judge.
   1071181|00000000||Near the Novigrad docks Geralt ran into his old brother at arms, Lambert. Geralt's surprise grew when he realized the ekimmara they both were hunting was not the chief reason for Lambert's presence in the city. But before they could sit down for a heartfelt chat, the two witchers had to deal with their dishonest contractor. How many times will men try to cheat witchers out of honest pay for honest work before they learn...? <br> That taken care of, Geralt could now talk to Lambert. It turned out he was hunting the people responsible for the death of his friend, Aiden, a witcher from the Cat School. Lambert had learned Aiden had been murdered by a gang of hired thugs led by a man named Jad Karadin. Geralt decided to help Lambert and the two set off on a path to revenge.<br>
   1087106|00000000||Though the contract had seemed fascinating at first, Geralt quickly lost interest. He never found out what sort of mysterious monster had been prowling the streets of Novigrad at night.
   1087107|00000000||Though resolving this matter was of the utmost importance to Lambert, Geralt soon lost interest in it completely. He never found Jad Karadin.

   1051925|00000000||In the village of Lindenvale Geralt came across a highly unusual contract. A certain hunter was worried by some strange tracks he had found in the woods and sought someone who could help him determine to whom - or to what - they belonged.<br>
   1051926|00000000||In the village of Lindenvale Geralt came across tracks which indicated a beast of considerable size prowled the area. As a declared defender of mankind against monsters, he decided to investigate the matter.<br>
   1051929|00000000||The tracks took the witcher straight to a fiend's lair. Geralt quickly determined, however, that this monster was not the true threat to the local populace - not compared to what had killed it. That's right, something had beaten him to his initial task and slain the fiend, and he suspected this something was a chort attacking in an act of territorial warfare. Geralt had no other choice but to lure this powerful monster to him and attempt to slay it.<br>
   1051930|00000000||Geralt fought long and hard against the chort and in the end emerged victorious. After taking a trophy as proof of his deed, he went to Lindenvale and collected the reward promised by the hunter.

   1078237|00000000||Perhaps Freya judged the offering inadequate, or perhaps she had always scorned the merchant - one way or the other, the poor fellow did not manage to make it home alive. Geralt took custody of his abandoned possessions, though I doubt the thought entered his head to thank the goddess for this.

Though well-rotten carrion is their food of choice, they will not turn up their noses at fresh meat, man flesh included.<br>
   1077905|00000000||When they spy a potential victim, erynias, like harpies or shishigas, will try to make full use of the strength of their numbers and their ability to control the skies. They will circle above their prey then attack from several directions at once, striking with razor-shark talons and tearing their targets to shreds.<br><br>While attacking they aim for the neck, eyes and other vital organs, often causing their prey to bleed to death as a result. In this way a small flock of erynias is able to make quick work of larger and better-armed victims, who often are not able to defend themselves effectively from several opponents attacking at once.

There is one silver lining to this sad fact, however: the beasts living there must compete fiercely for hunting territory, meaning monsters often end up killing other monsters.

   1046080|00000000||Surprisingly, Geralt got some help from a villager he met near the castle. The old man directed the witcher to the source of an old well, claiming Geralt would find a way into Crow's Perch from there.<br>
   1046081|00000000||Geralt found his meeting with the Bloody Baron quite peculiar, and the baron himself not so bloody at all. Or did it just seem so? In any case, it turned out Ciri had indeed visited Crow's Perch some time past, but further information about her was only available for a price.<br>
   1046078|00000000||Nilfgaard's agent had determined Ciri had stayed with the baron - the self-proclaimed ruler of Velen. This man was known for his violent temper and three-mile-long cruel streak, hence his moniker: the Bloody Baron.

   1054993|00000000||Geralt stopped by a certain Novigrad book merchant whose owner recognized him at once. He said someone had left a book with him a long time ago with instructions to give it to Geralt if he ever got the chance. This naturally piqued the witcher's curiosity. Sadly, the book dealer did not know the book's exact present location, only that it had a red cover and that Geralt should look for it in his stacks of dusty tomes and manuscripts.<br>
   1054994|00000000||Geralt found the book and, inside it, a letter from someone he had once known. Though he gave no outward sign of it, this filled him with touching recollections of old times.

   1083241|00000000||As it turned out, the druid Ermion had no intention of letting the sorceress examine the destroyed woods. Geralt and Yennefer sought out Jarl Crach an Craite, who helped them break down the druid's resolve.

To know what forest paths deer are like to trod, to know in what muck boars will wallow, to guess when a hare will emerge from its burrow - that is half the battle.<br><br>What most men do not know is that some monsters also possess such knowledge. For example, a royal wyvern from Velen had learned the danger of exposing itself to human eyes and arrows by flying high to pick out its prey from afar. Instead, it would lurk by the roadside and wait for military transports. In this way it grew fat on salted pork and beer, expanding until it resembled a dragon more than other, lesser members of its own kind.<br><br>The witcher thus knew this beast would be much stronger and more resilient than a normal wyvern. Even one blow from it could kill - which is why he would need to avoid its charge at all costs. He would also be wise to force it to the ground with his crossbow or a bomb whenever it tried to fly into the air and hurtle down in a deadly dive.

One can, however, force them to reassume a physical presence by trapping them with the Yrden Sign or by hitting them with slivers from a Moon Dust bomb. As with any such ghostly being, one should fight them using silver swords, preferably ones smeared with a thick coat of specter oil. Note as well that wraiths are particularly dangerous on moonless nights.

   1048667|00000000||The baron treated Ciri like a daughter - no, better - for slaughtering a boar is sadly a delight few fathers think to share with their daughters. His men took an immediate liking to her as well, mainly due to her hunting prowess and passion for horses. One evening, as they were celebrating a successful hunt around a bonfire, Ciri proposed a wager: if she beat the baron in a horse race, he would give her a mount of her choosing. The baron accepted the challenge.<br>
   1048668|00000000||The race was meant as a harmless diversion, but soon took a different turn. Ciri and the baron, riding neck and neck, had just caught sight of the tower serving as the finish line when suddenly a basilisk landed at its base and turned its terrifying gaze upon them.

   1035071|00000000||About those cards…
   1035072|00000000||You got them?
   1035069|00000000||Not yet.
   1035070|00000000||Agh, so why're ye here? Miss me that much? This is no time for chit-chat, Geralt. We need to get those cards!
   1035073|00000000||Got the Isengrim card.
   1037798|00000000||Show it here. Hah! They say elves are beautiful… Zed give you much trouble?
   1037800|00000000||Zed's dead. I ran into his murderers.
   1035074|00000000||Won't cry over spilt Zed. What about the other cards?
   1038733|00000000||This business is getting dangerous.
   1038739|00000000||Zoltan, sure this business isn't getting a little too dangerous? I mean, men are dying over these cards.
   1038741|00000000||Just Zed. And believe you me, he wasn't an innocent bystander.
   1038743|00000000||Sides, I'm certain you snuffed his killers out on the spot, so why worry? Tell me about the other cards, instead.
   1038732|00000000||Didn't find the others.
   1038735|00000000||Didn't find the other cards.
   1038737|00000000||Fuck, bugger musta sold them!
   1035086|00000000||Uhh, Zed's killers did say something about a ledger.
   1035087|00000000||Ah, that's it! Zed musta written it all down. Bring me that ledger.
   1035081|00000000||Listen. Got Zed's ledger.
   1035082|00000000||Show me. Hmmm… Entries show him sellin' the cards to Caesar Bilzen and Ravvy. Ach, coulda been worse. We need to pay 'em a visit.
   1038794|00000000||Zoltan, seems awful important to you… I'll try to get you those cards.
   1038795|00000000||Thanks, Geralt. We can see Caesar together. Meet me outside his townhouse - gaudiest eyesore on Hierarch Square, he had the façade painted gold.
   1038796|00000000||And if you wanna see Ravvy first, I'd look for him at the Golden Sturgeon if I were you.
   1038797|00000000||All right. See you later.
   1038798|00000000||And no need to pussyfoot around with Ravvy. Beat 'im about the ears a bit, he'll cave. Well, good luck to ye, Geralt.
   1038788|00000000||Try to get you those cards.
   1038777|00000000||Ravvy - who's he?
   1038791|00000000||A common card sharp and a swindler. Boggles my mind where he got the coin for the Natalis card.
   1038793|00000000||Ever since I gave 'im a smackin', things between us have been frosty, so you'll have to see him alone.
   1038766|00000000||Ravvy? Who's that?
   1071396|00000000||Zoltan, think I've done what I was supposed to do. Gotta see to some other matters.
   1071398|00000000||Shame, as I could use some help. But… well, change your mind, come and see me.
   1054649|00000000||Rather not get involved.
   1035084|00000000||Who's Caesar Bilzen?
   1038768|00000000||Who's Caesar Bilzen?
   1038770|00000000||Cleaver's clerk. A decent fellow, once, but so high and mighty now you can't drink with 'im, let alone go' fishin'.
   1039141|00000000||Fishing?
   1039142|00000000||We met at the anglers' club - "The Pride of the Pontar." But Caesar don't show 'round there no more. So caught up in his new role, he almost never leaves his house.
   1038774|00000000||Least we won't have to run around town looking for him.
   1035068|00000000||About those cards…

   1049219|00000000||Wind-whipped and rain-battered, Geralt stumbled into a small village on the coast of An Skellig. The foul weather, he learned, had cursed this spot ever since a mysterious tower appeared one morning out of thin air, as if placed by an invisible giant's hand. Intrigued, Geralt decided to investigate.<br>
   1049220|00000000||The tower, as one might have predicted, was endowed with magic. To be precise, it was equipped with a Defensive Regulatory Magicon, a mystical apparatus that treated every entrant save the tower's original owner as a dangerous intruder. That is why it had locked Sigo Buntz, the Koviri mage who had purchased the tower at auction, in a cell inside his new property. It tried to do the same with Geralt, but to a determined witcher, a tower full of magic trickery is no obstacle.<br><br>Following Sigo's instructions, Geralt found a tome in the depths of the library entitled "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire." He and the mage used the secrets contained within to disable the tower's defenses. Once free, Sigo, bursting with gratitude, rewarded Geralt (generously, I hope, for the witcher never said exactly how), transported him in a flash to the village where it had all started (well, to be precise, to the bay off the coast from the village), then whisked the tower away for good. Once it was gone, all that remained of the storm were a few puddles and scattered clouds in the otherwise bright and sunny sky. The gathered villagers went wild with joy and showered Geralt with well-deserved thanks.
   1053618|00000000||While traversing the An Skellig coast, Geralt suddenly found himself beset by a fierce storm. A tower stuck awkwardly out of a nearby hill, and, though his medallion tingled as he neared it, Geralt decided to seek shelter there from the driving rain…<br>

The baron described her as a charming young maid of nineteen summers and the apple of his eye. No wonder, then, that the lord of Crow's Perch was desperate to find her.<br>
   1058799|00000000||Yet it seemed Tamara had finally had enough of the way the baron treated her mother and decided to flee along with her.<br>
   1058800|00000000||Geralt found his way to a hut belonging to a fisherman who had helped Tamara and her mother in their flight. There he learned that a horrible beast had captured Anna and dragged her into the swamp. Tamara was able to escape with her life, and had found shelter with a relative of the fisherman in Oxenfurt.<br>
   1058801|00000000||Tamara had indeed made it to Oxenfurt safe and sound and would not even consider returning to her father. Determined to save her mother from the clutches of the creatures that had imprisoned her in the bog, Tamara had joined the ranks of the witch hunters, hoping their support would allow her to survive a trek into Crookback Bog.<br>
   1058802|00000000||Tamara and her escort of witch hunters made it to the swamp clearing, but what she found there was no cause for joy, to say the least. The Crones no longer controlled her mother, true, but the experience had left her with an addled mind.<br><br>Tamara's father, the Bloody Baron, whom hithertofore she had held in contempt, took the high ground this time and swore to travel to the ends of the earth to search out even the slightest hope of returning Anna to a sound mind. Though Tamara did not want to admit it, she appreciated her father's gesture.<br>
   1058803|00000000||Tamara and her escort of witch hunters made it to the swamp clearing and there, to her great astonishment, was her father, who had also set out to free Anna. This family reunion was not, however, to be a moment of celebration - though Anna regained human form and a sound mind for a brief moment, she had only enough strength to bid farewell to her loved ones before passing on.<br>
   1058804|00000000||Tamara and her escort of witch hunters made it to the swamp clearing and there, to her great astonishment, was her father, who had also set out to free Anna. This family reunion was not, however, to be a moment of celebration.<br><br>Tamara became the unwilling witness to the her mother's grim death, and the harsh words she directed at Geralt and her father left no particular hope that she would soon be over the grief of this loss.<br>

   1054853|00000000||Every story, even the longest epic, must end, and so this one too now nears its conclusion. Geralt and his friends had acquired the Sunstone and secured the help of Fringilla Vigo. In other words, the long and dangerous process of preparing was over at last and everything was in place for the final battle against the Wild Hunt. All that remained was to summon the Naglfar to the shores of Undvik - and straight into their trap.<br>
   1054854|00000000||Every plan looks best on paper. It was no different this time - though every last detail had been seen to, our heroes were still in for many an unexpected danger and difficult moment. Their division of elite Nilfgaardian soldiers was frozen in ice before it could board the Naglfar. Ciri, who was supposed to stay out of the fighting, was forced into the fray to save Geralt. Meanwhile glory-seeking, fearless (or reckless, some might say) Skelligers rushed into the bay to fight both the riders of the Hunt and the Imperial Fleet at the same time.<br><br>Despite all these complications, in the end the allies defeated the Wild Hunt and Geralt slew its king with his own hands. It was too early to rejoice, however - right before his death Eredin revealed that Avallac'h had betrayed the witcher and had his own nefarious plans for Ciri. Geralt did not know whether to trust his enemy's words - but circumstances did not allow for long and careful deliberation.

   1061675|00000000||Emperor Emhyr had once presented the mages of Nilfgaard with a simple choice: either serve their country unquestioningly or die in prison.<br><br>Fringilla Vigo, a mistress of magic holding office in the vassal duchy of Toussaint, refused both options and instead joined the infamous Lodge of Sorceresses, whose aim was to stand up to the dictates of kings and emperors. These bold ambitions were never fulfilled, however, and Fringilla Vigo lived in fear that her ties to this subversive organization would be discovered and she would meet a quick end at the hands of the emperor's executioners. <br><br><br>One must mention here that Geralt first met Fringilla at the ducal palace in Beauclair many years ago, when we were there enjoying the hospitality of my one-time love, Duchess Anna Henrietta. The witcher, always a sucker for sorceresses, conjoined with Madame Vigo during this time in a quite lively relationship that surely was no cause of joy for Triss or Yennefer.<br>
   1061676|00000000||All indications were that Fringilla had been arrested and remained in a Nilfgaardian prison, undoubtedly awaiting execution for acts of high treason.<br>
   1061677|00000000||She was later released, however, thanks to a bargain Yennefer had struck with Emhyr.<br>

Such was the case in Byways, where a few peasants, unaware of the dangers they faced, awoke an unusually dangerous ekimmara.<br><br>The witcher knew this monster would be no easy kill. That the vampire would quickly regenerate, that its blows would cause heavy bleeding, that it was able to disappear into thin air. Yet he also knew he could overcome these advantages. He needed merely use the Yrden and Quen Signs and strike heavy blows. Oh, and avoid getting killed.

   1059809|00000000||Imlerith - a general of the Wild Hunt and a frequent guest in Geralt's nightmares - had been chasing Ciri for quite some time, striving to deliver her to his ruler, Eredin.<br><br>This powerful and brutal warrior had fought in the countless battles and campaigns for conquest waged by the Aen Elle in other worlds. He prized physical confrontation above all else, seeking out direct, bloody skirmishes where opponents pit their strength, agility and training against each other in a contest to the death.<br>
   1059810|00000000||Imlerith attacked Kaer Morhen along with the rest of the Hunt. There the keep's defenders witnessed heart-wrenching proof of this warrior's dangerous might. Vesemir, who had spent most of his long life with a sword in his hand, heroically stood to fight this foe but, to everyone's great despair, was bested after a bloody and hard-fought confrontation and perished at this monster's hands.<br>
   1059811|00000000||Regardless of race or birth, most warriors share common desires and delights. Imlerith was no exception. Avallac'h informed Ciri that he was wont to wallow in corporeal pleasures and would take advantage of his stay in our world to attend the Crones' sabbath.<br>
   1059820|00000000||Geralt and Ciri thus decided to meet him there and engage him in a final confrontation. Geralt won this battle, killing Imlerith and thus avenging the death of his master, Vesemir.<br>

   1061602|00000000||The wave of religious and racially-motivated killings that swept through Novigrad in the spring of 1272 coincided with Hubert Rejk's term as coroner at the city morgue.<br><br>Because of this he was overworked and additionally had to bear the harassment of his dislikeable superior, Reverend Nathaniel. It is thus no surprise that he came across as unpleasant and sarcastic when Geralt and he first met.<br><br>Furthermore, it was clear there was bad blood between him and Joachim von Gratz, a fact that did little to improve the already rather stiff atmosphere at the morgue. Nevertheless, having learned the reason for Geralt's unexpected visit, Hubert made it clear Geralt and Joachim could count on his help.<br>
   1061603|00000000||It turned out that Hubert had once been Von Gratz's teacher and mentor. Yet when Von Gratz's involvement in the student movement led to bloodshed, Hubert felt he had no choice but to denounce his advisee in order to avoid an escalation of violence.<br>
   1061604|00000000||Hubert proposed to help the witcher perform an autopsy on the serial killer's latest victim, which revealed valuable new clues.<br>
   1061605|00000000||Rejk might have succeeded in shifting the blame to another suspect if not for the witcher's perspicacity. Geralt had already figured out Rejk was the true murderer, but was shocked to learn he was also a powerful vampire.<br><br>Luckily Geralt had considerable experience and a honed skill set to draw on for fighting such a creature. He killed the beast and ended his twisted moral crusade.<br>
   1061606|00000000||When it turned out Rejk had been behind the murders from the very start, Geralt could only curse his short-sightedness and stupidity. It was too late to repair his earlier mistakes. The crazed fanatic escaped justice and left to continue his sick moral crusade elsewhere.<br>

   1060179|00000000||When Geralt encountered a misshapen midget at the Bloody Baron's court, he didn't think much of it. Yet when he heard a similarly deformed being had washed up on Skellige's shores in the same boat in which Ciri and her mysterious companion had sailed off shortly prior, he connected the two at once. It was clear this rough-hewn hunk of flesh was the key to finding Cirilla.<br>
   1060180|00000000||Geralt learned that, prior to arriving at Crow's Perch, Uma had briefly been the possession of Donar, jarl of Hindarsfjall. At some point, however, Donar sold Uma to a merchant from Novigrad, who thought the strange little creature would make a wonderful jester. This must have been the same merchant who then lost Uma to the Bloody Baron in a hand of cards.<br>
   1060182|00000000||We all breathed a sigh of relief to learn that Uma's twisted body and mind were no cruel joke played by nature, but the result of a curse. Now we needed only find a way to lift it…<br>
   1060474|00000000||Geralt didn't know exactly what the deformed being that had sailed to Skellige in Ciri's boat was. He had no doubt, however, that it was somehow tied to her fate - and just might be the key to finding her.<br>
   1060475|00000000||It turned out the diminutive freak had spent some time in the possession of Donar, jarl of Hindarsfjall. Later Donar sold him to a Novigrad merchant who thought he was perfect material for a top-notch jester.<br>
   1060486|00000000||Based on Skjall's detailed description, Geralt was able to recognize the creature at the Baron's castle as the very same deformed midget Skjall saw on Hindarsfjall.<br><br>Sadly, it was impossible to communicate with this "Uma" (as the creature had come to be called). He seemed to dwell in a world all his own.  Yet Geralt knew only Uma held the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1060497|00000000||We all breathed a sigh of relief to learn that Uma's twisted body and mind were no cruel joke played by nature, but the result of a curse. Now we needed only find a way to lift it…<br>
   1060502|00000000||Though Yennefer and Vesemir agreed Uma was suffering from a powerful curse,  they could not reach a consensus about how to go about lifting it. Sharp words were exchanged before Vesemir stepped in and announced that before Yennefer did anything he would try one of the traditional witcher methods.<br><br>All that was left to the others was to wait.<br>
   1060503|00000000||Though Vesemir's method had worked to disenchant the famous Swan of Poviss, it brought no breakthrough here. Vesemir did, however, succeed in confirming that Uma's body was a sort of magic prison in which some other being was trapped.<br><br>Yennefer's method did not prognosticate a high chance for Uma's survival - yet was now the only remaining option for lifting the curse.<br>
   1060507|00000000||The ritual succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. The person cursed inside Uma turned out to be none other than Avallac'h, a powerful elven Sage the witcher had met before.
   1060181|00000000||Sadly, there was no communicating with Uma. The gnarled twiglet lived in his own miniature world. Yet Geralt knew Uma was the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's stunted lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1059709|00000000||Uma
   1083237|00000000||As the emperor's spies told it, Ciri had reached Novigrad. No lone attempt to find her in the North's largest city could every make sense. But Geralt had friends he could count on. The witcher decided to contact Triss Merigold.

    387254|00000000||So, how will this ritual work?
    474664|00000000||A decoction the pellar shall brew, and when midnight tolls, off we go, to the sacred ground in the woods.
    474666|00000000||Mhm… We gonna need black candles?
    387326|00000000||"Step onto the paths of blood anight, standing upon bare ground, facing the old gods." 'Tis not unlike Forefathers' Eve.
    474668|00000000||All right. What then?
    387454|00000000||The pellar shall summon the spiritling, the babe's ghost, and it shall be our guide. And then… then you shall see something few these days witness.
    387244|00000000||How's this gonna work?
    387246|00000000||Need anything else?
    387248|00000000||Can I help? Bring any other ingredients?
    400384|00000000||Hmm-hmm… Henbane… yes. Jimsonweed… aye. And lungwort. Ah, here's the lungwort.
    387250|00000000||Milk, why, Princess shall provide, and a pellar's always got hen's feet. But, but… Eau-de-vie, fear that's all gone.
    413649|00000000||Ah! There's some hooch left! Do just fine. So, that's everything.
    474655|00000000||Blood, blood, blood… The pellar knows, knows the ritual, ritual to summon the spirits. The pellar will take the blood.
    400369|00000000||Botchling's blood - got some.
    400371|00000000||Got the botchling's blood. Know what to do? How to find Anna and Tamara?

   1081316|00000000||The monster tormenting the residents of Crow's Perch turned out to be a particularly nasty cockatrice. Geralt was not surprised the baron's men had been unable to stop it. They could not possibly withstand the surgical precision of its strikes, which slice open arteries and provoke an outpouring of blood only the Swallow potion could hope to stop. Neither did they know to force it to the ground with a crossbow, a bomb or a Sign, and then evade its charge by rolling under the monster's outstretched wing.

    432587|00000000||Ciri's trail took Geralt to Novigrad, the largest city in the North. It would take seas of ink to describe the city accurately, so suffice it to say it is the seat of the Church of the Eternal Fire, a bustling port city and a haven for artists… and all sorts of other shady characters.<br><br>Yet Novigrad at this time was not the city Geralt knew from his earlier travels. War raged throughout the known world, and rich cities often prove tempting morsels to armies on the march. It was clear at this time that this particular morsel had both Radovid and Emhyr greedily licking their chops. Within the city, the Temple Guard acted with impunity under the command of a cankerous snot named Caleb Menge and with the support of that terror-spreading band of zealots, the witch hunters. Meanwhile, the kingpins of the city's underworld still held much of it in their sleazy grasp.<br><br>Finding Ciri here would be like searching for a needle in a burning haystack - Geralt would clearly need some assistance. Luckily, an old acquaintance of his now lived in Novigrad. Her name was Triss Merigold.<br>
    432588|00000000||Ever since Radovid had given the witch hunters a free hand, the persecution of mages had ascended to new heights everywhere in the North - and Novigrad was no exception. The smell of burning flesh filled the air as the witch hunters set fire to freaks and mages of all kinds during gruesome public spectacles. Triss had been forced into hiding, and Geralt was forced to go to great lengths to find her. When he finally did, she was glad to see a friendly face, even one that brought back some still-painful memories.<br><br>Triss had no knowledge where Ciri might have gone, but she did know an individual who could be of help - a dreamer named Corinne Tilly.

   1077604|00000000||<i>Cremation, now that's one thing men could learn from gnomes. Burying bodies out in the fields, why, it's like laying out a welcome mat for monsters! Best case scenario, some ghouls will sniff them out, eat their fill and be on their ghoulish way. But if, gods forbid, a grave hag takes to feeding at your cemetery, you'll have no end of trouble." <br>– </i>Jacques de Villepin, Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Few monsters' names fit as well as the grave hags'. As one might guess, these creatures resemble aged, deformed women and loiter near graveyards and battlefields. Grave hags feed on human corpses and in particular on the rotten marrow which they slurp from human bones using their long, prehensile tongues. Once a hag has devoured all corpses within reach, she turns to killing men and burying them in the cemetery as she waits for them to decompose.<br>
   1077605|00000000||Grave hags use their tongues in combat to grab or flog their victims. Claws built for digging up buried bodies serve just as well as weapons to rend flesh. Though clumsy in appearance, grave hags move and attack at great speed – sometimes even a witcher's reflexes are too slow to avoid their blows.<br><br>Grave hags are territorial creatures. Their lairs resemble caricatures of human homes and are built near burial sites. They venture out at night to hunt, stalking straggling travelers or mourners too lost in their grief to notice the setting of the sun. On rare occasions hunger-driven grave hags will hunt during the day. They are less dangerous at such times, for sunlight weakens them considerably.

   1083233|00000000||While searching for the witch Ciri had quarelled with, Geralt ran into an old friend - Keira Metz. The sorceress told the witcher about a masked mage with a hideout, where Ciri was supposed to have hidden. The witcher set off for the hideout with Keira in tow.
   1083234|00000000||Ciri had, in fact, never reached the elven mage – yet the Wild Hunt had. The ghostly retinue was one step ahead of Geralt - or so it seemed. Geralt felt that all was lost, until Keira gave him a new lead - the Crones of Crookback Bog.

   1051952|00000000||While traversing the woods outside Novigrad, Geralt came across some monster tracks that struck him as unusual. He decided it was worth his time to see what sort of beast was prowling around this close to the North's great metropolis.<br>
   1051953|00000000||A certain halfling named Brean Hotsch had hung a notice stating he was in need of a professional monster slayer. Geralt decided to see what was the matter.<br>
   1051954|00000000||After a detailed investigation of the shrubbery and thicketry lining the forest floor (what exactly he looks for during such investigations is a complete mystery to me - I see nothing but endless chances to tear one's hose), Geralt concluded he was tracking a leshen. In order to defeat this elusive monster, he would first need to provoke it into attacking him. That's right, dear reader: he planned to deliberately provoke a leshen - the very thought sends shivers down my spine.<br>
   1051955|00000000||Once Geralt had defeated the leshen, the halfling paid up without making any fuss. There's no denying it: Brean Hotsch proved himself an honorable individual.

   1059791|00000000||Baroness Maria Louisa la Valette was the talk of Temeria in her time.

   1059792|00000000||Sadly, this siege led to the death of the baroness' eldest son. Sword in hand he had fought to defend his mother's honor but fell to Geralt of Rivia, who was with King Foltest at the time.<br><br>No one could blame Louisa la Valette for harboring a deep-seated hatred for the witcher, a hatred which became quite apparent the next time they crossed paths.<br>
   1059795|00000000||To the baroness' good fortune Geralt of Rivia was with King Foltest at the time and saved her son Aryan from the fate that otherwise would have been his for having participated in the revolt.<br><br>Louisa la Valette thus had every reason to think quite highly of the witcher and her esteem became quite apparent the next time they crossed paths.

    397262|00000000||<i>Patients seem to have hallucinations of a woman covered in scabs and boils, with rats scurrying about all around her. These ravings subsided after an administration of henbane and poppy extract." </i><br>– Joachim von Gratz's notes, Vilmerius Hospital in Novigrad<br><br>When plague ravages a region, a spirit will sometimes walk its lands, a ghost resembling an ill woman whose flesh rots off her bones and in whose wake crawls a cavalcade of rats. No one knows whether this spirit brings the pox with her or is merely drawn to it like a moth to a light. Yet it is certain that she delights in dealing pain and suffering, in hearing the howling and moaning of men.<br>
   1077289|00000000||Many have called into question the very existence of plague maidens, or pestae, as they are sometimes called. Only two sightings of such a creature have ever been recorded, both during times of raging epidemic.<br><br>As the name "plague maiden" suggests, these wraiths take the appearance of females, though exactly why that is remains a mystery. Some speculate they, like other such specters, arise from the powerful emotional charge associated with certain circumstances of death, such as death preceded by a long and particularly painful illness.<br><br>Not much is known about how to fight a plague maiden, though one can assume they possess many traits in common with other phantoms and wraiths. They undoubtedly pose a great danger, though a witcher's immunities should at least prevent him from catching the contagious illnesses they carry.

   1060736|00000000||Skellige sagas brim with praise for war chiefs and warrior-braves of ages past, yet the saga of Crach, jarl of Clan an Craite and lord of Kaer Trolde, will outshine them all. It will sing of his strength, his courage, his wisdom, his generosity, his loyalty to friends and his relentless pursuit of his foes.<br><br>There will be few exaggerations in such a tale, for Crach, the mightiest of Skellige's jarls, truly did possess all the traits of a hero. He aroused terror in his enemies - in fact, Nilfgaardian mothers would use his name to frighten their children into obedience, and all in that empire spoke in hushed tones of the infamous Tirth ys Muire, the Wild Boar of the Sea, who devastated coastal provinces during frequent and terrible raids.<br><br>Geralt had known Crach for long, since a time when as a young man the jarl had sought the hand of young Pavetta, Ciri's mother.<br>
   1060737|00000000||After Bran's demise, Crach could easily have claimed the throne for himself. Yet he preferred to support the claim of his son, Hjalmar. When his daughter Cerys announced her intention to seek the throne as well, the jarl also gave her his support, showing no favoritism when it came to his children.<br>
   1060743|00000000||To the islanders, honor is the most prized of virtues. Crach thus agreed without hesitation to live up to the pledge he made many years ago on behalf of himself and his entire clan and supported the search for Cirilla with any means Skellige could offer.<br>
   1060744|00000000||Crach also did not balk when the time came to stand and fight Eredin. Though Eredin killed Crach during this fight, the jarl's death did not break the islanders' spirit, instead becoming a model of how to die like a true hero.<br>

   1050584|00000000||Of all the so-called "witches" they hunted, there was none the witch hunters wanted more than Triss Merigold, a sorceress of unequaled power. Even in hiding she had proven a thorn in their side, masterminding an underground net of hideouts and covers, keeping other mages out of the hunters' blood-stained hands. When Geralt entered the city, he met up with his dear friend and sometime love. And when the time came that she needed his help with her endeavor, she did not hesitate to ask.<br>
   1050585|00000000||Their contact revealed that the son of Ingrid Vegelbud, scion of a wealthy Novigrad family, dabbled in alchemy. For that reason he had become a person of much interest to the witch hunters. When Ingrid learned of Triss' operations, she sent her servant to ask the sorceress to spirit her son somewhere far away from his persecutors. The hunters kept a close eye on her residence, so they would need a distraction - and her upcoming masquerade ball promised to provide just that.<br>
   1050776|00000000||Young Albert's rescue did not prove to be Triss' slickest extraction ever. First she had trouble even finding the young alchemist amidst the throng of revelers, and then Geralt ran into trouble with a group of witch hunter infiltrators. Still, with a bit of luck and a bit of cunning our heroes managed to escape the residence and smuggle Vegelbud out without a scratch on him. Mission accomplished. Geralt and Triss had proven once again how well they work together as a team - but as a couple, well, events at the Vegelbuds' only complicated that matter...<br>
   1054588|00000000||Geralt and Triss attended the masquerade ball at the Vegelbuds' residence. Their mission: rescue young Albert. Geralt, however, must have downed one cocktail too many and wandered off before they could fulfill it. Albert was arrested. Triss was furious with Geralt - and much water flowed under Saint Gregory's Bridge before she forgave him.<br>
   1086762|00000000||She had received a very tempting proposition and needed Geralt to accompany her to the Novigrad fish market. A fish market, you say? Had the hunters taken to persecuting flounder as well? Was a mage in desperate need of some herring? I will ignore the sarcasm in your tone and tell you this: the mysterious man awaiting them there would provide answers to all these questions - and more.<br>
   1087089|00000000||At first everything went smoothly and Triss truly believed that, with the witcher's help, she would successfully sneak Albert Vegelbud out of the city, thus saving his life. Yet there was one thing she did not foresee: that Geralt would prove the weak link in her plan and fail to show up at the ball. No one likes being stood up, least of all a sorceress. Thus a lot of water flowed under St. Gregory's Bridge before she let go of her anger...
   1054587|00000000||Their contact did indeed await them at the fish market but - prepare yourselves - at the last minute Geralt changed his mind and ran off on some other errand. Geralt's fickle-heartedness led to tragedy - unknown evildoers killed the informant. Triss had no way to follow up on her proposition, and so was understandably furious with the witcher.<br>

   1083666|00000000||The one person in Velen who could help Geralt battle the Wild Hunt was Keira Metz. The witcher hoped their longstanding relationship and the sorceress' concern for the fate of the world would incline her to take part in the battle.<br>
   1083667|00000000||Yet it turned out Keira was too absorbed in her own troubles to go to Kaer Morhen. Geralt had to continue on without her.
   1083668|00000000||Though Keira might come off as haughty and self-obsessed to some, in her heart of hearts she was completely different. Geralt knew which cords to pluck in order to get her to agree to help. After their conversation, the sorceress promised to stand and fight at Kaer Morhen.

    547584|00000000||Geralt can hardly spend a day in even the most seemingly idyllic village without being asked to kill a monster, so it should come as no surprise such requests came to him in Novigrad as well. On one occasion he was asked to clean a warehouse of nekkers. The two owners - a man and a dwarf - blamed each other for attracting the monsters there in a plot to gain sole control over the building.<br>
   1051274|00000000||After examining all the evidence, Geralt decided the dwarf was at fault.<br>

   1048666|00000000||While trekking up the former riverbed, Ciri came across a girl named Gretka. The child spoke in a quivering voice of the fearsome Wolf King, who, in a twist straight out of a spine-tingling ballad, prowled the very path they needed to travel.<br><br>The Wolf King, it turned out, was in truth a common werewolf.

   1048587|00000000||Ciri's spirits were high after killing Imlerith, but Geralt knew this fight had been but an appetizer before the full course of battle still to come. As part of their preparations, Geralt and Ciri rode to Novigrad, where Triss and Yennefer were trying to reconvene the Lodge of Sorceresses. Avallac'h was waiting there as well, and had his own ideas how to tip the scales of victory in our allies' favor during their final confrontation with Eredin...<br>

   1053214|00000000||On one of Skellige's beaches, Geralt ran into a man desperately fending off an enraged assailant. The witcher could hardly look upon this spectacle impassively and decided to help. After the fight, Ivar, for this was the man's name, admitted his attacker had been the brother of the woman Ivar loved. He had sought to kill Ivar for seducing his sister, who was a priestess of Freya and thus bound by custom to a live a life of chastity. Ivar, however, refused to let religion stand in the way of his love and aimed to scour learned books for a precedent that would help him negotiate his beloved's release from her vows. Geralt agreed to bring him any relevant books he found.<br>

   1072910|00000000||Ves was a veteran officer of the Blue Stripes and the only soldier from Roche's former unit to have survived the war. After the Blue Stripes were decimated and officially disbanded, Ves remained at her commander's side to continue with him the seemingly hopeless struggle for Temerian freedom.<br><br>Energetic and tough, Ves had always impressed with her skill with crossbow and sword alike, outshooting and outswinging all the men in her unit to a laughable degree.<br>
   1072913|00000000||Though usually well-disciplined, Ves refused to heed Vernon's command and set off alone to face enemy forces.<br>
   1072914|00000000||Sadly, help came too late and the fierce warrior paid for her hot-headedness with her life.<br>
   1072915|00000000||Ves' rash move landed her in a horrible pot of trouble that only Geralt's sword could dish her out of.<br>
   1072916|00000000||Even had Ves not owed Geralt her life, she would have come to the defense of Kaer Morhen all the same, for she would follow Vernon Roche into the very bowels of the abyss.<br>
   1072917|00000000||Ves had been a soldier all her life, a fact which made her unfortunate death during a political intrigue even bitterer. At least one part of her death matched her life: she fell at her commander's side.

   1048592|00000000||Cities like Novigrad have their own, special magic. They attract folk from all corners of the world, becoming delicious stews of diverse flavors, giant circuses filled with colorful characters just waiting to extend a helping hand - or swing a sharp elbow. Ciri had experienced the fullness of this during her stay in Novigrad, so when she found herself back in the city she decided to repay a few debts - and settle a few scores...<br>
   1048595|00000000||First name on her list - Whoreson Junior. Though Geralt swore he had killed Whoreson with his own hands, rumor had it the mafioso was alive and well. Geralt and Ciri thus decided to pay him a surprise visit. They discovered Dudu had turned Whoreson's death into a prime business opportunity. He took on the underworld boss' form, and then took over his criminal organization, transforming it into a legal, and more profitable than ever, enterprise.<br>
   1050966|00000000||Geralt decided to accompany Ciri on her sentimental journey. First name on her list - Whoreson Junior. They finally found him wallowing in the gutter in the Bits. One look at his pathetic state and Ciri lost all desire for vengeance. Whoreson was a husk of a man, alone, disgraced and embittered, in no way resembling the old Whoreson Junior, member of the Big Four and terror of Novigrad. Ciri decided she could think of no worse fate for him and left him to it.<br>
   1050994|00000000||The next debt Ciri had to repay was with a young woman named Bea. She took an immediate liking to our friend the witcher, and he in turn was not left indifferent by her considerable charms. Ah, had they but world enough and time… But they hadn't, so Ciri and Geralt moved on to an itinerant circus troupe's camp outside Novigrad. <br><br>It was here that Valdo and his comrades had taken Ciri in when she had no place to stay and not a copper to her name. She was welcomed no less warmly upon her return. Valdo proposed she and Geralt stay for some friendly horseracing and a pleasant evening of drink and dance around the fire. Geralt knew they both could use a moment to catch their breath and accepted the invitation.<br>
   1050995|00000000||Our friends were eating, drinking and delighting in the joyful atmosphere of the circus performers' camp when a certain Aegar came to them and asked for help. He needed to steal some horses from a Novigrad merchant. Geralt did not think this was the sort of thing Ciri and he should be getting involved with, but Aegar wouldn't relent. One thing led to another and soon this petty disagreement had turned into an all-out brawl. Afterwards no one, Ciri least of all, was in a festive mood. She went for a riverside walk to cool her head, the circus performers returned to their tents and the witcher... well, the witcher took care of some witcher business.<br>

First the tense thrills of sneaking into the stables, then the mad joy of galloping off, the wind in their hair. A spark of happiness flashed in Ciri's eyes, the first in a long, long while.

   1051839|00000000||Craven's reanimated corpse told Geralt and Yennefer about Ciri's stay on Hindarsfjall. She had made a dramatic entrance, popping out of thin air in a narrow escape from some unknown danger. Exhausted and wounded, she was carried by a mysterious companion who then entrusted her into Craven's care. He took her home, where his family tended to her with warmth and kindness. For the first time in a very long while, Ciri had a moment to catch her breath and enjoy life's simple comforts.<br>
   1051858|00000000||Sadly, she was not given long to savor these blissful moments. The Wild Hunt had caught Ciri's scent. Dark clouds gathered in the sky, puddles began to ice over and the ruthless wraiths rode towards the village. Ciri knew she was in no shape to defeat her assailants. Craven, or rather Skjall, for that was the unfortunate lad's true name, decided to help her, putting his own life and honor at risk.<br><br>Ciri raced off to Drowned Dead Rock, where she rejoined her masked companion. From what Skjall could see the two got into some sort of quarrel, which the mysterious man ended by putting Ciri to sleep with a spell. He then set her down in a boat and sailed off with her into the thick fog blanketing the surrounding sea. <br><br> Ciri had thus escaped the Wild Hunt once again. Skjall was less fortunate - the wraiths had wounded him and left him for dead. Yet he had life in him still and fought his way back to consciousness. When his eyes opened, he saw he was lying on the beach near a boat - the very same vessel in which Ciri and her companion had sailed away the night before. Now it bore but a single, highly unusual passenger -- the ugliest man in the world.

   1061637|00000000||A dwarf, a soldier of fortune, a veteran of the Battle of Brenna, an unassailable optimist, a committed altruist, a lover of rough drinks and rougher songs, a master gwent player and, above all, a dear and loyal friend to me and Geralt - ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Zoltan Chivay. We first became fast friends years ago, when Geralt and I ran into Zoltan and the band he was leading at the time across war-stricken Riverdell.<br><br>It proved our fate to cross paths many times after, and we eventually became inseparable companions, sticking together through good and ill. At our tale's beginning Zoltan and I had gone into business together running a Novigrad tavern called the Rosemary and Thyme.<br>
   1061638|00000000||By saving me from the transport taking me to my doom Zoltan proved yet again he would never abandon a friend in need. In return, Zoltan soon found himself on the receiving end of an act of friendship. Suffering some financial difficulties, he had taken out a loan from one of the Novigrad mob bosses, and as a result had made many unfortunate enemies.<br><br>He planned to repay his debt by gathering a prize collection of gwent cards - a risky endeavor, given the cutthroat nature of Novigrad gwent circles at the time, and one that would have never worked without Geralt's help.<br>
   1061639|00000000||In another adventure that took place during this time, Geralt asked Zoltan to distract the guards at Deireadh prison. The planned ruse proved impossible to pull off, however, and so the dwarf resorted to more reliable, direct methods. His quick thinking considerably eased the witcher's getaway.<br>
   1072872|00000000||Zoltan naturally would never have sat out the defense of Kaer Morhen. In fact, I don't think he'd ever have forgiven Geralt if he'd been left out of the chance to smash some evil heads in good company.

   1055884|00000000||Malicious beings usually haunt the ruins of castles, fortresses or, as a last resort, towers. The wraith of White Orchard, however, chose a much more quotidian site for its haunting: a well. A White Orchard peasant by the name of Odolan wanted someone to chase off the phantom and Geralt accepted the job.<br>
   1055886|00000000||Though Geralt had rid the village of the noonwraith, he could not stop thinking about the unfortunate woman the phantom had once been. Who was responsible for her untimely death? What had she done to bring this upon herself? Just who was she? Thanks to the dedication inscribed on the bracelet he found in the cave, Geralt was able to get answers to these questions from White Orchard's herbalist. She recounted to him the story of the area's troubled past.<br>
   1055885|00000000||It turned out the devil haunting the well was a noonwraith: the ghost of a young woman who had died a sudden and cruel death. The witcher found her body hanging from the well's bucket rope and, nearby, a bracelet that must have belonged to her while she lived. Destroying this object broke the tie binding the poor woman's ghost to this world and allowed Geralt to chase it off once and for all.<br>
   1084262|00000000||In White Orchard Geralt happened across a notice posted by a certain Odolan residing in the village. The man wanted someone to take out the monster who was haunting the area around an old well - and doing so required a professional. This was as typical of witcher work as they come, so Geralt decided to talk to the man.<br>
   1062767|00000000||Sadly, the girl who was gripped by fever died before Geralt could get rid of the ghost keeping her from receiving the well's clean waters. All Geralt could do then was convey his condolences.<br>
   1058444|00000000||Malicious beings usually haunt the ruins of castles, fortresses or, as a last resort, towers. The wraith of White Orchard, however, chose a much more everyday site for her haunting: a well. Geralt decided to drive this being off - perhaps to prevent it from harming anyone dwelling nearby, or perhaps in hope that someone would pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1058474|00000000||Geralt found the body of the woman who had turned into the noonwraith hanging from the well's bucket rope and, nearby, a bracelet that had once belonged to her. Destroying this object broke the tie binding the poor woman's ghost to this world and allowed Geralt to chase it off once and for all. After he did this, he was pleased to learn there was a contract out for the monster's eradication, a bounty he collected with a sense of having performed his duties well.<br>

   1053026|00000000||At one point during his travels Geralt learned of a master alchemist named Gremist. Rumor had it this druid knew more about alchemy than most men know about the contours of their own members. Geralt, ever eager to polish his skills, decided to find this learned druid and absorb whatever knowledge from him he could.<br>
   1053027|00000000||This Gremist proved to be a strange individual, but then so do most mages and druids - routinely staring into the abyss of otherworldly power has that effect. Rather than let Geralt learn from him right away, he first forced him to undergo three trials. Geralt passed all three with flying colors and the druid had no choice but to take him on as an apprentice. Thus Geralt, showing an admirable commitment to lifelong learning, gathered his chalk and prepared his slate for some advanced alchemy lessons.

   1077913|00000000||<i>Again?! Good grief, woman, I'm spent…</i><br>– Lester of Smallton to a succubus, a few days before taking a vow of celibacy<br><br>Unlike other monsters, succubi and menads feel no desire to kill, do not crave human blood and usually do not, in fact, mean any harm at all. They are motivated by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable lust. They try in vain to slake this by engaging in sexual acts with any other humanoid species they encounter. While it must be admitted that their "victims" rarely put up much resistance, this does not mean succubi and menads do not present any danger: their never-ending advances, though pleasurable at first, have pushed more than one man to madness or even death.<br>
   1077914|00000000||Succubi and menads usually can be found near human settlements, including small villages and populous cities. They prowl at night, though when stricken by serious need they will leave their lairs during the day as well. They shower their affections on men as well as women, the young as well as the old, the ugly as well as the beautiful. Some of them are particularly fond of pastors and other holy men, whose seduction they treat as a sort of game.<br><br>Though succubi are peaceful by nature, when forced to fight they will defend themselves fiercely. One should thus not be fooled by their fair appearance – under the velvety skin of their arms lie muscles of iron, and a blow delivered with their rear, goat-like legs or the thick horns on their head can easily crush bone.

   1077570|00000000||<i>When at the water's edge, you gotta be quiet. First of all, so as not to scare the fish. Second – so you don't attract drowners.</i><br>– Yanneck of Blaviken, fisherman<br><br>A drowner resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it. That is why it is often thought drowners - along with their more dangerous cousins: vodniks, mucknixers and drowned dead – arise from the bodies of those who drown in shallow water: lost travelers falling into bogs, children who swim too far from the shore or, in the case of vodniks, inebriated peasants who stumble off narrow swamp trails.<br>
   1077571|00000000||Like so many other beliefs about monsters, this one is false. While drowners do look like humans from a distance, witchers, who have the dubious pleasure of examining them from close quarters, have reported the numerous ways in which their anatomy differs from our own. Their scaly skin, gills and dorsal fins suggest drowners and their like are an entirely foreign species.<br><br>The adaptations mentioned above make drowners excellent swimmers, well-suited to the muddy waters of the ponds and lakes in which they dwell. They often cluster near human settlements, which are for them an excellent source of food.<br><br>Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. They can attack with lightning speed, taking their victim by surprise and pulling him into the water to drown. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling – at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.<br><br>Drowners, mucknixers, vodniks and drowned dead all live in putrid, rotting filth, and so have developed a high resistance to poison. Though humanoid in form, they are primitive creatures no more intelligent than carp or pike. That is why spells affecting the mind, the Axii Sign included, are ineffective against them. Yet they are particularly vulnerable to magic drawn from the element of fire, including the Igni Sign.

   1050664|00000000||At last, the day had come. The long interregnum was at an end. The jarls of Skellige had gathered to choose which of the claimants would be crowned King Bran's successor. Notable representatives from the clans and common Skelligers alike rubbed shoulders around the sacred oak on Hindarsfjall, eager to witness the coronation of their new ruler. Among them - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1050665|00000000||It was done. The Skelligers had spoken. Hjalmar an Craite was the Isles' new ruler. Many grumbled that this heralded a time of storms and imminent war with Nilfgaard. Others cheered, content in the thought that their young leader was backed by a sage and experienced advisor, his father - the cool pond of his wisdom to temper Hjalmar's red-hot steel. All agreed their new king was a warrior, strong and fearless, who would give not an inch to any invader.
   1050666|00000000||It was done. The Skelligers had spoken, choosing Cerys an Craite to be their new queen. Though in the past other women had sat on Skellige's throne, many islanders worried the turbulent times would simply overwhelm young Cerys. Others rejoiced at the outcome, believing Cerys' accession guaranteed that peace would one day reign in Skellige. Who was in the right? Time would soon tell…

Unfortunately, they were first greeted by an entirely different individual - a monster known as Morkvarg. It seemed Geralt once more would have to stain his silver sword with blood.<br>
   1056105|00000000||Freya's garden - once the pride of Hindarsfjall, nay, of all the Isles - had fallen into ruin. This had happened on account of a certain Morkvarg, a cruel pirate for whom nothing was sacred. The punishment for his deeds was a curse that transformed him into a monster and imprisoned him inside the garden walls. There he roamed for years until Freya's priestesses decided it was time to get rid of him for good. They promised a generous reward to any brave man who could drive him off - or, better yet, kill him.<br>
   1056106|00000000||The Skellige Isles have a long and rich history. Scattered throughout their rocky lands are many mysterious ruins, elven relics, ancient woods and natural marvels. One of the places that most stuck in Geralt's memory was the abandoned garden near Freya's temple. Geralt discovered it by accident, and found there was work waiting for him within - a powerful monster prowled inside its crumbling walls.<br>
   1056112|00000000||Geralt decided to try an innovative curse-lifting method - feeding the werewolf his own flesh. Geralt's efforts were a partial success. The curse was lifted, but Morkvarg died without ever reassuming his human form. Considering the hideous deeds this cruel pirate had wrought, one's heart does not exactly burst with pity for him.
   1056113|00000000||Geralt tracked down one of Morkvarg's former companions who lived in Larvik. His jaw dropped to learn this man - and not, as was commonly thought, Freya's high priestess - had cast the curse on the infamous pirate. The man also possessed an object he claimed could lift the curse. Geralt took it from him, and used it to return Morkvarg to human form - thus rendering him mortal. Geralt then struck an expert blow to hasten the inevitable end this condition implied. Clearly he felt that years of insatiable hunger were not punishment enough for this man's many sins.
   1056114|00000000||Geralt tracked down one of Morkvarg's former companions who lived in Larvik. His jaw dropped to learn this man - and not, as was commonly thought, Freya's high priestess - had cast the curse on the infamous pirate. The man also possessed an object he claimed could lift the curse. Geralt took it from him, used it to return Morkvarg to human form - and then let him go free. This might strike you as strange, dear reader, considering this former pirate's many sins and complete unwillingness to reform. Remember, however, that it is a witcher's job to kill monsters, not people, no matter how rotten they might be.
   1056111|00000000||Geralt learned the curse hadn't just turned Morkvarg into a monster - it had sentenced him to eternal hunger as well. He knew from decades of experience that such curses can be lifted by feeding the monster of one's own and unforced volition. In this case, however, the tried and true method did not work - the food scattered into ash as soon as Morkvarg brought it near his lips.<br>

   1061641|00000000||All witchers have a great deal in common, but with Eskel and Geralt, the similarities are particularly striking. They first met as two boys of the same age swinging wooden swords at Kaer Morhen. They then went through an ordeal together: the first round of selections, the murderous Changes, the Trial of the Grasses, and training on the Gauntlet - the witchers’ daunting obstacle course. They also received hidings together for more than one act of childish delinquency. When they became adults, they walked the Path separately, but still reconvened at Kaer Morhen nearly every winter to wait out the cold, drink to their successes and remember fallen comrades.<br><br>Though Eskel never gained Geralt’s renown, he equaled the White Wolf in experience and carried out his contracts with care and efficiency. Death had almost taken him many times during his hunts, yet in an ironic twist the hideous scar on his face came not from a monster’s claw but from the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his highly unpredictable Unexpected Child.<br>
   1061642|00000000||Perhaps this traumatic experience lay at the root of Eskel's dislike for Yennefer, though he tried not to let this get in the way of his friendship with Geralt.<br>
   1061643|00000000||Eskel took active part in the defense of Kaer Morhen, standing bravely in the face of overwhelming odds to fight one of the Hunt's generals. When Vesemir died, he took over responsibility for watching over the witchers' keep.

   1053100|00000000||The she-troll fell to Geralt's fists, earning him the title of the best fistfighter to be found. To this day his name is uttered with the utmost respect in the taverns of Skellige, the shady inns of Novigrad and the barnyards of Velen.

Some write wills, others pay off debts and still others make up with estranged relatives.<br><br>Nidas, a battle-hardened veteran from Novigrad, wanted to tie off a rather atypical loose end: acquiring the black pearl he had once promised his beloved wife. As he had reached an advanced age, he would not be able to journey to the black pearl beds of Skellige by himself - so he hired the witcher to assist him.<br>
   1053030|00000000||Geralt extracted a black pearl from a Skellige oyster with the skill of an experienced pearl diver, thus helping Nidas fulfill his promise. Sadly, it turned out his wife was unable to appreciate this lovely gesture - old age had deprived her of a sound mind and muddled her memories.

Ekimmaras, why, they ain't nothing more than overgrown bats.</i><br>– Anonymous city guardsman's last words<br><br>Like other vampires, ekimmaras are not, despite what village gossips might say, undead humans. They are instead post-Conjunction monsters who have no particular feelings about garlic, holy water or religious symbols.<br><br>Unlike their portrayals in ballads and legends, they look nothing like handsome, pale aristocrats with charming eastern accents, though, like katakans or nekurats, they do bear a strong resemblance to overgrown bats. They also do not suck blood from the necks of virgins with a delicate, kiss-like bite – they tear them to shreds using long, sharp claws and then slurp the splattered blood off the ground.
   1077672|00000000||Ekimmaras are unusually cruel and exceptionally swift. They are able to quickly land blow after blow capable of smashing even the best Mahakaman-made armor into tiny shards. They should be fought with a silver sword, remembering that they can regenerate back health over time. One should thus never attempt to tire them out or, gods forbid, wait for them to bleed to death. Instead, cut them down as quickly as possible and, if possible, burn the body to ash and scatter it to the four winds.

   1056068|00000000||No rabbits were snared that morning, but a forktail did meet its end. In any case, that did not prove the day's most important event. Ciri took Geralt for a walk that turned out to be the most momentous of his long life. She told him she had accepted the emperor's offer and would ride to Nilfgaard. There she would assume her rightful place as heir to the throne - next in line to be empress of the most powerful state in the world. A Nilfgaardian delegation awaited to take her to the City of Towers. And what happened then, you ask? What did fate have in store for Geralt and Ciri? That, dear reader, is another story.

   1078435|00000000||It is an innkeeper's job to tend to his guests' needs. Usually this takes the form of serving strong drinks and listening to tales of loves lost and wounds received. Yet at times a patron will wish to play a hand of gwent, which is why all good innkeepers keep a deck at the ready at all times. And the excellent ones - they keep excellent decks, full of top-notch cards that can provide an evening of challenge and excitement to even the most refined gwent player. Geralt was determined to win some of these cards for himself.<br>

   1077281|00000000||<i>Some men have got good reason to fear their own shadows.</i><br>– Svargmitt, An Skellig druid<br><br>Monsters most commonly claim innocents as their victims: tardy merchants, reckless children and travelers who wander into dark woodlands out of misplaced curiosity. None of the above need fear hyms, however. These wraiths only latch onto particularly despicable individuals who have committed some unspeakable crime. To all others, they remain completely invisible. When they do show themselves to the one they torment, they appear as a tall, shadow-clad, humanoid silhouette with long, sharp claws.<br>
   1077282|00000000||Yet hyms do not sink these claws into their victims. Instead, they sap their strength indirectly, through inflicting suffering. Speaking in a voice only the victim hears, they drive him to commit acts of violence, aggression and self-harm. A hym will seize on a guilty person's worst fears and weave out of them hideous visions, slowing driving the poor soul into madness. <br><br>Those tormented by a hym are incapable of restful sleep, for they are tormented by ever-more-frequent, incredibly-realistic nightmares. At times the victim will become extremely on edge, yelling pleas or threats at invisible phantoms or confessing his guilt out loud in the hope this will end his torment. This act does not, however, bring any relief, for the hym will not leave until it has addled its victim's wits completely or driven him to suicide.

   1049825|00000000||The search for Ciri had taken Yennefer to the wind-swept Skellige Isles - that is to say, lest your mind fill with visions of our elegant sorceress shivering on some barren rock - it had taken her to a suite of comfortable rooms near Kaer Trolde Castle on the isle of Ard Skellig. Geralt was to join her there and thus set off to the port in Novigrad, where he hoped to find a captain bold enough to brave the pirate-infested waters en route.<br>
   1049826|00000000||After much searching, Geralt found just such a man. A certain Captain Wolverstone had agreed to sail to Skellige. Whether he was abnormally brave or abnormally stupid is unknown - the vodka he gulped in buckets could have enhanced either quality. We can also hope it helped sooth his nerves when, to no one's surprise, pirates attacked the ship off the archipelago's shores. Geralt was thrown overboard during the tussle, and awoke face-down in the Skellige sand.
   1049829|00000000||Geralt recovered from his tumultuous landing and eventually reached Kaer Trolde castle - home to Crach, jarl of Clan an Craite. There he discovered all the notables of Skellige had gathered to bury King Bran, who had breathed his last a few days prior. In attendance as well: Yennefer.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Casteldaccia vineyard – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the ruins of the castle atop Mont Crane. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Filibert Fourfingers, wanted by writ of law in Belhaven, Metinna and Nazair, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 30% to take into account resort fees and immediate payment in species.

The cart needn't be big, can even be tiny, in fact, just so that two, or better four, people could fit in it, with ample room for bags and sacks, if possible. Could be old, long as it rides well and has new wheels, and strong axles, so actually probably nothing made longer than a year or two ago would do.<br><br>Leave a message with Bohddie.

The worst is that I’ve got to document it all, then hide the notes from the guards! Each escape must be noted down in detail – otherwise, my employers won’t have a basis for releasing my pay. The work of a professional escapologist is not easy, my friend.<br><br>25th Day of the Month of Birke<br>This time I was given a contract in Toussaint. This is going to be a piece of cake. The guards are fat and drowsy and the walls pocked... [illegible fragment] I was given a thorough hiding today. Those guards are fat and indolent, true, but they know how to whip. Blast, think I’m getting too old for this. I’ll finish this contract and then it’s time for a change of trades.<br><br>28th Day of the Month of Birke<br>Ha! I’m one lucky whoreson. My fellow inmate, a man wrongfully convicted, told me a story about an elven treasure trove hidden underwater somewhere south of the prison… I believe he sensed I was planning an escape. I’m supposed to take that sly rogue with me in exchange for the key. Perhaps that’s my ticket to an early retirement… [illegible fragment]<br><br>1st Day of the Month of Blathe<br>I completed my dig, only to learn I had miscalculated and exited right into the lake! My companion had not learned to swim, it seems, and now he never will, for he sleeps the big sleep, dreaming of fish. Sadly I didn’t manage to take the key to the elven treasure from him. Took all my strength just to get back to our cell, where a pack of guards were waiting for me. They knocked out a few of my ribs and a handful of teeth, but I should heal.<br><br>11th Day of the Month of Blathe<br>Things’re good. They’ve moved me to another cell. Bars on the window saw the days when elves ran Toussaint, so I’ll loosen those rust-rotten rods this evening and then it’s into the lake. It’s a long drop, true, but that’s no worry for me. Then I’ll report back to my employer and check out that tale about a treasure. If all goes well, I’ll soon be done with escapology!

   1079676|017a0e31||A Veil hangs between the world men see and the one they cannot. This Veil blocks the dead from the view of the living, and the living from the view of the dead. Some mages can break through this Veil and communicate with the dead, or else summon them to the World of the Sun for short periods of time. This is the art known as necromancy.<br><br>The dead can also break through the Veil and enter the world of the living on their own. Yet unlike the necromancers, in doing so they are not driven by reason and will, but by a thoughtless, irrational need. This need arises from powerful emotions such as regret, longing or wrath. Very often these emotions gain their power by being invested in a material object by the dead individual while he or she still knew life. The objects most frequently so endowed? Wedding rings, favorite toys - or the instrument used for the crime which sent the returned individual to the other world in the first place.

The witcher Geralt then, in the words of Vasilly S., “made quick work of the band, not sparing a one,” said individuals not having been spared taken to include Ernest, wanted for some time in Toussaint for rape (three counts) and murder (fifteen counts).<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 25% to take into account swordplay making use of more than one weapon and immediate payment in species.
   1147983|01dc5980||In our lands - that is to say, in the fair Duchy of Toussaint - the hunting of basilisks has a long and storied tradition, one reaching back to the dawn of our present history. Attesting to this is a note written by one Xenon of Trytion, a leatherworker, in the year 1023. In it one finds mention of a commission for a corset, to be fastened from “hide of that winged serpent, called basilicus by some” (see Vedetto Fiari, <i>Manuscripts through the Ages</i>, 1278). While lesser hides could come from beasts felled by age or hunger, the costliness and expanse of this corset would have necessitated the skin of a basilisk taken in its prime - and therefore required a hunt.<br><br>Without the engagement of a witcher, or, as a last resort, a knight or a mercenary, such a hunt would have perforce meant the gruesome death of the foolhardy hunter.<br><br>Yet those adept at the task - witchers chief among them - hunted basilisks and their cousins, cockatrices, with great success, thinning their numbers till a mere handful remained.<br><br>To give but one example, in the year 1100 basilisks of the <i>regulus platinum</i> subspecies dotted skies all across our land, yet in the present day only one exemplar still lives.

   1075862|02685eb4||Alexander Hoe walked down the long corridor, delighted that the sounds of debauchery pouring out of the rooms drowned out the sound of his footsteps. The long-neglected brothel floor creaked and moaned, as though the wood regretted being witness to the lecherous scenes fed to it by this house of ill-repute standing in the very center of the pride of the Northern cities. Hoe had been generously remunerated for this visit by the wife of a silk merchant. She had long suspected her husband of dabbling with loose women during his working hours. The case had seemed simple enough, banal, even. A cheating husband. How many similar affairs had he unraveled?<br><br>The worst was that his employers never truly wanted him to bring irrefutable proof of their husbands' guilt. On the contrary, in their heart of hearts they always hoped his investigations would prove their husbands model citizens, and their suspicions wholly unfounded. This time, it truly did turn out that the woman's husband was no whoremonger, despite the fact that his trail led Alexander to a place in which fleshly pleasures were bought and sold.<br><br>The door in front of which he stopped, following the instructions he had received from the gnome at the entrance, had a small plaque with the number sixteen on it. Unlike the other rooms, this one was enveloped in an unsettling calm. Hoe turned the door knob and pushed the door open - and what he saw behind it far exceeded his worst expectations…

Should white wine be one's beverage of choice, I wholeheartedly recommend the excellent offerings of two fiercely competing vineyards, Coronata and Vermentino. If one seeks Beauclair White, popular in the North, one should seek out the Castel Toricella vineyard, which produces and exports it. Unfortunately, a severe economic crisis led to the bankruptcy of several distinguished vineyards such as Corvo Bianco, known as Gwyn Cerbin in the Elder Speech (oh, their supreme Sepremento…!) and Tufo. Let us hope each and every one of them finds a passionate new owner who will restore them to their former glory…

Sadly, the rakish lifestyle of one of its owners, the last member of the Bolius line, drove the possession into ruin. The next owner, Baron Rossell, tried to return the vineyard to its former glory, but to no avail. Corvo Bianco was then auctioned off and eventually passed under the control of the Ducal Treasury.

And we know about your weakness for a woman called Rhenawedd. We have news for you: Rhenawedd is alive and well. At the moment. How long this lasts is entirely up to you.<br><br>Rhenawedd has everything she needs - even Koviri pears, for which, as you know, she has a particular liking. All this, however, may change soon. If you do not meet our demands, Rhenawedd may soon be missing not only pears, but bread and water also. We will lock her away in a rat-infested dungeon and start to torture her: first, we will pull out her fingernails, then we will break her bones, and finally we will strip her skin off, piece by piece.<br><br>You, however, can save her. All you have to do is go to Beauclair and kill five people in a specific way. Five unimportant souls for the woman you love. <br><br>You will shortly receive a letter with the first name and instructions. You have three days to perform the killing. If you do not succeed, instead of the next letter you will receive a finger of your beloved.<br><br>Don't try to look for us - you won't find us.<br><br>Your friends

   1205856|044c4cb9||This vineyard’s former owner racked up significant debts with a loan shark, who then sold them to bandits for collection. When they found he had no coin to collect, they murdered him alongside all other residents of his estate. As if that were not heinous enough, they then made the vineyard their base, from which they would hijack transports of wine to fuel their drunken orgies. So fierce and well-stocked were they, none could chase them off - until one brave alchemist spiced a transport crossing their territory with a powerful extract of ricin.

   1198802|051fb384||The most important aspect of raising human livestock is to provide the herd with conditions that, on the one hand, guarantee their survival, but, on the other hand, do not extend too far beyond the minimum needed for that survival. It should be borne in mind that people are creatures bestowed with great intelligence, or rather cunning and instincts that allow them to gain as much as possible from their environment. In terms of husbandry, this means humans will always try to obtain more than we give them. It is recommended, therefore, to provide each individual with a place to sleep, a meal twice a day and permanent access to water. These conditions, which might seem overly luxurious to some, ensure the optimal production of high quality hemoglobin (more details on diet in later chapters). Also essential is access to air, without which humans die within minutes.<br><br>There is no need to be concerned about the ability for human livestock to multiply in the conditions described above. If they are ensured a minimal existence and male and females are mixed, they will copulate irrespective of whether they are in captivity or not.<br><br>It is worth mentioning here that there is a school of thought that suggests treating human livestock with greater freedom and care, including providing them with better quality fodder and a certain degree of freedom. This allegedly ensures a greater amount of favorable elements in the blood and makes it tastier, however, it is worth mentioning that this method of husbandry is much more difficult and requires emotional bonding techniques, which will be discussed in the following chapters.

    469954|06b28b45||Among the many faiths of the Nordlings, the most widespread is the cult of Melitele, a goddess who takes three forms: young girl, mature woman and old crone. Melitele is a Mother Goddess who cares for her children. Primarily women pray to her, though men in need might also utter supplications. The religion is a vestige of the old matriarchy and testifies to the weakness of the Nordlings - people who worship female deities are soft-hearted and incapable of preparing their sons for war.<br><br>In recent years, the cult of Melitele has found a rival in the cult of the Eternal Fire, which came out of Novigrad. Clerics of the Eternal Fire demonstrate fanaticism and almost complete devotion. The religion is hostile toward any form of otherness, including nonhumans. The Order of the Flaming Rose is the cult's military arm.<br><br><br><br>The treatise also examines other faiths, including the cult of the Lionhead Spider.

Though they maintain a facade of independence and altruism, the knights errant of Toussaint of our day are paid, and by the Duchess herself! So I ask – is that noble? Is that dignified?! Should a knight, a nobleman after all, receive payment for his heroic deeds?! Is he but a mercenary or, pardon my Nazairi, a ploughing witcher? Shouldn’t the tears of joy of a rescued damsel suffice as a reward? I simply cannot understand it! To paraphrase the weighty words of the wise Renè de Hospitalier – such fools, these Toussaintois.

Instead of the arachnocide he requested, I gave him a bottle of arachnomorph pheromones. Won’t he be in for a surprise. But do the peasants not say “spiders and snakes a happy home make”? I’m sure I've heard them say something of the sort.<br><br>Our funds are nearly exhausted. I shall be forced to take something from the rainy day stash I hid from Hubert in the top floor of the tower. The bulk of our outflow goes towards the purchase of pork, which the harpies devour in gargantuan quantities. Perhaps if we were to dress one up in Redanian armor now and present it at court, the king himself would become our patron?<br><br>No, no, no! The entire squadron must be present, else Radovid will deem the whole undertaking a farce!<br><br>It seems our harpies have grown tired of pork. I found the scraps of Hubert’s overalls in one of their cages. No great loss. Hubert had already lost 8 fingers feeding them. Couldn't even grip a broom.<br><br>Catastrophe has struck! Someone opened all the cages and let out the harpies! I’m sure I’ll find them wheezing their last in the grass outside the tower – after all, no one has fed them for a week…

This is the only way to heal our isles.<br>If Skellige is to survive, it has to change. And for that we need a strong leader and an end to the eternal quarreling between the jarls. The only way that will happen is if someone shakes our countrymen, and hard, so that they wake from their slumber of foolish and destructive traditions. The feast at Kaer Trolde is our chance to deliver this shake.<br>Convince the Vildkaarls to ride to an Craite's castle, but don't tell them what fate has in store for them. No doubt many of their number would see the justice of our cause and willingly give their lives for Skellige – but the fewer who know about our plan, the better. We can't risk someone warning Crach. Let them be unwitting tools with which we will forge a better future for out isle.<br>Do as I ask, and my gratitude will know no limits. You will sit by my throne as my advisor. I will expel Ermion from the Druids' Circle and make you hierophant. I will drive off Freya's priestesses and make you lord of their temple and land.<br>I'm counting on you. Glory to Skellige,<br>The Future King

Everything was examined, my funds counted to the last copper. Zuëzan loaded everything on to a wagon and prepared the horses.

Introduced himself as a biologist. Fellow made a bad impression on me from the start. Short, thin, with a hunched back. Spectacles thick as wine bottles perched on his nose. Had to grin and bear it, though, for he was willing to pay generously (and in species) to rent the tower, first three months delivered in advance. The owner agreed, so what could I do? But I was curious about this "biologist" and wanted to learn what he wanted a whole tower for. He was cagey at first, then let slip, giddy with excitement, that he planned to rear harpies. “You don't rear harpies!” I cried, but he retorted that he'd soon change that and his tamed, tower-bred harpies would prove their use in warfare. Sure, I can see it already: winged vermin donning the Redanian red, flying off all in a row… I swear, if I've ever heard a bigger load of rubbish, my name ain't Rohn Drump!<br><br>[A few pages have been ripped out and… pecked?]<br><br>Vogel's late with the rent.

The learned gent's here, though. Thing is, he's dead.

The stank of death's unbearably strong, fills the whole tower. Don't give a rat’s arse anymore about the rent he owes. I’m getting the blazes out of here before something gets me, too…

   1224817|0a7169ac||My Dear Friend,<br><br>If you're reading this, it means you've found the chest I mentioned in my previous letter. You'll be pleased to know its contents belong to you.<br><br>After I spoke with the emperor regarding additional resources to aid in your quest, he was willing to part with these items from his personal collection. The armor from Dol Blathanna is a rare piece that marries the strengths of Nilfgaardian and elven craftsmanship. Apparently, Francesca accepted Emhyr's offer of Nilfgaardian plate for her forces. Though, despite his attempt to significantly bolster an ally on the fringes of the Northern Realms, only a portion of his aid ever reached its destination. To no one's great surprise, the elves were unimpressed with what human steel they did receive and thus refashioned the armor to their liking. You'll finally have the opportunity to masquerade as the Queen of Dol Blathanna's personal guard. It's a dream I know you speak of often.<br><br>As for the second set of armor, the emperor proved far more cryptic. He claims they were diplomatic gifts from distant kingdoms. The tiger armor is specifically designed to suit a western ruler – obviously Emhyr in this case. It was forged in the ancient style of a blacksmith who stole the secrets of its construction from their gods... Or so the legend goes.<br><br> And finally, the swords (to my eye they resemble a Redanian saber, though I'm no expert). These blades supposedly once belonged to a hero of myth and mystery. The man forged a pact with a vixen spirit and, through her blessing, was granted the ability to slay the monsters that had long plagued his village. As you can see, he carried both a steel and silver sword – a fact I thought might pique your interest.<br><br>Unfortunately, legends are all I can offer. Emhyr was stingy with the details – even more so than usual. It's a shame because I must admit I haven't the faintest idea where they might originate. That being said, I do believe Zerrikania and Ofier can be ruled out.<br><br>Dear friend, I trust you appreciate my efforts to help. Use these gifts as you see fit. I hope they will hasten your search for that which we have lost.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer

He says I’m not to fraternize with the help. But what makes him truly furious is when I converse with Yan and Fred. He claims a well-born lady should not mix with men of lower rank. That doing so undermines his rightful authority over them. Perhaps once the summer swelter begins to fade he’ll become more tolerable.<br><br>The 20th of Feainn<br><br>The boredom weighs heavier and heavier upon me.

   1185219|0e4ecd61||Dear Bartolomé,<br><br>I have received your letter and am delighted you have found a solution to your problems. The witcher you described does indeed seem dangerous – and you yourself always told me they are all freaks and cold-hearted murderers.<br><br>Yet despite all that, I still think you should agree to his offer. If those diagrams truly do outline revolutionary new methods in armor smithing, not only will you be able to complete the contract Her Grace has given you, but you will also earn a great deal of glory for yourself. And that, I know, is what you value above all else.<br><br>Going to the bandits who dwell in the ruins of Arthach Palace for protection is a wise move. If the knights could not get the best of them, a witcher will also feel duly cowed in their presence. Shady miscreants of all types always respect each other. Still, be extra careful during that meeting. Bandits and witchers are not to be trusted.<br><br>Yours Truly,<br>Belinda de Launay

Perhaps one day a bard shall happen upon it and compose from it a ballad to squeeze tears from the most pitiless miser.<br><br>Some time ago I spied a monster roaming in proximity to my estate. Upon further investigation, I learned it was a she-troll, descended from the Gorgon Foothills. I thus scraped together a few crowns and went to the camerlengo, to request he hire a knight errant to slay the monstrosity. Yet as I was making this journey, said she-troll sprang out of the bushes, knelt down by my horse and professed something in the garbled speech of trolls that I took to mean she had chosen me as her beau. Since it is most ill-bred to be rude to a lady, even a monstrous one, I declined her politely and was ready to be on my way when she tossed a sack over me, tucked me under her arm and carried me here, to this clearing. She locked me in a cage and stared at me for hours, sending creeping shivers down my spine… So now I slowly starve to death, for while she gives me clear water to drink, my only food is the soup that she-troll spends all day brewing, a foul concoction reeking of carrion and onion. I would rather perish than put that slurry to my lips…

   1205767|0ecfc544||Ding my dong, today we drink to the last drop – or till we drop! Fourfingers had us pitch camp near Delenfer Pass, and to keep from going daffy with boredom we set out on a little reconnaissance mission and happened across a merchant caravan. Sadly, we got a bit carried away – instead of gagging and hog-tying them, the lads sharpened some stakes and stuck the fat feckers on them. That was terribly exhausting work, but we had good fun doing it, and no cleft kisser can take that away. There was one skinny snipe amongst them, but we left him for later. What matters is, their wagons were packed full of quality wine just begging to be guzzled!<br><br>Naturally we established watches, so not everyone would get shloshed at once, as is only common sense. My fool of a papa used to say: Sonny, the most important thing in life’s to like your job. Do that, you’ll be happy. That feeble pate was a carpenter. No tart-twiddling idea what he liked about smacking at wood, but bumbotch him anyways. Geezer’s been pushing daisies for ages now. And if he were alive, I’d write him a letter like this: Papa, I like my work. A whole lot. And thanks for teaching me to read and write, because now I can let you know I give absolutely zero fecks about your advice.

   1080376|0fa15878||A frail ribbon flickers across the sky, the Riders' spectral silhouettes barely discernible within it. Then the cavalcade contorts closer and closer, revealing more and more of their ghastly form. Now the buffalo horns atop their helms penetrate one's view, now the crest betwixt them, and now the skull-like face exposed beneath their visors. The Riders sit astride skeletal mounts, bits of barding stuck to their sides like boils. A furious gale howls through the willows. Their blades now glisten like unfailing stars in the black sky. The wind howls louder and louder. No. That is no wind. That is ghoulsong. Suddenly the nightmarish cavalcade twists once more, the hooves of its ghostly mounts churning the light of will o' the wisps hanging above the bog.<br><br>At the head of the cavalcade rides the King of the Hunt. A rust-eaten bascinet sways above a skull-like mask. Gaping eye sockets burn with a pale blue fire. Around him whirls a tattered cloak. A necklace rattles atop his rust-covered breastplate. Holes empty as the abyss stare out from it - once they were filled with precious stones, but these fell out during his race across the skies and became stars. The King of the Hunt laughs, his teeth, rotten as the grave, snapping above the rusted collar of his breastplate. The blue flames in the eye sockets of his skeletal mask roar.

Besides, sometimes someone shows who doesn’t like our profession, or who tries to cheat us.

He can do all sorts of tricks - sit, roll over, and if you give him a scrap of bacon, he'll even shake your hand. But today, why, he's outdone himself today.<br><br>I look, and there's Musky, running in from the field carrying something in his mouth. I think, "Maybe it's a hare, and I'll be able to whip up a stew, sell the fur?" But no, it was a sack. All covered in blood, so no wonder he sniffed it out. I look inside... and inside there's a key. A little one, all engraved and ornamented, like it fits some fancy chest or box. So I think, "Maybe there's treasure hidden hereabouts, and that's what this key's for?" So I think I'll go for a walk, see what I can see. If I find it, I swear to Melitele, Musky's going to eat nothing but veal for the rest of his days!<br><br>That blood on the sack's got me a bit worried, though... But I'll take a thick club with me, so if anything pops out of the bushes, it'll get a thumping. You don't live but once, so you might as well take some risks, I always say!

They possess a will of their own and are intelligent, though not in the way of men. For there is no way to fathom their drives and intentions.<br><br>Genies, the most powerful of the elemental spirits, prove the most difficult for men to commune with. Only the true masters of magic have perfected this art, which demands long years of study and risky experiments. Yet even the most adept at the magic arts cannot tame a genie, merely force it to perform certain acts against its own volition.<br><br>They say the mage Stammelford once commanded a d’ao to move a mountain blocking the view from his tower, but even he could never convince a genie to be a willing helpmate in his work or to give sound advice, for the reasoning of these creatures is beyond human understanding.

The "miraculous hair-growing formula" he sells is nothing more than well water from the Bits dyed with a modicum of lilac extract. The only effect imbibing this concoction is likely to bring about is a debilitating case of diarrhea which will keep you running to the outhouse day and night - a fact which I had the dubious pleasure of learning through first-hand experience. Therefore, if this shameless cheat should pay a visit to your domicile, buy nothing and instead tell him to go suck down his own remedy.<br><br>–- Volker Ollinger

   1062862|12e55f34||Your Most Honored Grace, the Duchess of Arcsea!<br><br>[illegible fragment]… The witcher Gerd feared Your Grace’s wrath, feared Your Grace’s righteous fury, so off he fled to Skellige, to that hive of pirates, thieves and other such bandits. In sooth, the gods must have smiled on our quest, for quickly did we catch his foul scent and track him to a public house near the village of Fyresdal, where he was banqueting with the locals. Some sought to protect him, treating the traitorous man as a companion in arms. We therefore showed them no mercy and burned the inn to the ground. Alas and alack, the witcher escaped us once again, but we tracked him to the ruins of the old fortress called Etnir, where he went to hide or else perchance lay in wait by some monster... [illegible]<br><br>We made haste to assault his position with all our strength, but still the treacherous foe slew five of my men, wounded me most severely and brought the ruins' roof collapsing down on us with some witchcraft. Never fear, we shall surely free ourselves from here soon. Meanwhile I have ordered the vile witcher's campsite searched and have found a diagram for some highly curious weapon. It is enclosed with this writing, entrusted to Your Grace's safekeeping. Another day, perhaps two, and we shall dig ourselves out of this rubble and catch the witcher. If fate is kind, perhaps I shall next send Your Grace not a missive, but the witcher's scalp... [illegible]<br><br>...yet it must be said that from the very start he slighted Your Grace with his most rude and brusque manners, though it is beyond the reasoning of a simple knight such as I to comprehend how a base worm like that could dare refuse Your Duchessness anything! Why, serving Your Most Graciousness is an honor, and anyone who shuns such service reveals himself as a simpleton and a knave. Thank all the heavens the gods watch over Your Graceful Being, and the merciless usurper, that twisted wretch who deems himself your father, could be ripped off his stolen throne without the need for that mutant’s help. Yet it is a witcher’s swiving employ, Your Grace, if you will pardon my Temerian, to kill monsters, and Your Good Grace’s father, why, what was he, if not a beast, a murderous monster lapping up the blood of innocents? And since he was such a monster - though draped in human skin, revealing his monstrous form only through deeds and not demeanor - the witcher ought to have killed him, as Your Grace asked of him. Therefore, it is just that said freak shall pay with his neck for violating the dictates of honor and witcher law alike.<br><br>Your Grace’s humble servant <br> Chalimir of Black Frydland, of the Brant banner

It was certainly out of concern for Her Enlightened Grace and her little realm that the emperor founded an embassy in Toussaint, consisting of a handful of dignitaries who dwell in the duchy full-time and use their experience to help with her, de facto enlightened, decisions.

Problem is, I’ve no beau of my own to take to her wedding. If any intelligent, amusing, handsome, none too old nor none too young man, owning at least one decent looking frock or robe, is interested in accompanying me to her wedding ceremony and the feast to follow, I’d be most thoroughly obliged. In exchange, I can offer a few hours of good fun and good conversation with a lass that dances with the best of them. Alcohol will also be provided.<br><br>–A Bashful Anonymous Beseeching an Escort<br><br>P.S. If you’re counting on taking me straight from the feast to the alcove, be warned I’m a graduate of the Ladies’ Self-Defense Courses put on by the Redanian Army. But make a good impression, and I might agree to let you court me properly.

   1062863|149a37d3||...that was right before dusk. Then a witcher showed, dirty and unshaven and stinking worse than a fisherman from Faroe. Asked for a room and a bucket of water so's he could freshen up some. First I didn't want to let him in, on account of the bloody sack he was carrying, but then it came out he had arranged to meet Jorgen Iron Hand here - and a friend of Jorgen's a friend of mine...[illegible]<br><br>Sun had long set by the time Jorgen showed. Witcher handed him that sack and we all learned why it stank so bad - inside was the head of a siren. Jorgen had contracted the witcher to take it down after it attacked some folk in a cave in the northwestern part of Spikeroog. Seeing it dead cheered folk awful fast, and Jorgen, happy as a clam, started buying everybody rounds. The witcher refrained at first, saying he was off to take care of a striga that'd infested the ruins of a fortress on the northern edge of the isle, but in the end he gave in - after all, there's no refusing Jorgen...[illegible] <br><br>...made a lovely heap of coin that day, for the sun started rising and not a man had gone home. The witcher got drunk with Jorgen and started telling us tales, then we sat down for some gwent. That Gerd, he might be a first-class warrior, but he's one lousy card player. Lost half his reward for that siren to me (and drank the other half), then, wanting to win it back, he wagered a diagram for some kind of steel sword. To my eye it was a scrap of rubbish, but fuck it, some things you gotta do for the sake of sportsmanship and camaraderie, so I accepted the wager...[illegible].

Summer was short, and fall's just started and already we've had the first frosts. Got men digging in hardened ground. They plant millet or barley, but they won't harvest much of either. Panic's setting in on Undvik. "Winter's coming," or so say the old timers huddled around their fires. Everyone avoids saying "Ragh nar Roog," as if the words themselves could bring disaster. But everyone senses the last battle's leaping ever closer towards us. To my mind, long as the giants still sleep, we've hope yet. Aye.... we've hope yet...

   1062874|1803e911||My dearest Ingerborga,<br><br>[illegible fragment] … arrived at Fort Tuirseach on summer’s first day. He tarried there a while, draining more than one barrel of mead with the jarl. Soon both were fast friends. Then one day Jarl Torgeir summoned me and ordered me to sail to Spikeroog with him, to show him to where the sirens were the thickest.<br><br>It’s no exaggeration, my little mountain goat, to say I’ve never met a warrior like him in my life. He’s lithe as an eel and strong as a bear! When the sirens came at us, I hadn’t even time to seize my axe before he’d gutted them all. And his weapon, why, I’ve never seen its like – a crossbow, but so small he wields it with one hand. I know he has a sketch of it in his saddlebags, for I spied it when he was packing up. Once he's asleep, I'll try to sketch a copy to take to our smith on An Skellig, so he can make others. So we can protect ourselves from the sirens, case they return. <br><br>[illegible fragment]… soon as dawn breaks, we’re off, sirens are swarming thicker and thicker, my hands are numb from so much sword-swinging and my breath’s ragged, but thinking of you gives me strength… [rest of letter illegible]

During the after-hunt feast Crach announced he wanted to patch things up between Clans an Craite and Tordarroch.

   1205922|195d1339||This line's founder, Stefan de Coronata, once asked a druid to help him be rid of the caterpillars devouring his vines. The druid suggested he raise martens, which love to feed on that insect's larvae. Stefan duly took the druid’s advice and soon eradicated the plague not only in his own vineyard, but in all the neighboring ones as well. In return for this bounteous deed, he was awarded a noble title. He chose a blue wolf to adorn his crest, after deciding he would look foolish parading about with a marten on his shield.

The moral of the tale is held to be that nothing good ever comes from Nazair, and that when one has a young wife, one should stay at home instead of gallivanting about on campaigns.

He admitted he had wasted his gods-given time on pleasures of the flesh and all that he had to show for it were chains and indignities. I tried to lift his spirits, to tell him there is another Path, that he can cast off his past habits and devote his life to Lebioda and His teachings.

Next a scouting patrol, five warriors strong, disappeared right around there. Jarl Tordarroch sent his strongest men out to look for them. And they never returned either. They say it's all the fault of Tor Gvalch'ca. And I think they might be right.

Exact revenge on the men who did you wrong after my death. Make me proud.<br><br>I never told you this, but I've always felt it: I love you, Janne. I hope one day we'll meet in the halls of Freya's eternal green garden and you'll tell me about your life. The life I was not able to see.<br><br>You have my blessings, son.
   1082432|1a6be9d8||According to legend, many years ago a young woman would wait here and watch for her husband's return from an overseas raid. Years passed and woman grew old, still waiting for her husband. Yet he never came, and finally, she died. Three days after her funeral, her husband returned, having at last escaped from the pirates who had held him captive all this time. When he learned about his beloved's loyal vigil, he wept bitter tears, then leapt to his death.

The effects of such exertion at your age can indeed prove most detrimental.<br><br>I've come upon some information which might be of interest to you. While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery. Yet his journal should at least provide hints as to both. It is said he was laid to rest with it in his tomb.<br><br>I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.<br><br>Should you grow tired of sampling Beauclair's ladies, wines and other exquisite delicacies, this matter might prove a fruitful diversion. Investigate at your leisure.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer.

"We only send the best of the best to Deadwight Wood” – those were his words. I’m damned proud. Strange enough, there ain’t many trees around and not a corpse to be seen. Maybe the Master’s information was out of date and the peasants have felled the whole wood. Thomas says it’s because we went the wrong way, but he can’t read nor write, so I’m not about to trust him.

   1075844|1afbad4e||Jarl Bodvar took the lovely Fridebjorg for his wife. They lived many long years together - but when Bodvar's hair turned gray and his skin became covered with wrinkles, Fridebjorg still looked the same she did the day they got married. Only her eyes, which were black as coal, revealed her true age.<br><br>At first everyone took Friedbjorg's ageless beauty to be a sign of the goddess Freya's favor. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. One day Jarl Bodvar returned early from a raid and discovered his wife had been kidnapping and murdering young girls, then bathing in their blood. The blood of the innocent maids washed away all signs of aging, changing when it touched her body into a thick, black fluid that smelled like rotting innards. When the jarl saw all those girls hanging from their legs, their throats slit, he flew into a rage and set fire to the castle. He stayed inside as he was burned alive - along with his cruel wife, all his retinue and his servants. But to this day you can still hear cries coming from the castle's ruins - as if Fridebjorg had never stopped her murders...

From this it clearly follows that the witcher is, in the very matter of his being, a defiler of nature, an immoral and loathsome degenerate, born from the darkest and rankest depths of hell, for only one such as the devil himself can derive pleasure from suffering and torment.<br><br>[note in margin]<br><br>The book is a key.

Many centuries later, the village of Lofoten was founded here to take advantage of this convenient harbor.

That’s why I gathered up the worst of my lot, the ones who don’t do a lick of good to make up for the cost of feeding them, and sent them to a certain death. I know, I hear you asking: is it a dolt’s fault he’s a dolt? Well, these cretins could prove a serious threat to us in battle.

   1061817|1c8e5a49||No one can claim to have traveled the Northern Realms who has not been to Novigrad. If I were forced to list what during my many meanderings has made the greatest impression on me, it would be precisely this great, and yet at the same time free, city.<br><br>A metropolis worthy of the Empire, its only flaw is that the civilization Nilfgaard carries within her has not yet enlightened it. That is why hordes of reactionary cultists of the Eternal Fire dwell in the midst of its excellent buildings and superb commercial infrastructure. One feels as though superstition is how the local Hierarch and his temple guard cement their power over the city dwellers. And many they are to control, for the city counts no less than thirty thousands of inhabitants.<br><br>While strolling through its fabulous port, surrounded by marvels of architecture, it is hard to imagine that centuries ago Novigrad was a mere minor elven townstead. When the city fell into the hands of the Nordlings, its problems grew exponentially, for as is well known the people of the North can do a great many things, but peaceful and orderly cohabitation is not one of them. And so Novigrad first belonged to Redania, and then fell under Temerian rule, until finally, after endless compromises and bargains, it at last became a Free City.<br><br>But is the city truly free? I dare to doubt it. Redanian influence makes itself felt too strongly on every street corner, and the fact that the city is located within Radovid’s territory speaks for itself...<br><br>While wandering the city’s streets I came across four water mills, eight banks and nearly nineteen pawn shops. There are also a great many houses of simple pleasures such as taverns and brothels, and Novigrad’s commitment to matters of faith is borne witness to by the fact that the city contains no less than - I kid you not - nineteen temples to the Eternal Fire!<br><br>What more can be said… I think Novigrad has all the makings of the capital of the world, and perhaps that is what it will one day become. First, however, someone needs to bring order to within her walls.

   1057890|1cf2f71a||Legend states that when Otkell, son of Hemdall, was sailing to Hindarsfjall, a terrible storm broke. Otkell called for his father’s help, but his father could not hear, for powerful thunder drowned out Otkell's voice. In despair Otkell began yelling for anyone who heard his cries to come to his aid. In reply, Freya descended and gave Otkell a set of pipes.<br><br>When the hero blew on them, the waves calmed, the storm passed and Otkell could safely reach the shore. When Hemdall learned of the help the goddess had given Otkell, he ordered him to raise a temple to her on the isle. Ever since that day, Skelligers have worshipped Freya, and the women of Otkell’s line have often chosen to become her priestesses.

   1079405|1d2272ee||... and so there was much rejoicing in the castle at the appearance of an itinerant monster slayer in the person of the witcher Gerd. Jarl Torgeir, whose face in the months since the death of his battle brother, Ingmar, had worn a listless and saddened frown, came alive with renewed strength. Jarl and witcher fast found common tongue, and soon were venturing on hunts together and hosting feasts at which there was no end to laughter nor bluster... [illegible]<br><br>...then Jarl Torgeir told Gerd of the hideous striga which prowled the ruins of Etnir, desecrating that once-proud fortress, which in happier times had stood a steadfast guardian of the northern expanses of Ard Skellig. The jarl's lament moved the witcher, who announced he would slay said beast. Yet witcher Gerd was a craftsman ever diligent and true, and so explained he first had to complete a prior contract and rid a cave on Spikeroog of sirens...[illegible]<br><br>And so the jarl gave Gerd a full pouch of coin and the services of Olven, Org's son, as a guide to take him safely to Spikeroog and, if the danger grew fierce, to fight the sirens at the witcher's side. His heart filled with gratitude, Gerd entrusted an armor diagram to the jarl, one he had long carried and held most dear, as a token of his sincere intent to return as soon as he had finished his allotted task...

   1083330|1d9573bc||Ill news has come in from the south. Hambald One-Eye's expedition was ambushed in Adaria Bay, off the northwestern coast of Nilfgaard. Admiral Shirac's fleet surrounded two longships. But he took no prisoners. They all died. No one surrendered or asked for mercy. Witnesses claim it all went down in absolute silence. Only sound the clanging of weapons and whistling of arrows. Didn't even scream as they died.<br><br>I'm sure you're thinking, "If no one survived, you couldn't know all that." Aye, I can. Last week a patrol of our lads came across the Black One's ship. They couldn't attack, but at night they snuck aboard and loosened some tongues. Turned out the sailor they pushed up against the fire had taken part in the battle in the bay. Told them everything. Thanks to him the skalds will sing praises of Undvik's warriors' heroic deeds till the end of time.

   1209965|1e708c97||In the sun-drenched duchy of Toussaint, near the Coronata vineyard, lay the estate of Baronet Hubert Balaste, an honorable knight in the service of Duchess Ademarta. Hubert served as a knight errant for many years and vows were his greatest delight. He swore to do things so grand they curdled blood of other knights. The duchess finally recognized his courage and not only awarded him with an honorary title, but also granted him land. Hubert thus had a place of his own on which to settle down and wait till his time came with dignity. He could find himself a wife and sire descendants as befits every self-respecting hero.<br><br>Unfortunately, once he had lain down his sword and shield, Baronet Balaste began to seek other diversions. And so he indulged in games of card and dice – and at times even bet on dog fights. Then, one day, when fortune abandoned him, he decided to bet not one or two gold pouches, but in fact his family’s entire estate. And he lost. Everything. To add to this already unhappy state of affairs, Hubert Balaste, who was not one to take defeat lightly, flew into a fit of blind passion, donned his armor and enlisted at once. Fortune alas smiled no more favorably upon him at war than it did at play, and an arrow found its way to Hubert’s leg. Then he died of gangrene.

Due to the unique nature of the Belgaard Estate and its important role in the production of wine bringing great fame to the duchy in all corners of the world, only subjects of the Duchy of Toussaint shall be allowed to participate in the auction.<br><br>To all knights errant and other such men of arms - be it known far and wide that the services of voluntary keepers of the peace shall be needed. Minor problems are expected to arise during the transfer of the above-mentioned real estate, and said problems, for their dissolution, could require the application of direct physical force. All volunteers are asked to report to the field office of the Procurator General of Toussaint near Plegmund’s Bridge, that is to say, to the place where the auction shall be held.

Must not have wanted Clan Torrdaroch's jarl to discover the truth, because they covered their tartans with soot. Didn't expect our guard to be on the look out and for our folk to put up resistance. Four of ours died, two of theirs. Clearly Lugos has gotten bored of raiding the Continent and is looking for loot closer to home. One thing's certain: if it's war he wants, it's war he's gonna get.

The coven gathering the worst of them - the knab of those utterly depraved and swollen thick with the pus of magic - was the Lodge of Sorceresses.<br><br>The first fiends of this Lodge were Philippa Eilhart, Lady of Montecalvo, Triss Merigold of Maribor, Keira Metz of Carreras, Margarita Laux-Antille, Síle de Tansarville of Creyden, Sabrina Glevissig of Ard Carraigh, Fringilla Vigo of Beauclair, Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, elven women, Assire var Anahid and Yennefer of Vengerberg.<br><br>On the summit of Bald Mountain they gathered, witches all, to swear fealty to their devils and demons, their masters and lovers, and to promise to bring doom upon those living in peace in the Northern Realms. ‘Twas they who stood behind the murders of Demavend, King of Aedirn, Foltest, King of Temeria and many other noble men besides. ‘Twas they who brought about the outbreak of yet another war with Nilfgaard. ‘Twas they who sent plague and pox against decent, gods-fearing folk.<br><br>Yet take comfort, dear reader, for their deeds shall not go unpunished. Our gracious leader Radovid, fifth of his name, saw through their lies and swore their deaths, deaths as inevitable as they shall be painful.

   1080562|218dee11||Breaking in a horse's psyche is a simple matter of instilling your will as the rider into your mount, acquiring its trust and training its obedience. Horses are intelligent, noble beasts, so they should be treated with tenderness and a decisive and firm energy.<br><br>Mayer, the unquestioned authority in this area, emphasizes that when training one's mount a rider must eternally on the lookout for errors in the training itself. Every time the taming process ends in failure, the rider must look for the blocking error first of all in the his own actions, secondly in the horse's anatomy and only in a last resort by concluding the horse has a naturally difficult temperament.<br><br>Adhering to this principle protects one from undue punishments, which destroy the possibility of reaching an understanding between rider and mount and make it impossible to gain the animal's trust.

The kind who live according to the gods' laws, and nature's laws, too. Those disgusted by the machinations of witches, magickers and nonhumans. All that separates us from common folk is that we've the courage to take up arms, to defend our lands from evil, to slice out the gangrene that eats us from within.<br><br>We haven't a leader. We haven't forts or land. Though gods-fearing Radovid supports us with his gold at times, we've not sworn him nor any other ruler any oath. We serve only the Eternal Fire, and we listen only to our own conscience.<br><br>Who can join us? Any who is right of soul and sound of body. You can find us in every larger city in the North. We will give you board, lodging and a weapon. We will explain how to spot the tell-tale signs of evil - birthmarks in strange and arcane shapes, smooth skin on a matron aged more than thirty springs, and black cats kept in the yard, to name but a few. We will show you how to defend yourself from witchcraft, how to tame and snuff out magic elements with dimeritium. We will instruct you how to squeeze the sinners' darkest secrets out of them with a hot iron, and how to grant them cleansing death with the help of sacred fire.

I swore a hundred times that we'd split the booty from this raid as we've split the others - evenly. And I meant it. Thing is, two chests of jewels, a silver dagger and some gold cups and plates have gone missing. I summoned all from the clan who were on the raid - and all swore on the blood of their fathers, and their father's fathers before them, that they'd not taken more than their share.<br><br>That leaves Ingvar. I might have known better than to take an An Craite aboard. It were my error, but one we can correct. One you can correct. Take a handful of men and go find him. Then take from him what's ours.

And now that he's got his sanctimonious paws on Dijkstra's treasure, he can hire enough men to search every home in the city thrice over. I am a doppler, so I will be able to hide… But you, you must flee. While you still can.<br><br>Your Dudu<br><br>P.S. Don't even think about trying to break Dandelion free from Menge's clutches - it's impossible. But knowing our friend, he'll wriggle his way out somehow. Or at least I hope he will.<br><br>P.P.S.

   1210282|221312a2||Report on Knight Errantry Activities in the Duchy of Toussaint #33/g/07/ul/1271<br><br> As per Minister Tremblay’s decree numbered EK/13/w/z, each and every knight errant erring within the Duchy of Toussaint’s borders is required to offer immediate and unconditional aid to any companions in distress. By the power of said decree, each knight thus rendering aid will be rewarded according as per the following: a remuneration of the “Heron” type (in the case of aid in a battle against one human opponent) or of the “Crane” type (in the case of aid in a battle against more than one human opponent or a nonhuman opponent), to be paid from the funds of the knight receiving aid within one fiscal month.<br>Above-mentioned “Crane”-type remuneration has been awarded to the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who lent assistance to Sir Daniel Dubois. Sir Dubois was traversing the area near the lake known as Seidhe Llygad for therapeutic-recreational purposed (prescribed by a druidic healer from Caed Myrkvid) when he was attacked by 2 (in words: two) members of the criminal organization run by Graybill Pellegrin. While providing assistance, the witcher eradicated these “vandaguilders” (colloquial term for organized criminals plying the plunder trade), pursuant to Her Illustrious Grace’s Order of March 24th, 1264, on the Protection of the Borderlands.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 19% to take into account the tax on equine emissions and immediate payment in species.

The matter should be simple, for tuff is usually uninhabited, but all these grottos are either full of monstrosities or have been bought up by copper-pinching wine merchants scheming to fill every cave with their hideous barrels! Blast, I must find a cicerone, a local guide of some sort who will show me to some completely unoccupied cavern!<br><br>20 Feainn<br>A certain Luq Veunèque whom I encountered in San Sebastian has enticed me with promises of a fabulous cave ("you won’t regret it, Master Gerek!"), in which there are no greedy grape hoarders nor any monsters. Tomorrow we shall set out to the Blessure Forest, but before embarking I invited my guide to a supper at the Pheasantry – we will be spending several days together, after all, and I’d like to get to know him better. Luq turned out to be a picky gentleman. The chef de cuisine served us veal cutlets in garlic sauce and Gessenese bean soup. Luq, however, asked for pancakes and red wine, making excuses about an inborn distaste for garlic. He also didn’t touch the silver cutlery, explaining something about an allergy and making use of his own wooden set instead. Despite these oddities, he made for quite interesting company and we chatted over a bottle (bottles, to be precise) of wine until late in the night. Something tells me there will soon be much talk of the Votty Gerek - Luq Veunèque duo in the world of speleologists!

   1062471|22af4eaf||I, the undersigned George of Kagen, a witcher by trade, testify as follows.<br><br>While traveling through Velen I received a summons to provide professional testimony in the matter of the accused Bartoslav of Luvfield.<br><br>This Bartoslav stands accused of causing several shipwrecks near the lighthouse which it is his duty to keep. Ships led astray by errant signals from his lighthouse have repeatedly smashed against rocks near the shore, and the lighthouse keeper is held to be responsible for this state of affairs. During the trial Bartoslav testified that he was diligent in the fulfilment of his duties and that the accidents were caused by nightwraiths deceiving sailors with their false glow.<br><br>Having investigated the area, I can testify that I found no trace of nightwraith activity. There are likewise no signs of noonwraiths, mamunes, errnymphs or any other specters in the habit of misleading weary travelers journeying by foot, sea or horse.<br><br>I did, however, find the catastrophes’ true cause. They were not the fault of the nightwraiths blamed by the accused, but neither were they the fault of the lighthouse keeper himself. The accidents were caused by local hooligans who have taken to lighting fires on the hill at night and then robbing the ships that subsequently wreck upon the shore. I was put on their trail by Bartoslav’s son, who showed me the ashes from their misleading fires.<br><br>My testimony shows that the lighthouse keeper Bartoslav of Luvfield is not guilty of the crimes of which he stands accused and should be freed. I also humbly ask for the bailiff to put the lighthouse keeper and his family under his protection, for in light of the revelations Bartoslav’s son led me to discover, there will surely be certain parties with cause for vengeance. I cannot undertake the task of protecting the family myself, for I have accepted a contract to kill a dragon said to be lurking atop the Crookback Hills and so must return there posthaste to kill the beast and complete my task.<br><br>Signed: George of Kagen, witcher<br>Transcribed by Vicenzo Stock, marshal to the royal prefecture in Gors Velen

Who knows, maybe he ran off? I'd rather that than something worse to have happened. Truth be told, I think about leaving here more and more lately, about going back to you and the young one.

The Prince of Ellander did receive such a specimen from those far-off lands.

   1205881|242d2e4d||Experts know the secret to Toussaint wine lies not in the vines of its hills but in the oaks of its forests. So desirable are barrels made from this wood, it seemed loggers would cut the duchy clear until protests from angry druids stopped them. After years of negotiations, a compromise was reached and a special organization, the Coopers’ Guild, was created. Thanks to its strict supervision of the industry, logging became sustainable and it became the richest guild in the city – as evinced by the proud gate it funded.

   1063201|2464274e||Having heard rumors of a dragon, I raced at full speed to Velen. Sadly, I was dragged away from my hunt by the prefects of Gors Velen. They summoned me as an expert to solve the riddle of a string of shipwrecks suspected to be the work of nightwraiths. Hmph. Seems a dragon ravaging the countryside is a lower priority than blocked trade routes. Luckily I was able to solve the riddle of the lone lighthouse quickly and raced off after the dragon.<br><br>I learned that the peasants from the ravaged villages had taken shelter in the elven catacombs under Lake Wyndamer. Wise. Yet they were not wise enough to bring firewood… and so warmed themselves by burning elven manuscripts! It aches my heart to think what knowledge about the Alder Folk went up in those flames… At least a few of the manuscripts survived (including some highly interesting sketches of armor). Yet enough about that.<br><br>Eye witnesses have reported: ashen scales, height at haunches – 2 fathoms, length – 5 fathoms (addendum: estimated weight – approx. 14 quintals), able to maintain a high temperature in its bellows (dragon lungs) for longer than a quarter hour. Conclusion: we are dealing with a green dragon.<br><br>Commencing hunt.
   1057893|2469fff2||Modolf, progenitor of Clan Drummond, who was granted mastery over the isle of Undvik, unlike his brothers displayed no extraordinary abilities: he was neither wise nor especially brave, nor did he possess any particular gift which would make him a great individual. He resented Hemdall for not bestowing greater talent upon him. Hemdall, however, insisted he had blessed each of his sons with equal gifts, but not all revealed themselves at once - Modolf would have to wait for the right moment for his gifts to step forward. Yet the hero was impatient and could not wait for this moment. Instead, again and again he sought out trouble of the worst sort, hoping each time his hidden talent would shine. Hemdall grew angry with his son and decided to bury his gift even deeper. Modolf died after a long and unruly life filled with incredible adventures, but a life during which he never discovered his talent. His descendants decided to continue his search elsewhere. They abandoned Undvik and invaded Ard Skellig, eventually taking half of that isle for themselves. They now seek to take the other half, but whether doing so would finally reveal their line's unique gift - no one knows.

You'll be pleased to know its contents belong to you.<br><br>After I spoke with the emperor regarding additional resources to aid in your quest, he was willing to part with these items from his personal collection. Although he was stubbornly cryptic regarding their origins, he did mention they were diplomatic gifts from distant kingdoms. The tiger armor is specifically designed to suit a western ruler – obviously Emhyr in this case. It was forged in the ancient style of a blacksmith who stole the secrets of its construction from their gods... Or so the legend goes. The swords, to my eye, resemble a Redanian saber, though I'm no expert. These blades supposedly once belonged to a hero of myth and mystery. The man forged a pact with a vixen spirit and, through her blessing, was granted the ability to slay the monsters that had long plagued his village. As you'll notice, he carried both a steel and silver sword – a fact I thought might pique your interest.<br><br>Unfortunately, legends are all I can offer. As I said, Emhyr was stingy with the details – even more so than usual. It's a shame because I must admit I haven't the faintest idea where they might originate. That being said, I do believe Zerrikania and Ofier can safely be ruled out.<br><br>Dear friend, I trust you will appreciate my efforts to help. Use these gifts as you see fit. I hope they will hasten your search for that which we have lost.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer

Now I'm asking you to read this careful, for what I got to say's important.<br><br>Soon as you set hands on this writing, gallop off to that fence Kramer what's based in Maribor. Tell him we've got some first-class gear and witcher sword diagrams to sell. Aye, I can see you now, scratching your head, or more likely your arse, and asking, "Did I hear that right?" You sure did - 'twas my luck to come to care for a witcher what got one foot in the grave and t'other hovering right above. I was sat there looking at the poor man suffer in agony, and thought to meself, "He don't need this kit and these papers where he's going, while for us, that's the fixings we need to get us started in the world of business, if we sell them for the right price, that is." Aye, I hear you fretting, so stop. I didn't take everything, in fact, nobody'll even realize ought of his shite's missing.<br><br>Sad, though, ain't it - this witcher's a good man. First he helped the baronet solve the riddle of that lighthouse what was sending ships into the rocks, then he killed that dragon ate all the peasants. Problem is, a dragon's no easy pickings, and our valiant hero got quite the licking taking it out. He's done for, that's certain, so soon as they bury him in the tomb on Crookback Hills, I'll head straight to your place. Come to think of it, I'm curious how they'll put him in that crypt at all, for word is a vampeer's made it his lair.<br><br>P.S. I also lifted a few flasks off the witcher, but since they're like not to survive the journey, reckon I'll sample them myself, see how witcher hooch goes down - maybe we'll make a business out of that, too!<br><br> Your brother-in-law, A.

My suggestion to head deeper into the woods and look for signs of the expedition was shrugged off with a comment about my impertinence and an accusation of trying to take over leadership of the expedition.<br><br>18th Day of the Month of Blathe<br>The professor has perished. He departed yesterday morning and had not returned to camp by evening. We shall soon set out to look for him. Perhaps that drunkard finally dared visit the ruins?

    566327|2859a2ad||Dear witcher, sir (if any be present hereabouts, that is)<br><br>I've a hunch - eh, what am I saying - I'm dead certain that the woods I was lucky enough to gain possession of - or at least, I felt lucky about that till recently - that these woods are home to a cruel evil, a devil of some kind. I hired a gang of dwarven loggers not long back to harvest lumber. Strapping lads, every last one having cut down many a mighty tree in his life. So you can imagine my surprise when said loggers disappeared, all save one, and he claimed to have seen a monster. I've marked out a bounty for freeing my stretch of woods from all foul creatures, and dearly hope that soon I will have the pleasure of giving it to someone.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>-Brean Hotsch

I am trying to limit my magic communication to the absolute minimum. One never knows who's listening, don’t you agree?<br><br>I am delighted you have found a position at our gracious emperor's court and wish you the best of luck in the search for his daughter. It is good to know that Emhyr's intentions for her have become more, how shall I put it, mundane. Perhaps in these circumstances an agreement regarding the Lodge will prove possible after all?<br><br>In response to your first question, I can state beyond all doubt that Ciri has not appeared anywhere south of the Yaruga. Believe me, I could recognize her magic signature in my sleep.<br><br>I have not had any contact with Triss for a long time. I only know that things in Novigrad have taken an ill turn. She mentioned something earlier about fleeing to Kovir, but I am afraid that in the current political climate that amounts to an impossible daydream.<br><br>I hope I will soon be able to join you in Vizima. First, however, I must take care of some unfortunate yet urgent matters in Beauclair.<br><br>With my fondest regards,<br><br>Fringilla Vigo<br><br>P.S. Thank you for the news about Geralt.

Got a visit from that witcher the baronet summoned about them evil powers took over the lighthouse and were crashing ships against the rocks. He stood there in the doorway to my forge, looking noble as a prince or duke or something, and said his silver sword got damaged during his last job. Blade was chipped bad, almost broken in two spots. I asked how he expected me to know how to fix a weapon like that, and he gave me a diagram and said I was to forge him a new one, and promised quite the sum in return.<br><br> ...damn near tuckered myself out making that thing! Aye, I did my apprenticeship with Master Barnaby of Novigrad and I've made a witcher blade or two in my life, but it's been over three years since I last touched anything of the sort. In the end didn't matter, though - afore I could finish, the witcher figured out what was going on with the lighthouse and had to make haste to the baronet's castle, for... [rest illegible]

   1206896|2b5520a9||(...) In recent decades, many of us have come to believe that a much more effective way of obtaining good quality human blood than hunting individuals is their systematic, controlled husbandry. Apart from the obvious advantages, such as being able to control what the flock eats and the ability to crossbreed specific individuals to obtain offspring with the best hemoglobin, another clear advantage to breeding human flocks is that domesticated humans held in confinement, as opposed to those in their natural habitat (i.e. "villages" and "towns"), become less aggressive, and therefore less troublesome.<br><br>When it comes to farming humans, there are various schools, of which two seem to have gained the widest acceptance in recent times - namely battery-cage and free-range husbandry. This thesis describes in detail the advantages and disadvantages as well as the methods of carrying out each type of breeding. As an introduction, it is worth mentioning the basic differences between both types.<br><br>Battery-cage human husbandry (described very accurately and in detail in the book <i>Human Husbandry</i>) is the placing of several male and female individuals in a closed, restricted space, with permanent access to air, food and water. This form of breeding differs from free range in that the flock is not permitted to leave the breeding area and is held captive the entirety of their lives.<br><br>Free-range, on the other hand, involves leaving the flock in its natural habitat or creating a habitat that simulates it closely (i.e. creating villages, more on which can be found in the chapter - Human Villages: Establishing and Growing a Herd), and then making the herd psychologically or physically dependent on its owner. The most effective method for making a human individual dependent is guaranteeing it safety and permanent access to high quality feed. It is worth adding that a human that trusts its owner does not feel fear and does not defend itself when having its blood drunk, which limits the production of noradrenaline and cortisol, which have a negative impact on the taste of the blood. Furthermore, it may happen that a domesticated free-range human may feel a certain pleasure when its owner drinks its blood (most likely associated with sexual tension), which causes an intensification in the blood's flavor.

   1205845|2bada4a1||Toussaint was once a land of elves. The ducal palace is the most prominent remnant of that era, but it is not the only. The Aen Seidhe left behind a great many smaller and larger structures whose function can today only be guessed at. An example of this are the Termes Palace ruins, which some tie to the legendary resting place of the last elven king, while others consider them a temple to some forgotten deity. What they were in truth, we shall never know.

The mushroom-like expansion of San Sebastian and the Port District forced Beauclair's residents to knock through an additional passageway to facilitate the circulation of traffic between the capital’s districts. Some even called for the walls to be torn down altogether – for what had they to fear, with their town protected by the bravest knights errant the world has ever known?

   1202087|2ed855e9||Dear Hadewiga,<br><br>You were absolutely correct to advise against this journey. Why did the Dean of Archeology entrust its leadership to the hands of this quadroon? Who found the Violet Ruby of Aed Gynvael, me or her?<br><br>You must know the witcher has returned after all! The Ruby removed the barrier (as I held it would from the start!) and allowed him to explore the interior. Can you believe the witcher almost convinced that Duchamp to return to town to hire additional guards?! “We don’t know what dangers are in store for us.” Now there’s someone who knows how to pad his billable hours! Duchamp took to the idea, recalling the tale about the tomb being cursed. Yet I convinced the company not to put any stock in fairy tales. We must hurry, I said, for what if someone beats us to it and robs the elven treasury first? Because as you know, according to my translation the “most precious” can only mean one thing – the lost treasure of King Divethaf! Soon it shall be ours! (blood stains)<br><br>(later addendum partly obscured by blood stains)<br>The witcher was right. We should never have gone in there. That is an accursed place! I barely managed to escape, crawl out and take the Ruby. The portal has closed. I am safe, but the others… <br><br>

As per our earlier correspondence, I would like to commission from you a geological survey to use in determining in which location we shall find the most fitting soil for expanding our vineyard’s acreage. I suspect my messenger has already given you your retainer. As a final matter, I’d like to warn you against putting too much faith in the rumors which various beggars and vagrants have been spreading through our community in the last weeks – we in this area do not have any problems with giant centipedes or monsters of any sort, and you may begin your work at once with no need to fear.<br><br>I wish you success and eagerly await the results of your survey.<br>Count Vladimir Crespi

This is the only way to heal our isles.<br><br>If Skellige is to survive, it has to change. And for that we need a strong leader and an end to the eternal quarreling between the jarls. The only way that will happen is if someone shakes our countrymen, and hard, so that they wake from their slumber of foolish and destructive traditions. The feast at Kaer Trolde is our chance to deliver this shake.<br><br>Convince the Vildkaarls to ride to an Craite's castle, but don't tell them what fate has in store for them. No doubt many of their number would see the justice of our cause and willingly give their lives for Skellige – but the fewer who know about our plan, the better. We can't risk someone warning Crach. Let them be unwitting tools with which we will forge a better future for out isle.<br><br>Do as I ask, and my gratitude will know no limits. You will sit by my throne as my advisor. I will expel Ermion from the Druids' Circle and make you hierophant. I will drive off Freya's priestesses and make you lord of their temple and land.<br><br>I'm counting on you. For Skellige's sake.

The mind of man cannot comprehend this land, where non-geometric space and blasphemous colors fly in the face of everything our eyes are accustomed to. In that instant, in the moment of my arrival, I teetered on the verge of madness. I shouted a noiseless cry and sweat bloody sweat when two suns rose above my head. I fell to my knees and prayed to Zhothaqquah not for salvation, but for a quick death.<br><br>And then They came…
   1087427|2fea3fab||An Skellig is a weary travelers paradise. Those seeking respite from the hustle and bustle of urban life need look no further. Those yearning for peace, quiet and transcendental views - the kind that leave one short of breath and renewed in spirit - will find satiation on this isle. Here one may enjoy long walks along the most charming beaches in the isles, ones whose beauty far outshines that of the decidedly overrated coasts of Kovir.<br><br>Yet the true jewel of An Skellig is its port, which is famed for its skilled craftsmen, considered by many to be the best in the isles. An Skellig's shipbuilders have passed down the secrets of their trade from generation to generation for centuries, perfecting it into something which can proudly and with no exaggeration be called an art. Naturally, as a result one must wait twice as long for a vessel ordered from the local shipwrights than when ordering from lesser workmen.<br><br>Lastly, it would be a crime to discuss An Skellig without mentioning the superb (and surprisingly sophisticated!) local cuisine. Its specialty: sturgeon roasted to golden perfection in a sea-salt crust and served with carrot shavings and a sprinkling of mint. Sadly, this dish, once a mainstay of every tavern and seaside fish-fry, now has become a rarity due to the overfishing that caused a dramatic decline in the population of that most delicious of fish.

   1061875|3123eb57||(…) Which brings us to the epithet of the current ruler of Redania - “the Stern.” Allow me to diagnose the causes and consequences of this appellation.<br><br>Firstly, the seeds of Radovid’s Sternness were surely planted in his childhood. When Radovid was born to King Vizimir and Queen Hedwig in 1255, his care was immediately entrusted to Philippa Eilhart, the court sorceress. While none dared question if she was fit for the role of tutor, few now envisage her as having been a warm caregiver to a young child - and whatever harsh lessons she gave Radovid clearly left a lasting mark.<br><br>The next step on Radovid’s path to becoming the Stern? The death of his father when Radovid was but 13 years of age. Though rumor has it father and son barely knew one another, the mere fact of being thrust into one’s inheritance at such an early age and in such murky circumstances must have had a hardening effect.<br><br>Finally, the regency finished schooling Radovid towards becoming the Stern. Led by Sigismund Dijkstra of Tretogor, the Regency Council imparted upon Radovid a style of politics seeped in Dijkstra's aggressive, no-holds-barred, reason-of-state-first principles.<br><br>Such are the causes of Radovid’s temperament - now on to the consequences. Most manifestations of his fierce manner are well known, however, a few illustrative examples might prove useful here. They include his summoning of the Order of the Flaming Rose to be his armed enforcers, his later support for the witch hunters in their zealous cause, and finally, there is the massacre at Loc Muinne…<br><br>Yet it is in the fight against Nilfgaard that Radovid has proven himself truly the Stern. While the forces of other realms disintegrated in the face of the empire’s onslaught, he has strengthened his own realm and taken command of the joint armies of the North. Whatever their opinion of him before, all clear-eyed observers now agree: Radovid V, known also as Radovid the Stern, is the North’s last bulwark against Emhyr’s expanding power.
   1080885|3127d709||To Folk Far and Wide, <br> I've told you all plenty of times but never put it in writing, as I'm doing now, so that none may hide behind a defense of ignorance. My boy Pomir's sworn to the great mother Melitele that he'll never touch beer nor spirit again for as long as he lives. And it's a good thing he has, for when he lost our goat, hens, butter churn and the very breeches he was wearing in a game of cards two weeks back, I was mighty tempted to toss him out on his bare arse, or at least give it a thorough hiding. So if anyone spies Pomir walking towards a tavern, come see me at once, and you'll get a Novigrad crown for your trouble. Likewise, if I see any man encouraging him to drink, offering him a pint or a snifter of anything, then that scoundrel will learn that a hoe fit for more than just ploughing.<br><br>–Lillimira

As mentioned above, when the leaves of this herb are placed against the flesh, they heal all kinds of trauma, wounds and sores. Brew it, and the resulting tincture treats the common cold, colic and loss of appetite. Yet in addition to their healing properties, the branches of the yarrow plant can be used for fortune telling. This method of divination might seem strange upon first glance, but is in truth simple and effective. It truly allows one to focus on the query at hand and gain an answer both accurate and satisfying.

Her kitty face was hideous to look at even when she was alive, so the very thought of looking at it now she’s dead gives me the bloody runs.

Apparently, ever since Selina's death, that kid's been moping near Orlémurs Cemetery, howling at the moon. If I know life, and I do, he's got with him the key to the chest we buried with that bitch.

   1205837|32953dcb||Maximus Macrinus was once a knight errant famed for showing no mercy to any bandits prowling the Champs-Désolés. After a long and storied career, he hung up his sword at his ancestral manor and settled in for a well-deserved retirement. No one knows what brought about the subsequent murder of his entire family. Some claim a giant descended from the mountains, others, that he ran afoul of one of the larger hanses. The only undisputed fact is that everyone with any sense now avoids going anywhere near Casteldaccia.

Since Quayle means to diddle our derrières, let’s diddle Quayle. Grab him, scorch his heels and find out where he’s hid his share of the previous raid. He can’t possibly have lost all of it playing gwent. Once you’ve got that, time for him to dance the grim fandango.

I know how upset you must be at having to spend the next few weeks in a field hospital, but my heart rejoices that you will not be risking your life on the battlefield.<br><br>Tamara grows and grows and grows. She can even stand up now, if she holds on to something, though she's still quite unsteady on those chubby little legs.

Yesterday she almost poured a bowl of hot soup all over herself! I think I will take on that miller girl as help, because I'm afraid one day I won’t catch Tamara in time. Especially now, when you are gone and I must look after all our household affairs myself. Dear Phillip, I miss you dreadfully and eagerly await your return. Every day I pray to Melitele for your health, and our daughter's, and for our family to be whole once more. I hope this horrible war will end soon. I love you.<br><br>Yours forever,<br><br>Anna
   1208407|334c83d2||The transmutation of bodies is one of the most difficult tasks any mage can undertake – indeed, only the true masters of the Art have ever accomplished it, and even they have only perfected one of its forms. This difficulty arises from psychophysical limitations, since a mage can only safely transform into an animal with which he is perfectly attuned. A famous example is that of Ulf Blackbeard, who dwelled for years in a cave with a bear in order to imbibe the life essence of that animal.

   1206695|33cb6a09||Amadeus Cianfanelli was born to a family of humble traders, but, thanks to hard work and innate entrepreneurial talent, by the age of fifty he had already established a flourishing bank. It soon became clear, however, that for the ambitious Amadeus, this was just the beginning. He quickly expanded the business, establishing Cianfanelli Bank branches in Kovir and Nazair and even sending a representative to Zerrikania. He became known for treating each and every customer as an old friend and cared deeply about what became of others’ coin. He thus created a wide range of banking products to better allow him to look after the property of an increasingly greater number of customers. He coined the phrase that up until today has served Cianfanelli as an advertising slogan and motto: “We look after your coin as if it were our own.”

In order to recognize the individual administering it, it makes use of a portal mounted at the entrance of the area it is to defend. This portal passes streams of magical energy through the body of the person entering and can, in the blink of an eye, determine if this person has the corporeal signature (eyeball structure included) of the entitled administrator. As a result, the only unauthorized individuals that can possibly hope to enter are mimics.<br><br>DRM thus makes for an extremely effective and near-unbreakable security measure - but you are in luck, for you hold in your hands the key to bypassing it, namely the present tome, Gottfried’s Omni-opening Grimoire, or GOG for short. In the pages to follow you will find innumerable methods for deactivating DRM, or, even better, bypassing it altogether (…)

   1205858|34965e7d||At Belgaard Vineyard, a famous act of poisoning once occurred which took the lives of a large gang of bandits who were ransacking the area. The folk charged with cleaning up in the aftermath originally planned to burn the bodies, but one pious soul thought even rotten dung-diddlers such as they deserve better. He thus paid for their bodies to be laid to rest in a small cemetery: Mère-Lachaiselongue. Later, Sir Ramon of Gichon died a martyr’s death here while trying to get rid of the bandits’ constantly returning wraiths.

Its territory encompasses the isle of Thanedd, home to the famous magic academy, which, along with Gors Velen, constitutes the commercial and developmental mainspring of the entire province. Velen is a stop on the Novigrad trade route running through Cidaris, Vergen, Brugge, Cintra and other such southerly realms.<br><br>Veleners subside primarily on agriculture, crafting and animal husbandry. The province is practically deprived of all natural resources. It contains a great deal of forests, wetlands and cultivated woods, though the greatest part of it is covered in swamps and bogs (…).

   1206354|356b1bb2||To Whomever Finds This Letter:<br>My names is Julius ban Gavh'e and if you are reading these words, I am surely long dead. As befits one of my station and familial connections I was sent to study at Ban Ard, the famed school for mages, yet I was never to complete those studies. For the entire duration of my life magic held but a weak hold over a soul ravished by a passion for organic alchemy. It was to that most wondrous of sciences I dedicated the most beautiful years of my life, and the table beside which you now most surely stand is the fruit of those labors of love.<br><br>If you are a fellow lover of alchemy, I hazard to guess you will be filled with rapture to behold my discovery. If, however, that marvelous science is unknown to you, please heed my advice – drop this letter, step away from the table and never return. The practice of alchemy by amateurs can lead to injury and even death.<br><br>If you did not drop this letter after that last paragraph, you are no stranger to alchemy – thus I shall now reveal to you in a few brief words the fundaments of the alchemy table I designed. Leaving aside all unnecessary detail, my chief discovery consisted of a formula and tools allowing for the transmutation of mutagens taken from monsters into mutagens of the more common sort. I know this sounds highly unlikely, but I have proven with utmost certainty that this is possible.<br><br>The workings of this transmutation are simple – one must simply make use of the table which I designed. As an expert in the arcane art of alchemy, you certainly already know your way around such devices. If you are but an amateur, a member of the hoi polloi who has by accident wandered to this abandoned place – back away, lest your ignorance do your grievous harm.<br><br>You are surely asking yourself why I hid my discovery from the world, why I did not share my formula with the community of alchemists… Well, let us say I have forever been regarded as eccentric, aloof. And I have always believed it is pure chance and not men themselves that determine destiny. Furthermore, I have never sired offspring and have no desire to entrust my opus to a mere acquaintance. I thus concluded the best solution was to hide my table and trust that chance will – if my theory is correct – bring a man here who shall know how to make use of it, whom it shall delight and to whom it will prove of great use. Whether I am right or wrong – time will tell.<br><br>Use my gift wisely and fare you well,<br>Julius ban Gavh'e, alchemist

We have only a bare legend about the vineyard being founded by the owner of the Pomerol estate’s son, who had been disinherited and exiled with only a Carvanere sapling to his name.<br><br>The modern history of Corvo Bianco begins with Master Bolius, who settled in the vineyard in his elder years. As a young man, Bolius had headed a division of sappers which fought in the far north. For his service, he was made a noble and awarded a great deal of coin. He took to rebuilding Corvo Bianco with great zeal. He dedicated the most energy to planting a beautiful garden for his wife, thus starting the craze for the use of herbs which swept Toussaint at the time. After his wife, Bolius’ second love was the olive tree, which is why he planted a great many of them all over Corvo Bianco.<br><br>When Bolius’ wife died, life lost its savor for him and he began to think constantly about death. He sold his estate to Count Crespi, and the very day he signed the last piece of paperwork, he died.

By the power of said decree, each knight thus rendering aid will be rewarded according as per the following: a remuneration of the “Heron” type (in the case of aid in a battle against one human opponent) or of the “Crane” type (in the case of aid in a battle against more than one human opponent or a nonhuman opponent), to be paid from the funds of the knight receiving aid within one fiscal month.<br>Above-mentioned “Crane”-type remuneration has been awarded to the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who lent assistance to Sir X (the chivalric vows guarantee certain safeguards of personal privacy). Sir X was traversing the ruins near Mont Crane castle (in the Champs-Désolés) for purposes to be left unnamed (to further safeguard his identity) when he was attacked by members of the criminal organization led by Filibert von Wittan, alias Fourfingers. The group was dispersed and its members liquidated, pursuant to Her Illustrious Grace’s Order of March 24th, 1264, on the Protection of the Borderlands.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 15% to take into account the tax on assistance rendered while under the influence of toxic substances and immediate payment in species.

But truly important business is conducted not in the city, but at this modest merchant’s camp, an outpost far from the wine- and song-laden atmosphere of Beauclair's eternal celebrations.

   1080893|37fb3985||Fellow Northerners! The enemy never sleeps! The Black Devils have pitched camp other side of the river. Our lads will defend us to their last bolt and last drop of blood, but you, too, need to be prepared to serve your fatherland. Steel and blood aren't the only things a man can wield in the fight for Redania - a wary eye and a cocked ear do battle just as well. So if you see a stranger hanging about your village, or someone hiding in the bush, or you hear someone talking with a foreign accent, send an envoy to the nearest outpost at once, because you might've just spotted a Nilfgaardian spy. Do this, and you not only serve Redania, but you enrich yourself as well, for we will reward all such help as generously as it deserves.<br><br>Together, shoulder to shoulder, onwards, to victory!<br><br>–Captain Vit Freyman

   1058823|38306aee||Love knows no bounds, the saying claims. History knows no better proof of this adage than the romance between Lara Dorren and Cregennan of Lod.<br>She – a powerful elven Sage, bearer of the Elder Blood, promised to the great Avallac’h. He – a human mage of great talent and humble birth. She – able to live centuries, if not millennia. He – likely to live no more than three score years and ten, like each of us. They should have hated each other, scorned each other. Instead, they burned for one another with powerful love.<br>Heedless to the war raging around them, to the condemnations and curses raining down on them from all sides, they led a humble and happy life. Soon Lara was with child. A babe born of Lara and Cregennan might have joined the best of both races, united them at long last. Alas, this was not to be.<br>Humans considered Cregennan a traitor and a renegade. They demanded he abandon Lara - and when he refused, they decided to murder them both. Cregennan died, while Lara, still heavy with child, escaped with her life. She ran to Tretogor, to beg succor and support from Cerro, Queen of Redania.<br>What then came to pass? Here elven and human sources diverge, presenting two irreconcilable versions. According to the chroniclers of the Aen Seidhe, ”…Her pleas did not soften the stony dh’oine hearts, the hearts of merciless and cruel humans. When Lara, pleading for mercy, if not for her, then at least for her child, clutched on to the door of the royal carriage, the queen ordered her maimer to strike with his sword and cut off her fingers. That night, crushed by a fierce frost, Lara breathed her last sigh, on a hill, in the woods, giving birth to a daughter whom she protected with the fading embers of her own warmth.” Human legends, however, have Cerro saying, ”Ask not me for grace, ask instead those whom you have harmed with your magic. Brave you were when you wrought those foul deeds, brave be you now, when the pursuit of justice nears. Your sins are not in my power to forgive.” In reply, Lara said, "My doom is at hand, but yours, queen, is also nigh. Remember Lara Dorren in that terrible hour, queen, remember her death and her curse. And know that my curse will hound you and your seed, to the tenth generation will it damn your line.”<br>Wherein lies the truth cannot be said. Both versions are surely false, for both seek to blacken their enemy. Sad is Lara’s end - the hate between races which Cregennan wished so badly to end is now so strong that its darkness has forever obscured the truth of her fate.

   1208389|3882c2eb||To be delivered personally to Damien de la Tour<br><br>Dear Commander,<br>We, the undersigned, turn to you with a polite request to provide protection to our humble settlement on Coopers’ Slope, for we live in fear of acts of rampage and destruction on the part of giants descending from Mount Gorgon. As recently as a week ago, one such giant attacked our cooper’s workshop, destroyed our yard, stole one of the barrels and put it on his head (as if donning a helm!). Heedless to our warnings that this contradicted the item‘s intended use and might lead to unpredictable side effects, it then fled towards the Sansretour River. The ducal paper pushers refuse to believe our words and we are afraid those monsters will kill us all in our sleep. We thank you in advance for considering our humble plea. <br><Br>Amelia<Br>Carol<Br>Jacob<Br>Grégoire<Br>Caroline

   1073497|38c77094||The baron said we'd die of hunger in a week if we left his service. That he'd already looted all the peasants in Velen bare, and there weren't nothing left for us to steal. Well, he might've been right about that... but there's still the peasants themselves, and in Nilfgaard they're fungible goods. We've already broken bread with a fellow who rounds up men for the Black Ones. We threw him a few hayseeds we'd found wandering the woods - he paid top coin for each and told us to keep them coming.<br><br>So we're preparing a manhunt the likes of which Velen's never seen. Like any proper hunting party, we've split into two groups. We're camping out here, while the rest are west of Crow's Perch. We'll go at the same time, from two sides, so none can run away.<br><br>Funny, aren't they - life's surprises. When we were with the baron, we thought the peasants worthless dung. And here it turns out each one's a bill of exchange, just waiting to be turned in for gold.

   1209237|394b22ea||Few know that sound is in fact not just a noise, but a wave - just like the waves of a sea striking against the shore. And just like them, sound waves strike everything in their path, which causes them to break. This particular property of sound is used by some species of animals and monsters as they carry out a kind of terrain mapping using their sense of hearing. Bats, which produce a specific sound to conduct echolocation based on how this sound's waves bounce off potential obstacles, make for a good example of this. Curiously, shaelmaars – mighty, though completely blind monsters – have developed a similar mechanism. They are able to locate their opponents by sensing the vibration of even the faintest sound wave.

   1058798|394d5d4d||Many think “Aen Saevherne“ - meaning Sage - is simply the Elder Speech term for sorcerer. Yet to equate a Sage with a common practitioner of magic is akin to considering a newly-drafted private, hay sticking out of his breeches, a witcher's equal simply because both wield swords.<br><br>A Sage wields magic, true, and does so with greater skill than even the most accomplished of human mages. The great renown and regard in which they are held, however, comes not from this skill but from the other, truly rare abilities they possess.<br><br>Nothing is secret for an elven Sage. They see both past and future as easily as the present. They have mastery over all the arcana of magic as well as every domain of scholarship. They are the only ones who understand the nature and operation of the so-called Elder Blood and the gene of Lara Dorren - and they guard this knowledge jealously.<br><br>How numerous are the elven Sages? In all my life I have met only one, Ida Emean of the Blue Mountains. She might possibly be the last representative of this mysterious caste. It is true I have encountered mention a male elf who might also belong to it, but as of this writing I have been unable to confirm this.

The sagacious Elementalist who has tamed a magic Minion should not heed the sweet yet pernicious Urge to unbind the Being, for only Harm will come of it, Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth will be the only result. Likewise he who tightens his Servant's yoke overmuch will gain nothing from it, for his enchained Being will be to him dumb and dull as a Lump of Earth.<br><br>The Key is to prepare a proper magic Barrier, one whose effectiveness shall be backed by a crystal of power.

It is true that Syanna awakes each night with a scream - unless she is sleeping in the same bed as Anarietta.<br><br>-II-<br><br>The girls quarreled today. Unfortunately, I must note that they did not behave in a manner becoming for young ladies: there were fisticuffs! Anna Henrietta was first to hit her sister, but Syanna didn't wait long to reply. Before I could break them apart, little Anarietta had lost two milk teeth, and she ran straight to her parents to complain. His Grace the Duke couldn't believe his ears when I told him what had happened. Syanna got the whole blame and was suitably punished. Anarietta then tried to ease the situation, but the Duke and Duchess were resolute.<br><br>-III-<br><br>Today for the first time I accompanied the girls to the Land of a Thousand Fables, where we spent half a day. First we played with Thumbelina and then with Redbeard, who was extremely gallant for a highwayman. I am thoroughly impressed by what the master Artorius Vigo has achieved. He has proved that he has no equal in magical mysteries. The girls said that if I wish to go there by myself, all I have to do is open the book Land of a Thousand Fables and say out loud the spell: Expecto ludum!<br><br>-IV-<br><br>Today, Syanna was tested by the mages sent by the Chapter. I don't know what conclusions they drew, but His Grace the Duke is clearly worried. I asked the Duke what awaits the princess. He didn't reply.<br><br>-V-<br><br>I tutored the girls in Nilfgaardian today. Syanna applies herself so, though she has great difficulty memorizing new vocabulary. Lady Anarietta seems more gifted in this regard, yet also prone to impish behavior. When she thought me out of earshot, she called me a 'bloede kusse.' She and Syanna laughed so hard they almost choked.<br>

Of course, in truth there's no griffin nor any other beast more dangerous than a rat in these parts. It's all just the sort of rubbish old hags babble about to waste time while drawing water.

   1206374|3bd88c84||There were many brave and true knights in the service of the old duke, but the greatest of them all was Luis Alberni. His crest showed a red field with a golden star, each of whose five points stood for one of the chivalric virtues.<br><br>Yet fame and glory went to Alberni’s head. Years passed and he began to think himself the most perfect of all knights. In the end, he came to think he was virtue incarnate and there was no one in the world who preceded him in this regard, something even the Lady of the Lake must recognize. Alberni thus set off to see her and have her pay him homage in honor of his excellency.<br><br>Yet as Alberni approached the Lady’s home, his body and equipment began to change. The slender knight grew more and more corpulent, until his horse could finally no longer bear him. His sword first became wooden, then turned into a mace, and his shining armor became dull and turned to ash. All he had left was his helmet, which turned into a wooden cage.<br><br>Alberni stood on the shore of the lake, wishing to speak, yet all that came from his lips was a wild cry. The knight peered at his reflection in the lake’s waters and understood he had become a giant. The Lady of the Lake then emerged and said: You abandoned the chivalric virtues long ago. Of all your sins, the greatest was pride. It has changed your sword into a mace, deprived you of armor and made your flesh into that of a beast. From now on you shall be known as Golyat. Go to Mount Gorgon, where you shall live in this form far from the eyes of men, accompanied by the painful memory of your lost glory, until the day death mercifully frees you from your torment.

   1206001|3dbb8657||Monstrous curses and their description <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Curses that change a fellow into a monstrous creature have existed since the dawn of time. They have a variety of origins and a variety of effects. It normally happens that a mage or sorceress casts a curse and the spell changes the subject. It doesn't always happen straight away. Sometimes, the person who has been cursed changes slowly bit by bit. It also happens that a normal fellow can cast a curse, someone whose conscience is clear and who has done good in their life. Such a person can acquire power and thus the aggrieved can place a curse on the evildoer. Such curses are strong and cannot be removed easily. Thus, everything by which human suffering is atoned is long lasting and painful.

Most recently they snatched up Gilbert, plucked him right off the wall. Gilbert was usually quite alert, but every man drops his guard a bit when emptying his water. Filibert’s furious. The cost of schooling a fresh-faced recruit into a functional member of our group is not inconsiderable. To have that cost turned into monster droppings – that’s regrettable waste.<br>Day Seven<br>We ambushed a caravan of merchants trekking from eastern Toussaint. They had no guards and put up no resistance, yet still we made virtually no profit – the shoddy rags they carried could only interest bare-bummed Skellige wildmen, and none of our group plans to voyage in that direction. Filibert grew furious yet again and killed one of the merchants, a man named Lumierex. The rest set off back east.<br>Day Eleven<br>Our scouts tracked down three men sneaking through the woods. They were all dressed as beggars and claimed to be such. We weren’t fooled. After a bit of rough play, they were revealed to be jewelers carrying gold from the mines of Maecht. Unrefined ore only, but of promising grade. Filibert ordered the jewelers killed. He hates liars with a passion.<br>Day Seventeen<br>An expedition from the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian’s pitched tent on the other side of the Sansretour. Scholars are not known to suffer from excess wealth, yet these have capacious tents and ample amounts of alcohol. Thus their fate was sealed. Filibert sent a few men their way.<br>Day Twenty-Three<br>It’s been almost two weeks since anything of interest came along the high road. Meanwhile, knights errant have caught more of our lads. Two died, one was merely wounded and escaped. We lost equipment worth a great many crowns. Filibert ordered the wounded man flogged for carelessness. His weary body couldn’t take it and he died.<br>Day Twenty-Four<br>Our luck has turned. We caught a vintner’s caravan returning from the South. They had sold their goods and were carrying a great deal of coin. Preliminary calculations estimate takings of around four hundred crowns for each of us. Filibert has yet to decide if we will divide it equally.<br>Day Twenty-Eight<br>The unit sent to Basane Farm never returned with supplies. The vittles situation is tight. Man cannot live on alcohol alone, nor has anyone yet found a way to eat gold. We must plunder a few villages.<br>Day Thirty<br>I shall now perform a final accounting of the month of Blathe. We are in the black – and how. It seems we shall stay in this area another month.

   1209053|3e6cfad9||I once quarreled with a man who insisted no substantial differences separate spriggans and leshens. The knave riled me greatly, for he had seen nearly nothing of life, yet spoke with the haughtiness of a witcher or other such professional for whom monsters are his stock and trade. One evening at the inn, his blather soured my beer such that I decided to prove to him a spriggan resembles a leshen only in the most superficial ways.<br><br>I thus took him deep into a wild wood and together we walked for upwards of two hours. I recalled having spied a spriggan there a year earlier and had heard the beasts are not fond of changing their place of dwelling. During my previous encounter, I had taken great fright at once and run off as fast as my legs would carry me. Later, I found out that, if undisturbed, a spriggan will rarely attack a human. Unfortunately, during my second encounter I learned the hard way that noise disturbs them. Greatly. When my acquaintance began engaging in loud mockery and cruel ribbing, chortling in raucous laughter all the while, a monster suddenly sprouted out of the ground before our very feet.<br><br>I could take no satisfaction in being proved correct, for the spriggan knocked my unfortunate fool of a colleague to the ground in one powerful blow and then trod him till his innards squirted out of every possible opening. I tried to escape, but it was as if my legs had planted roots in the ground. Meanwhile, the spriggan brought silence to the wood, shot me a stare and then sauntered off, as if nothing had happened.<br><br>That was, I pray, my last encounter with a spriggan and the last time I shall have to explain to anyone why those monsters are different from leshens.<br>

   1211199|3ec11d1a||The Belhaven school of drama, also known as the “school of the second entrance,” was defined by the director and playwright Severen Stallis. Stallis was a proponent of intensifying the dramatic action in the second act, during which the most characteristic aspect of his work would take place: the main character’s second entrance. During the second act, the play’s hero would also be forced to undergo a distinct transformation, one which would determine the fate he would meet in the third.<br>The Belhaven school stood in opposition to the Beauclair tradition of drama, where the second act rarely saw the principal characters through any serious transformations. Its role was rather to build tension en route to the grand finale taking place in the third act.

Who hasn't felt a cold chill run down his spine when he catches sight of a pack of five of twenty of them hunting in the woods?<br><br>These beautiful animals are treated by men as enemies - and not without reason, for they attack flocks of domesticated animals and during times of exceptional frost will even kill horses. Yet they are noble beasts, endowed with great intelligence and displaying a strength and independence that no man can help but admire.
   1081035|3eee3354||Good folk of Skellige, last week in the moors I found a man. Not moving a bit, so figured him for a stiff. Turned out he was breathing, but was so drunk he had booze instead of blood in his veins. I did not want him to freeze, for while it may be spring, the nights are still cold, so I took him to my house. The moment he sobered up a bit he drank my whole supply of mead, ploughed my wife and stole my brother's horse. I'm warning you, if you ever meet a drunkard called Odrin, best slay him on the spot and avenge me!

   1076406|3fc4655e||Despite what you might have heard, the first golem was created not by a powerful mage or an elven Sage, but by a simple dwarf from Maribor named Bonaventura Sesto - a brickmaker.<br><br>The fateful act of creation took place over a century ago, when the persecution of nonhumans was in full swing in Maribor. Elves and dwarves had been accused of bringing an epidemic to the city - though it was later discovered the outbreak had been caused by a man named Mattheo, a barkeep's dogsbody at the Golden Goose Inn. This Mattheo was charged with both serving meals and cleaning the latrines, and would only wash his hands once a month, and then not very thoroughly. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>The persecution of nonhumans was limited at first to robbing their shops, arson and the occasional beating, but the violence soon escalated into a bloody pogrom. As the city guard looked on without lifting a finger, humans murdered elves and dwarves during three days and three nights of slaughter, killing over three hundred individuals, including the aforementioned Bonaventura Sesto's entire family.<br><br>Driven mad with grief and thirsting for vengeance, Bonaventura molded a ten-foot-tall humanoid out of clay, and then carved the names of the slain nonhumans onto it, along with a smattering of dwarven curses. Once finished, he slit his own throat - and when his blood splattered his gigantic statue, it came alive and started walking towards the city. Bonaventura had his sweet revenge on his persecutors - his creation killed almost five hundred humans, including the mayor and the entire city council, before the soldiers from the city garrison could take it out using their ballista.<br><br>The Conclave's later investigation found that Bonaventura had possessed hidden magic talent. Though he had never had any training, the torrent of powerful emotions running through him at the time of his death flushed out his latent powers and created from them a new spell. After numerous alterations and improvements, one can now cast this spell without sacrificing one's life - and golems guard laboratories, libraries and palaces across the Continent.

Said manor had previously been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of the brother-in-law of its current owners, a certain Monsieur Eduard de Mouton, his Crest a Fox Cub. Above-mentioned designation was based on reports of monstrous presences on the lands of said estate, inferred to be due to a lurking leshen.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster deemed a spriggan (W3 classification: relict.) The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 21% to take into account tribute exacted for the sustenance of mutilated veterans and payment made immediately in species.

   1084572|40e8f83a||The disciples of the Isles' local pantheon are not the sole spiritual devotees in Skellige, for some druids also call the archipelago home. Yet this is no cause for conflict, for Freya's adherents and the Druids' Circle coexist and treat each other with great respect. What welds these two faiths together? A common worship of the divinity found in the earth, fertility, love and birth. To the druids, men form a part of nature and should treat the world around them with the utmost respect. They hold that since nature gave life, her most precious gift, to humans and the other civilized races, they should live in harmony with her, yielding their will to hers.<br><br>Druids are seen as wise men and priests and are held in high esteem by society. They act as spiritual guides, herbalists and alchemists. Skelligers seek their counsel in times of trouble, summon them when ill and ask them to settle thorny conflicts. Like their continental brethren, the druids of Skellige have a Circle - an area set aside in their holy grove where they assemble, meditate and study sacred tomes. Many druids are capable of wielding magic.

Some fleders hunt alone, whereas others prefer to attack in groups. Perhaps it is a matter of instinct – having sensed blood, they assess the size of the victim and, if necessary, summon their kin. The only strong suit of these leeches is their ability to leap towards a potential victim.<br><br>Fighting a fleder is no different than fighting any other kind of bloodsucker. Apart from the obvious means, such as garlic, buckthorn, and sunlight, a hunter should stock up on silver. A lit torch may prove helpful as well.

Walk in the iron shoes to the end of the world, pat the ground before you with the staff, and sprinkle it with tears. Walk through fire and water, do not stop, do not look back. And when your shoes wear out, and when the iron staff shatters, when the wind and the heat dry your eyes so that you cannot shed another tear, then you will have reached the world's end, and you will have found what you seek and what you love. Perhaps."<br><br>And so the witcher walked through fire and water without looking back. But he took neither the iron shoes nor the staff. He took only his witcher's sword. He did not heed the words of the fairy. And that is good, for she was an evil fairy.

To be delivered personally to the commander of Intelligence Cell Cardinal.<br><br>We have arrived in the Novigrad area. The knights’ detachment is stronger than previous reports indicated.

Fine, all the more for us. Tomorrow we'll sail to Spikeroog, see what the merchant wenches have brought to market.

   1206024|42d728db||Sangreal (alternatively Sang Real, literally Royal Blood)<br>The legendary line which some trace back to the first lords of the lands now lying in Toussaint and northwestern Haakland. The first mention of Wilhelm the Bold, this line’s founder, comes from elven manuscripts found during reconstruction of the Beauclair palace in 1095. Since this source, like all things elven, is unreliable and should not be taken into consideration by historians, the existence of House Sangreal must be considered a mere fable.<br><br>Salvaress (or Salvarez), di, of the <i>regulus platinum</i> crest. This line takes its name from Salvar the Lame, who was made a count in the year 1189 by Duchess Caroberta for his service to the ducal throne. The di Salvaress line’s crest depicts a <i>regulus platinum</i>, one of the so-called silver basilisks whose existence is highly suspect, its classification as a species considered erroneous by most zoologists.<br><br>Toricella of the Two Towers crest. An ancient line whose founders most likely first settled the lands of present-day Toussaint around the year 984. They waged fierce war against the elves until the 6th decade of the 11th century, when all of what is now Toussaint fell under human control.

   1211291|43c32c43||Dear Jean-Louis.<br><br>As you instructed, I have taken a post as Assistant Royal Hairdresser to King Tancred Thyssen and have been active in that position for two months.<br><br>I dash this note off to you now because I must inform you of a most startling development. After weeks of analysis, consultations with specialists and trial runs on model doppelgangers, the Chief Royal Hairdresser, Master Hector, has decided to give Marziaola, the king’s current favorite, a… bob! Of course, Marzaiola, being a mere king’s mistress, cannot indulge in such extravagances as an asymmetric bob or an daringly shaved nape, therefore her bob is rather of the classically elegant sort, with a fringe that wonderfully complements the line of her eyes and covers her altogether unfortunate forehead.<br>Just as we speculated, the bob shall soon make a triumphant reentry as the absolute rage of the royal salon, and thanks to me, you, my dear friend, are now the first hairdresser of the South to know about it! I thus declare my mission accomplished and a stunning success! I’ll gather up my trappings and prepare to return. I hope you are ready for a long and eventful tête-à-tête once I arrive, and I hope that will be soon, for this seaside climate really does not suit me one bit, and this swill they call wine in Kovir is positively disgusting.<br><br>Warm Embraces,<br>Edgard Lavalliere

   1206237|440625ce||Est Est, often considered one of the chief treasures of the people of Toussaint, is the best known of the wines cultivated in that region. It is hard to determine when, exactly, the first barrels of Est Est were matured, though we can surmise it must have been around the time of the first human forays into the duchy’s present lands. What is certain is that this wine truly gained fame only during the reign of Duchess Adela Marta, who held Est Est in near divine esteem and for that reason bestowed upon Castel Ravello the privilege of being the official ducal vineyard. She also reserved a special place in the cellars of the Beauclair Palace for Est Est, and to this day two barrels of every vintage are ceremoniously deposited on those shelves. The tapping of any of them is, by order of the ducal edict “Vino Sanctus Est,” punishable by death through dragging behind a team of horses.

Suspect was detained pending trial. Upon detention he was searched and a diagram for the forging of a steel sword was found on his person. It is suspected this sword was used to intimidate or possibly kill the kidnapped child. It is likewise suspected that the accused possesses other such diagrams for the forging of death-dealing implements, though none have been found to date. Sir Ignatius has requested the witcher undergo preliminary interrogation with the application of torture. This will take place once a torturer with the proper qualifications has been found.<br><br>Addendum:<br>It was later discovered drowners were responsible for the boy’s disappearance. Unfortunately Kolgrim died before this information reached the investigators, for rather than face the baronet's judgment, he chose trial by ordeal. Sir Ignatius agreed and ordered he cleanse the Verrieres family crypt of specters. Kolgrim never emerged from said crypt. It is highly likely the motley wraiths, specters and evil powers residing therein proved too much for him.

   1078909|44a4b4b7||The peasants of the Tukaj Foothills say fiends are born of magic. For at times witches cast spells on bears causing them to mount boars, and the resultant offspring is neither boar nor bear, but has the makings of a fiend.<br><br>Usually such boar piglets die of hunger, but they are at times found and taken in by witches. Raised on enchanted milk, they grow in strength, and soon enough the milk is no longer enough for them. Now fiends, they start hunting and kill their victims with the ferocity of a boar and the strength of a bear. Yet they remain ever true to their mothers, meaning the witches. The witches protect them from danger, answer their every summons and aid them in all things.

   1136607|44c3da16||Dear Master Borsodi,<br><br>I write to you concerning a most atypical matter, but please do not dismiss it summarily, for both you and the institution you run are in great danger. Allow me to explain what I mean.<br><br>It so happens I am a renowned astrologist and teller of fortunes. In recent days, for evident reasons, I have been forced into hiding, but a small circle of loyal customers has been kept informed of my whereabouts. One of these customers is a lady of high birth - her name I shall not disclose out of discretion. Said lady came to me with a request: she wanted to learn what price would be certain items would sell for at an upcoming auction.<br><br>After voicing my many objections, I nevertheless relented to the lady’s request - but before you take offense at this interference in your business, please read to the end, for the cards I laid out for this lady told me something very important.<br><br>The constellation of the cards clearly indicated a wolf shall appear at your doorstep and you shall not let him enter, but he shall nevertheless find a way inside. He shall enter your house, then take your house from you. I saw a tower struck by lightning and blood drinking blood. I believe you are extremely aware what that signifies, am I not right?<br><br>As fair reward for this warning, please hand a sum of two thousand crowns to the man delivering this message. <br><br>My sincerest respects,<br>Master Matthew

   1206365|44d7ce25||The night of the Feast of Saint Nepomucen two patrons exiting the Clever Clogs Inn came across a corpse lying in the gutter. Both witnesses – Xavier and Bruno – are known to the Ducal Guard as they have previously been convicted of petty theft. Seeing the highly unusual circumstances of the deceased’s death, the witnesses informed the Ducal Guard and Guardsmen arrived on the scene in short order.<br><br>The victim was identified as Ramon du Lac, a knight errant in the ducal service. Sir du Lac was dressed in a nightgown and nightcap, with a pillow placed under his head and a bedwarmer placed in his hand. His clothing and the pillow had been soaked through by the gutter’s contents.<br><br>The victim perished as a result of being pierced through the heart by long claws. The blow was dealt with great precision. The Guardsmen searched for any fragment of a five-pointed star near the body (as was found in the case of Count Crespi), yet their search yielded no results. Witnesses Xavier and Bruno deny having taken any such item for themselves.

   1208761|45fc611d||During a visit to the court of the king of Nazair, Waltharius the Brawny fell madly in love with the king's daughter, the beautiful Hiltgunt, who was already promised to a prince from Metinna. Waltharius, paying no heed to these politically-inspired marriage plans, captured the princess’ heart and together they ran off to Toussaint. The prince from Metinna, unable to let such an affront pass, followed the star-crossed lovers. Yet Waltharius was renowned for his courage and might and thus slew his adversary with ease. Then he and his beloved returned to his family estate at Dun Tynne.<br><br>To his dismay, it turned out his brother Vislavius had nearly led the estate to bankruptcy while Waltharius had been in Nazair. Waltharius threw his brother into the dungeon and, as befits a self-respecting nobleman, embarked on a knightly expedition. Unfortunately his young wife, Hiltgunt, tortured by her solitude, freed Vislavius and became his lover. When Waltharius returned and realized he had been cuckolded, he murdered them both in a fit of passion and despair. Then he sat down and wept and wept and wept…

    519864|46072d3c||Most historians ascribe the trial, sentencing and execution of Joachim de Wett to the violent, cruel and tyrannical nature of Emperor Emhyr, although many authors with a predilection for sensationalizing propose loaded hypotheses about vengeance and the settling of thoroughly private scores. It is high time to tell the truth – a truth that is and has long been more than clear to every scholar.<br><br>Duke de Wett led the Verden Group. To describe the manner in which he did so as “incompetent” would be far too kind. Facing a force half as strong as his own, he delayed the northern offensive, turning all his attention to the fight against the guerillas of Verden.<br><br>The Verden Group brought unheard of cruelties to bear against the civilian population. The result proved as predictable as it was inevitable - whereas in winter the insurgents numbered a mere half thousand, by spring nearly the entire country had taken up arms against us. King Ervyll, a loyal liege subject to the Empire, was killed, and his son, Crown Prince Kistrin, who sympathized with the Nordlings, was made king.<br><br>With Skellige raiders biting at his flanks, a Nordling offensive coming from Cidaris before him, and a rebellion at his rear, de Wett became bogged down in a chaotic struggle and suffered one defeat after another. This in turn delayed Army Group Center's offensive – instead of pinning down the Nordlings’ flanks as it was to, the Verden Group tied down Menno Coehoorn. The Nordlings took advantage of the situation immediately. They mounted a counter-offensive, breaking through the ring of forces encircling Mayena and Maribor, and thwarting any chance for the quick recapture of these important fortresses. De Wett’s incompetence ineptitude and stupidity also affected morale. The myth of an invincible Nilfgaard was shattered. New recruits began to pour into the armies of the North by the hundreds…

   1084570|46598d56||Leshens dwell in dense, primeval woods. Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within in their territory – and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Leshens old enough to earn the appellation “ancient” wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.<br><br>Some leshens create magic totems that increase their strength – in such cases these totems should be destroyed before or while fighting them. Furthermore, some leshens can create for themselves a kind of immortality in the following way: the leshen wounds a lost traveler passing through its woods with its claws and casts a black magic curse on him. For as long as the individual marked in this way stays near its territory, the leshen will be reborn every time it dies. Such leshens can only be defeated by driving away or killing the person they have marked.<br><br>In combat leshens use not only their long claws but also their many allies: wolves, who unfailingly answer their call, or ravens, which harass and distract the leshen’s opponent. Leshens are also able to bend plant life to their will and make it aid them in battle. It is a witcher’s good fortune that leshens do have one weakness - they are extremely vulnerable to the Igni Sign.

Here, in the Lake of Cleansing, I leave behind the last of the items which signify my attachment to my previous incarnation as a witcher.

That is why a key issue for hairdressers is how to look after this type of hair and also how to deal with that other eternal dilemma, split ends!<br>Unfortunately, in today’s world in which the magic potions of sorceresses reign, we have forgotten about traditional folk remedies. That's why here I shall put in writing a recipe for a conditioning balsam given to me by Patrice Ludovic, my grandfather and ducal hairdresser at the court of Carolina Roberta.<br><br>- One tablespoon of beeswax (make sure it is clear, uncontaminated with bee glue)<br>- Five tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil<br>- Five tablespoons of rapeseed oil<br>- Four and a half tablespoons of almond oil<br>- Six tablespoons, for a change, of castor oil,<br>- Four tablespoons of grapeseed oil (preferably from Castel Ravello vines, but Coronata will also do)<br><br>Then melt the whole mixture and when it reaches a temperature beyond that of boiling water, add essential oils according to preference (the best is lemon to emphasize the freshness of the scent). At the end, add a drop of sunflower oil and voilà! The balsam is ready!

I should never have agreed to give them passage. They've meant endless trouble from the moment we pulled out of Val, and all indications are that plenty more awaits ahead. The foreign royals' bizarre behavior does nothing to help - the crew calls them barbarians behind their backs and mutters about the expedition being cursed. The guide said he had been hired to take them to Beauclair - perhaps such strange customs will accord with those at Anna Henrietta's court, but first we must reach the Continent safely. Yet ever since we lost sight of our sister ship, I've had a bad feeling about our chances of doing so.<br><br>Day 73, Elinud<br><br>I might have known there would be trouble when the guide explained these royals were fleeing a coup that knocked them off their throne on their home island. I hear the woman speak to the child in that strange tongue of theirs. She spits out words whose very sound is so filled with hatred and contempt I need not guess at their exact meaning, for they are sure to be curses aimed at the usurper. She scans the horizon constantly, the dread plain on her face, no doubt fearing assassins have been sent after her.<br><br>Day 78, Elinud<br><br>My worries have been confirmed - our passengers will be our doom. The ship will soon sink. May our gods and theirs watch over us.

   1207171|481f7bce||Greetings to you, dear mother.<br><br>I write to you now, just before Midaëte, as I promised. I hope my letter finds you in good health. Very little of note has happened here since you left. Despite your warnings, we get on well with the humans. They are so fascinating in the way they obsess over death... Caoilfhionn, if you can imagine it, admitted to Bláthnaid she really likes Arnaud, the miller’s son. Personally, I’ve nothing against this, but I know where you are – in Dol Blathanna – that would be unthinkable.<br>I went to visit Maolsheachlann’s grave recently… Yes, I know you won’t approve of that. Since when do the Aen Seidhe care for the graves of their loved ones? Yet living among people necessarily means we take on some of their customs. While there, I happened to learn the humans plan to build a village near Crevan Carn. This is difficult, for personally it does not bother me, but Bláthnaid – you know her – began screaming about how this was a profanation and they have countless other perfectly good spots where they could build their village. I hope this will not grow into some larger conflict, we have it so good here… [rest of the letter is illegible]

How you were cross that I shirked working in the fields and didn't bring a scrap home to put in the pot? Well, you are gonna have to eat those words, my dear! Gobble them all up, with a hearty slice of humble pie and some baked crow on the side!<br><br>Yesterday we cornered this merchant. And not a Gors Velen or Brenna man, but from Nilfgaard itself, you see? From the City of Golden Towers! Didn't speak much Common, but enough so's we could understand each other. He said he was carrying some goods to the Black One's camp. We took everything he had, and I'm telling you, Helke darest, you've never seen so many crowns in your life, nor could you ever hope to count that high!<br><br>Now we're going to rough him up a bit more to make sure he hasn't hid some of his gold or goods. Once we cut off his thumbs he'll spill the beans about any extra treats stashed in the soles of his boots, and once Mirko scalds him a bit he'll tell us about the precious stones he's got sewn in the feedbag. Might tell us a great many such things of interest, in fact. You never know just what till you try.<br><br>Tell the young'uns Da's gonna be home soon. That he'll bring them toys and treats and they'll eat so many honeycakes their tummies're gonna burst. For you, Helke, I'll bring a silver necklace and brooch. Because while you can be awful cruel atimes, I still love you, you naughty bint.<br><br>-Izbor<br><br>P.S. Throw on that nightshirt with the lace and red beads for my arrival.

   1205372|4b3de703||My Dearest!<br><br>Everything here is good. For several days now the sun has been shining and it is quite hot, so the window in Clarissa's room is open almost all day. If you could see her little face when rays of sunlight hit it... Pure joy. She looks just like she was before the accident. If it gets a bit warmer, I will have her chair taken to the garden.<br><br>The day before yesterday, Master Buyvarde's wife, Elisa, visited us. You remember her don't you? When the Buyvarde's moved to Kovir, all the society ladies were scared of inviting her to dine as she seemed to be either mad or some sort of self-taught witch. This was all because, despite not having the right education, she made magic ointments and cosmetics. It is said that she spent three years in the Dragon Mountains learning from some elven sorceress... <br><br> You know I don't pay much heed to gossip, which is why when the butler announced her, I immediately invited her in for a glass of lemonade. It turns out that she is an exceedingly charming person, and stories of her alleged witchcraft are highly exaggerated -- she actually studied for three years at Aretuza, but because of some bad investments made by her father she had to leave the academy. She left, however, with a good knowledge of plants and their magical applications. She brought with her a healing ointment which I have to rub into Clarissa's legs each morning and evening for ten days. When the treatment is complete, Elisa promises to visit us again to see the results and advise us further. I have a good feeling about this woman. In my next letter, I'll tell you what happened with the treatment she recommended.<br><br>Take care of yourself my dearest. I beg that you don't overreact and do something silly, if something happened to you I wouldn't know what to do.<br><br>I love you,<br>Arabella

In 1260, afraid of the looming Nilfgaardian threat, Queen Calanthe sent Cirilla to the court of King Ervyll (see Ervyll of Verden), where the heiress of Cintra was to marry the heir to the throne of Verden, Prince Kistrin (see Kistrin of Verden). Though allying with Verden and gaining the aid of that realm’s army was at the time Calanthe's top priority, no marriage ever occurred, and Cirilla returned to her grandmother's court. In 1262, during the so-called Cintra Massacre, Cirilla went missing (…).

Their owners take great care to maintain the time-tested traditions and heirloom recipes on which the reputation of the wines they produce rests.

   1059021|4f487aa0||Which Northern Realm’s special forces are the greatest of them all? Once upon a time, the answer was clear: Redania. Its network of spies and informers was so vast that Tretogor knew which route the Nilfgaardian armies would take before they even left their barracks. No ruler kept any weakness or comprising secret from these astute spooks. Redanian intelligence had vast resources at its disposal, including the use of great sorceresses like Philippa Eilhart and shining stars from the world of culture. With their innovative interrogation techniques perfected in Drakenborg Fortress, its agents could extract vital information from even the tightest-lipped Scoia’tael guerilla, allowing them to reduce that organization on their soil to a hounded, desperate few.<br><br>The golden days of the Redanian spy service ended, however, along with the disappearance of its head, Sigismund Dijkstra. His fate still remains unknown to this day. According to some, he departed for voluntary exile after falling out with King Radovid. According to others, he was captured by enemy agents. Still others hold that Dijkstra was murdered by sorceresses, and his body disintegrated into a fine dust.<br><br>After Dijkstra’s disappearance, the royal council ordered a thoroughgoing audit of the spy corps. Radovid appointed a commission with a remit to search for abuses of power, root out double agents and suggest remedial measures. As usual, however, inserting civilians into the affairs of spies had the opposite of the desired effect. Shortly after the work began a list of agents and their sources leaked. Many on it were subsequently murdered or fell off the face of the earth. A few days sufficed to reduce to ashes an organization built over long years of hard work.

   1209223|4ffd7d0a||If you take a fleder and magnify all of its most primitive traits, you will get a protofleder. This beast, the fleder's distant ancestor, arrived here from a parallel sphere centuries past, yet, unlike the fleder, has remained untouched by any post-Conjunction evolutionary processes. In our time protofleders are extremely rare, the more suitably adapted fleders having taken over their niche in our biosphere.<br><br> Protofleders are thus lesser vampires. Their massive, wide jaws constitute their main weapons, their sharp claws coming in a close second.<br><br>Similarly to their more developed cousins, protofleders rely on their instincts rather than intelligence and are quite sensitive to the scent of blood. All the usual means of fighting vampires, such as vampire oil, Black Blood, and silver weapons, apply to them as well.

A large percentage of those I examined were assigned to patrols in areas stricken by plague.<br><br>I prescribed them all an innovative cure of my own devising that consists of astringent enemas, self-administered twice daily. Most of the ill miraculously recovered after only one day of this treatment, raising suspicions that the pains they suffered from might have been psychosomatic. That, of course, is highly improbable, given that our codex calls for malingerers to be punished very harshly.

   1057841|50e8dca3||Belief in the mythical snake Uroboros is widespread throughout all of Skellige. Winding itself up into a figure eight, the snake took its own tail between its teeth and in so doing created time. The circle of time will be complete when Uroboros once again bites its tail and closes the loop. This will commence the so-called<i>Final Age</i>, <i>Tedd Deireadh</i>, also called the <i>Time of the White Frost</i> or the <i>Wolven Blizzard</i>. It is thought many signs will foretell its coming - sources mention a wolf eating the sun and an eclipse of the moon. Next there will be a battle known as<i>Ragh nar Roog - the Last Battle, the Battle of Light and Dark</i>. It will begin with the appearance of a longship made of the claws of dead men and carrying an army of wraiths and demons. Standing watch for the coming of the longship in his hunting blind is a hero named Hemdall. The golden cockerel, Kambi, will warn of the longship's arrival, and then Hemdall will mount the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost, to stop the invading powers of darkness. As he goes to fight, Hemdall will sound his horn, and for Skelligers this will be the call to take up arms and join the Last Battle. This final conflict will decide whether eternal night will fall upon the world or a new dawn will rise.<br><br>A local legend recounts how all clans in Skellige can trace their lineage back to Hemdall. Supposedly one summer solstice he left his hunting blind and spied Heulyn, a goddess. They fell hopelessly in love and spent the entire summer together, yet when autumn came, Heulyn had to depart. That is why the summer months, when Heulyn stays with Hemdall in Skellige, are the most fortunate days in the Isles.<br><br>Six sons were born of Hemdall and Heulyn’s love, giving rise to the six clans of Skellige. Their father let them take one isle each, but before they did so, they had to prove their manliness in a fight for living space, by rooting out the aboriginal inhabitants or coming to an understanding with them. That is how the sons of Hemdall and Heulyn first gained renown, and the memory of their deeds is honored by their descendants, the members of the clans they founded.

   1068600|51851436||Dearest Lilly,<br><br>If you are reading this, that means both your father and I are dead. I have asked Egward to give you this letter only when it is certain neither of us will return.<br><br>A great deal happened while you were away at the Academy. One of your father’s ships sank and we fell into debt. I did not write you then because I did not want to worry you, did not want you to return – your education and future are what matters most to us. Our creditors began to call in our loans and refused to accept payment in installments. When we were forced to admit we could not return the entire sum, they swore to destroy us. Some thugs began following our every step, never letting us out of their sight. It was only a matter of time before the family secret was discovered. They directed the witch hunters to us and we were thrown in the dungeon. I heard the guards gossiping about how we are to have a show trial – and a show execution. I gave one my wedding ring and he agreed to allow Egward to visit us. Your father wishes to give him some final instructions and I want to give him this letter - our last, unexpected farewell.<br><br>Be strong, my sweet, for in your veins flows the blood of men and wolves, and with that comes responsibility. I forbid you to avenge us. That will not bring us life, and will only bring you the executioner’s axe. You cannot die, not in that way. You must prove with your life and conduct that men and lycanthropes can live together in harmony. Leave town as soon as possible. Take only what is necessary, say farewell to no one, do not show yourself in public. Journey to where we used to hunt when you were a young girl and brace for the worst. The people there surely do not remember us, but they are good, simple villagers – they will treat you with kindness. Let us hope the madness of this persecution will soon end and you will be able to return home. In the meantime, take care of yourself and do not let them provoke you. Remember who you are and do not let anyone convince you that is something evil – this is how you were born and you should be proud of it. Live for us. We love you.<br><br>Mother

   1072287|5194fc10||Nothing quite like war! The Redanians and Nilfgaardians are at each other's throats, and no one pays a whit of attention to us. We can rob, raid and kill till we get bored of it - which'll never happen.<br><br>Usually I never set ashore near populated places, but this time we had no choice. Our boat started taking on water after the last storm, we had to drag her onto dry land for some repairs. We were ready for a fight when we stepped onto the beach, but no one even tried to chase us off. Sometimes some of the baron's blowhards come to us, but taking care of them's no trouble.<br><br>Since we're not in any particular hurry, I've decided to build us a new vessel instead of patching up the old dinghy. Why not? Best take advantage of the turmoil while it lasts. I hear there's a boatyard nearby - that'll do just fine. And while we wait for a new ship, I'll send men out to look around for Queen Zuleyka's famous treasure. If it's worth a tenth of what I've heard, we'll all be rich. Well, I will, at least.

At first I merely suspected it, but now I am certain: our ship is being followed.<br><br>We've charted a course for shore. The captain wants to replenish supplies in a small village called Ursten, and then sail up the Pontar. The masts of the ship which sails after us are constantly visible on the horizon.<br><br>The worst is upon us. We shall drown. The shore was within our reach when a horrible wind blew us back. The gale tossed our ship against the rocks. We're taking on water. The yard fell and crushed my legs. I don't know what will come to pass now. I have failed them, have failed the heirs to the royal dynasty whom I was charged to escort safely to Beauclair... The sealed letters were in the chest which the sailors tossed overboard when the ship began to sink.<br><br>If they ever wash ashore, if anyone ever finds them and this journal, know that they need to be given to a woman answering to the name Viki. She does not know the local tongue, but if you read the words "Viedhog latrut alame hoir," she will know what to do. I hope she has survived - luckily, she and the child sail in another ship. The elder insisted we travel separately. He was right. I don't know who chases us... I only know that I shall soon die...

   1214669|532eeaeb||This hanse’s mighty odd. All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…<br><br>Well, we're botched. Just learned some white-haired half-man, half-monster took out Starling. Just diddling great. Now we need to get our bums out of this swamp before that freak gets us, too. If some other beast doesn't first. Without the hanse's support, tough times are ahead...

It is mainly grown for its olives, which are pressed for their oil, but is also prized among woodcarvers. The unquestionably most cherished tree in the region, however, is the Beauclair oak, which is used in the making of wine barrels. And the most important place in Toussaint for the processing of this tree is the Rioux-Cannes woodcutters' outpost.

You even drove the point home with a humorous comparison, saying, I believe, "same as a pig won't turn into a horse, not even if you strap a saddle on it and call it Black Beauty."<br><br>It is entirely possible that you are right. But if there exists even the shadow of a chance that my son has been imprisoned in the body of that monster, that some spell or curse has done this to him, then I will not rest until I try every possible way of helping him.<br><br>That is why I would ask you to refrain from further attempts at humor and keep your doubts to yourself. Instead, channel those energies towards doing the job for which you shall be paid. Catch the nekker, and collect your gold. The rest should not interest you.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br><br>-Robert de Mere

   1083693|548560bf||Winter was on its way and the lord once again started to think about what to do to oppress his people even more. One morning, at the crack of the cockerel's crow, he rode out into the village in a carriage pulled by two black horses, with his trusted page at his side to act as his scribe. The earth was sodden and a cruel mud covered the road, so the lord, not wanting to dirty his shiny new boots, stayed in his carriage and sent his page to do his bidding.<br><br>When they arrived at the village, the page dismounted from the carriage, a paper covered in thick ink clutched in his hands. He nailed the paper to the first hut he saw, and since he did it with a hammer, a peasant boy named Reuben soon opened the door up to see what was the matter. The boy was twelve years of age and had a straw-colored shock of cow-licked hair and a freckled-face with ruddy cheeks.<br><br>"Well? What do you want?" grumbled the page, looking at Reuben's shirt, which was covered in the same filth as everything else in the village.<br><br>"Well, uh, nuthin', rightly," Reuben shrugged, "Thing is, sir, this here's me home."<br><br>"Then get inside it." The boy wasn't scared, and instead stood on his doorstep looking at the piece of paper.<br><br>"S'what's this, sir? A letter?" the boy asked.<br><br>"Read it and find out for yourself," the scribe said, growing angrier, though Reuben didn't seem to notice.<br><br>"Afear'd I can't, sir. Don't know how."<br><br>"What the devil's taking you, scribe?!" the lord hollered. He was still sitting in his carriage and hadn't heard the conversation. Clearly, he was growing bored.<br><br>"The whelp says he doesn't know how to read!"<br><br>"Aye, 'cause he don't," Reuben confirmed and took two steps toward the carriage, his bare feet sinking into the muddy gray muck.<br><br>"And the ones inside, do they?" questioned the lord.<br><br>"Where d'ye reckon they'd learn a thing like that, m'lord?" the peasant asked, perplexed, for he had always thought great lords like that must surely know everything.<br><br>"So who in your village does know how to read?" asked the lord, growing ever more irritated.<br><br>"Not no one, m'lord."<br><br>"Scribe," the lord said, leaning far out while leaning on his carriage door, "Could you explain to me how I am to enforce my declaration on people who do not know how to read and write?"<br><br>"I don't know, my lord," the scribe said, taking a step back, as if he expected the lord to jump out of the carriage and assault him. The fault was not his, but the lord was in the habit of beating his scribe when he grew angry, no matter the cause.
   1057791|5488a0b0||As is true of most realms, the predominant religion in the Skellige Isles has its roots in the prehistoric cult of the Great Mother, Mother Nature. On the Continent, such worship has taken as its object and namesake Melitele. In Skellige, her counterpart is Freya.<br>Like Melitele, Freya is represented in three aspects - virgin, mother and old crone. That of mother is most common, and sculptors chose to depict her thus in her greatest sanctuary in the Isles. There she stands, a pregnant woman draped in loose robes, her face partially revealed, her head bent and her hands folded across her breast. A golden necklace hangs around her neck, and on it a large, pure diamond (<i>Brisingamen</i>) shines like a clear summer sky.<br>Freyja Modron, or Freya the Great Mother, is the goddess of fertility, love, beauty and abundance. She is also the patron of oracles, soothsayers and telepaths. Warriors pray to her before setting out on sea raids, and the wives they leave behind pray to her for their husbands’ safe return. Only priestesses serve the goddess – men may worship Freya, but only women may do her work. Freya’s priestesses, like the clerics of other cults, treat mages and sorceresses with great reserve.<br>The center of Freya’s worship is her temple on the isle of Hindarsfjall, in the hallowed grove called Hindar. Worshippers place offerings to the goddess before her statue, on an altar that incorporates a great stone basin surrounded by figurines of cats and falcons - her sacred animals. In addition to this temple, sprinkled throughout the isles are other, smaller places where one can worship the goddess and make offerings to her (...).

My salary as a scribe was so laughably meager I was reduced to borrowing coin from my mother. I was a thief, but I also did a great deal of good for the palace library! Who secured the import of such tomes as <i>The Lives of the Prophets</i>, <i>De Haemorrhoidibus</i>, <i>The Art of Midwifery for Maidens</i> and many others? The palace library has me to thank for <i>The Storehouse of All Knowledge Needed for a Merry and Satisfied Life</i> and other rare tomes, such as <i>Speculum Aureum</i> and <i>De Larvis Scenicis Et Figuris Camicis</i>. Theft and embezzlement mean nothing. A man’s true value shows in the manner in which he treats books.

And I’ve plenty to write about, for the way we pillaged and plundered the Silver Salamander till it looked a pile of dank diarrhea was positively epic! Whole hanse had been fixing for ages to make a jaunt over to that tavern. For how long can you sit twiddling your thumbs at a place as foul as the ruins of Arthach? Water up to our ankles, fungus everywhere and the wind blowing so fierce our bums pucker. Why the dead-dong-diddle stick around? So we didn’t! We got our doodoo together and went to work! Hit them so hard, before they figured out what was going on, half of them had already been hacked apart! It was over in a flash. In fact, we got so carried away, not a living soul was to be seen when we were through, though it seems a few managed to scatter into the woods, including that blasted Nilfgaardian owner, but we’ll see to tracking down survivors later. Meanwhile, we’ll drink a bit, sing a bit, and then head out for a good hunt… So, there you go, my memoirs, signed me, vice-head of the hanse, Speedy Eugene.

   1061912|583570ac||A conviction has arisen amongst both mages and the hoi polloi that witchers barely rise a hair's breadth above animals, that they are deformed and bloodthirsty mutants, and that in slaking this thirst they do not limit themselves to the fluids of monsters. Meanwhile the research and observations of Virgil of Ban Ard paint an entirely different picture of the caste.<br><br>Of course, it is an indisputable fact that the mutations witchers undergo influence their temperament, immune system, strength and endurance, yet one cannot consider them unthinking beings forged only for killing as a result. In fact, witchers cultivate a unique culture, a specialized body of knowledge, an effective training system and even a code of honor. They know an incredible amount about the effects of ingesting various organic and inorganic substances, and also a small amount, but nevertheless something, about the fundamentals of magic (by which I mean the simple spells they call "Signs"). On the surface the witchers appear to be a homogeneous social entity, but in truth their fighting styles, training regimens and world views differ significantly depending upon the school to which they adhere. The best-known witcher schools on the Continent are the School of the Wolf, the School of the Bear, the School of the Griffin, the School of the Viper, and the School of the Cat.

   1208937|5857c32f||Before embarking on any consideration of the mutations undergone by witchers, let alone researching them, one should be aware of the specific physiology and biochemistry of these individuals. The transformations they experience during the Trial of the Grasses, which are widely considered to be irreversible, cause witchers to become infertile, while significantly increasing their physical strength and sharpening their senses. The processes also deprive witchers of emotions and human reflexes.<br><br>Although information about the Trial of the Grasses and other transformations to which young adepts of the witcher craft are subjected is strictly protected by master witchers and witcher sorcerers, Ludovic Cèlestin of Ban Ard claims the albumen of gray scolopendromorphs, the strain of giant centipede more commonly known as Pale Widows, constituted the basis of witcher mutagens. However, all research confirming this theory has been lost (…).

   1206165|58ec41db||Dear Gabriel,<br>As you are surely aware, in the wake of the count’s death, all responsibility for the care and management of Belgaard has fallen on me. In that capacity I turn to you for help, for you are both the best rhabdomancer in all the duchy and also a dear friend, so I pray you will not refuse me your services. Curious how your services might be needed by me in managing my vineyard? I shall soon tell you.<br><br>Before his death, Count Crespi ordered an extraordinary valuable batch of seedlings and if we do not plant them in the very near future, they shall all wither and perish. Sadly, the count left no record of where in the estate we are to prepare the ground for these seedlings. The geologist whom the count had summoned to show us the most fitting soil collected his (hefty) retainer, then disappeared. I would not be surprised to learn he was a common cheat. But let us get to the heart of the matter. I wish to ask you to use your rhabdomancical talents to locate where we should plant these valuable vines. I dare trust you shall take pity on an old friend and see to the task right away. Belgaard’s coffers are, it is true, empty, but I think I shall find a way to compensate you for your troubles.<br><br>Your Friend, Thierry Pires,<br><br>P.S.

   1073091|58f532dd||I'd always thought myself a simple trader, a man who buys here and sells there, and makes a bit of coin for himself in the doing. But yesterday I learned I constitute what's called a "strategic risk," and so cannot cross the bridge the Redanians control. Who knows what I have in my wagon, the sergeant said, maybe I'm smuggling weapons, maybe I'm carrying spies' reports? When I said they'd nothing to fear from my bundles of cloth and lace, and that the only letters I'm carrying are from my dear wife, the sergeant slapped me across the face with his glove and ordered me to, and I quote, "fuck off," or else I would soon "be seeing more stars than many an astronomer." As you can see, eloquence and good manners do not seem to be subjects of much importance at the Redanian officers' academy, though one must admit the soldier did display a certain amount of linguistic creativity.<br><br>Well, life goes on. I've hired a few mercenaries and a guide to help me ford across the river near the bridge. Once across, I'll blow that sergeant a kiss and continue on my way.

   1139591|58f7d13f||The elves are fond of saying, "We do not fear the well-known." Thus wild boars, being similar in appearance to domestic swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), are at times dismissed as harmless. For why should one cower before a furry pig when wyverns and manticores prowl the land?<br><br>The boar's appearances, however, are deceiving. Wild boars breathe no fire and carry no venom, true, but they have ushered many a hunter into the next life all the same. So that you may not share their fate, dear reader, read close the following.<br><br>Wild boars live in groups, called packs, of three to five individuals each. When aggravated, they will begin to circle their aggressor until, the moment being ripe, they charge. Wild boars then strike with heads as hard as battering rams and puncture with tusks aimed for the stomach or crotch.<br><br>Some try to slay the boar by approaching it from the rear, but I do not recommend this method: the beast will in such a case strike out its hind legs with such cruel force as to crush bone into dust. Better first to slow the boar with a trap, or, if one is learned in such rites, with a spell, and then try to fight using the power of the elements – for the beasts are particularly vulnerable to fire.

   1087439|595b28bc||5/20/1271<br><br>My Dear Gaspar,<br><br>We cannot rest on our laurels. True, we managed to convince the witcher to drink the concoction we had brewed without much difficulty, but now we must gather information. Somehow I doubt this Gerard, or whatever his name was, truly will truly keep an experiment diary, even if by some miracle he is literate. And without hard data, the Academy's governors will never renew our grant - believe me, I've been down that road before!<br><br>To keep one step ahead of events, I've already taken appropriate action. To be precise, while in Flotsam I hired a spy who will follow our witcher's every move and observe his deeds, especially those performed in the alcove. If our calculations are correct, within a year's time his sterility will be reversed - proof of which fact should come quickly in the form of expanding female bellies, if the rumors about him contain even a grain of truth.<br><br>The spy's wage is costly, true, but I'm convinced this investment will yield dividends. I believe a potion which restores the ability to reproduce to those who have lost it due to magic or alchemic experiments will be in high demand - and earn us a fortune.<br><br><i>Vivat Academia,</i><br>–Farid<br><br>P.S. Just remember - not a peep about this around the department, or the ethics committee will flay us alive.<br><br>P.P.S. I've received the spy's first report. The witcher is headed to Loc Muinne. Perhaps it's a good time to visit?

   1209937|5997f6a7||…Nowhere else in the entire world can one find better preserved relicts of the glory days of the Aen Seidhe. Naturally, by "the entire world," I in fact mean the areas that have entered man’s jurisdiction – Toussaint’s architecture obviously could not hold a candle to the wonders of Dol Blathanna. That is in no way meant to detract from the glory of the ruins of Termes, the old amphitheater or Arthach, the one-time summer residence to Toussaint's kings. More than any of these, however, it is the palace which captures one’s eye with its… [torn page]<br><br>…spacious terraces seemingly enclosed by openwork exedras with rows of intricate tracery and pinnacles crowned with spiked crockets. One may admire them through legions of ogival windows, the traceries of which are often decorated with the floral ornaments so typical for the culture of the Aen Seidhe. This style is especially prominent in its buttresses and niches.

Start the morning with baguette and camembert, then shuffle some parchments and head for home before dusk. Today, however, the normal order of things was disturbed – dramatically. I came across a highly interesting note in the archives. And, along with it, a key. The key is the more interesting find, because according to what I could decipher from the dust-covered scribblings on the note, it opens a chest full of gold coins! But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br><br>While doing some routine straightening of the files, I found a report outlining procedures for the reform of Bastoy Prison – orders straight from Duke Henri Gras. We all are aware how badly this experiment ended, for the ruins of that prison to this day frighten any potential “tourists” with their battered skeletons and legends about howling spirits of the murdered guards. Yet I did not know that hiding among the abandoned ruins there was a chest, and that its key was lying right under my nose! The chest supposedly contains crowns meant for the purchase of books and rations for the inmates of Bastoy. One of the clerks employed here at the time committed a sin of omission and sent the chest to the warden without the key. Yet perhaps that was for the best? The warden was impaled and the guards all skinned alive, meaning those degenerates would have also got their hands on the chest, had he received the key. As it is – might the chest still be there, unopened?<br><br>Folk say a curse has fallen on that place, a dark power brought down by the bestiality of the murders it beheld, but folk also say an Ofieri will become emperor of Nilfgaard and herald the end of the world, so there’s not much point giving any of such jabbering much credence.

I turned to the best weapon in my arsenal—the quill and the well-turned phrase—and began writing  you this letter (forgive me, it is written on a napkin, for I had nothing more appropriate at hand at the time). O, most marvelous of all women, do not believe a word he whispers in your ear – he is as slippery as a viper and twice as venomous!

   1057887|5d875152||Clan Tuirseach, master of An Skellig, was founded by a hero named Tyr. Legend has it that to take possession of the land promised him by Hemdall, his father, Tyr first had to defeat a great and powerful bear named Yngvar. It was well known that no mortal had ever survived an encounter with Yngvar, so Tyr decided to prepare properly for the fight. He ventured into the deepest cave in Skellige and with the fire of the bowels of the earth as his furnace, he forged a blade so fine it could slice a hair lengthwise and so strong it could fell a hundred-year-old tree in one blow and not be dulled. Heulyn, his mother, engraved protective runes upon the sword by the first light of dawn so that it would protect Tyr from the bear’s attacks. Yngvar was defeated, Tyr became master of An Skellig, and his descendants are one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in the Isles to this day.

   1063666|5ddb4060||None of the four Planes or Dimensions - those of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air - is accessible to mere mortals. They are inhabited, however, by creatures known as genies. There are four types, each corresponding to one of the four Elements which comprise their respective essences. Each type of genie also counts its antithesis among the others. Thus, the marides, aligned with the Element of Water, are opposed by the fiery ifrits. The Plane of Earth is inhabited by the d'ao genies, and the Dimension of Air which opposes it is home for d'jinni - whose name, incidentally, is the root of the word genie. This last term is often used by simple folk to refer to all creatures that inhabit the Elemental Planes, which is an obvious blunder…<br><br>Unusually powerful sorcerers can sometimes bind such beings and bend them to their will, thus acquiring tremendous might to the point of near omnipotence. For a genie, being the living personification of an Element's energies, is akin to an almost boundless reservoir of the Power. Thus, its master can draw energy from the genie for spell casting, without the tiresome need to channel from traditional sources. However, those who are able to bind a genie are few and far between, for the strength of the inhabitants of the four Planes is matched only by the cunning which they employ to avoid such a fate.

But I promise you, I swear on all the gods: everything which you shall read in the pages to follow is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<br><br>I met the vampire of which I write years ago, in an inn in Beauclair. He introduced himself to me as Regis and said he was a barber and a medic. Since he looked in every aspect like a mortal man, I might never have even suspected his true nature - had not a fire broken out shortly thereafter in the establishment in which we were residing. This Regis, if that truly was his name, stood completely untouched by the flames, whereas my own clothing quickly caught fire. The vampire carried me out of the burning inn, saving my life from certain death, then treated my numerous wounds.<br><br>At first Regis refused to answer my query as to how he had miraculously survived the furnace-like temperatures inside the burning inn without so much as a scratch on his body or a hair singed on his head. Eventually, however, he must have sensed I was a man of the world, one who would not jump to hasty judgments based on appearance or species, and revealed his identity - along with a great number of highly interesting facts.<br><br>According to Regis, not all vampires are alike. This vast family contains both mindless katakans, fleders and ekimmaras, who in form resemble overgrown bats far more than humans, as well as alps and bruxae, who look remarkably like comely maids. In addition to these, there are the even more powerful higher vampires, to which genus belonged my unexpected acquaintance.<br><br>Not even a witcher can discern a higher vampire from a mortal man. Contrary to popular belief, they cannot be killed by pounding aspen stakes into their chests nor by cutting off their heads, nor, as I can vouch for based on personal experience, by fire. They do not fear running water, garlic or the symbols of any creed. It might be some consolation to learn a vampire's bite does not turn a human into one of their number, and they do not in any way need our blood in order to survive - to them, it is merely a delicacy in which they indulge from time to time, like men do with fine wine.<br><br>Regis asked me to keep his tale to myself. But now, as I lay on my death bed, I feel that I must share this secret knowledge, even if it means breaking my word to this most noble individual...

   1063670|5f9018ff||Among the many creatures of our world there are but two that are able to draw and absorb the Power, and these are cats and dragons. Both species instinctively sense the presence of magic intersections and often choose them as resting places, which is strange, for other animals avoid these same spots. Numerous theories attempt to explain this behavior, but none do so with thorough success. Some scholars claim dragons use the Power they imbibe to fly - for as the natural philosophers have proven, no creature of their size and mass should be capable of lifting itself into the air using such meager wings.<br><br>As for cats, there is a theory stating the Power is behind their gift for seeing things in complete darkness. Others claim this ability is theirs by nature, and they use the Power of the intersections for other, unknown purposes. Indeed, that all members of the felidae genus are able to see beings from other planes, invisible persons and emanations of the Power has been proven beyond any doubt on numerous occasions.

There’s still a week till you’re to wed the Ofieri. I’ll think of something. Perhaps I’ll get the coin by then, perhaps my tears will convince your father, perhaps the gods will hear our prayers – or if not they, perhaps some devil will. If nothing else helps, I’ll crash into the temple through the window and swoop you up from the altar. We’ll flee somewhere far, far away, to the edge of the world, where no one will find us.<br><br>You write of sadness. I feel its weight, too. I think of you constantly. Of how we sat at the Alchemy till dawn nursing a bottle of wine, and you traced our dream house in the sawdust on the floor. Of how we dangled our feet in the water from the dock and you sang those bawdy songs and made me laugh and laugh. I kiss the medallion carrying your portrait before I fall asleep and as soon as I wake.<br><br>I swear on all that is holy: we shall be together forever. Be brave.<br><br>I Love You!<br>-Your O.

   1076506|5fd99527||Twenty years of service have taught me this: never trust the equipment given to you by your quartermaster. Army smiths and armorers do everything en masse - meaning they do a shoddy job of it. They throw any old shite into the alloy, so their swords come out brittle and worthless. They throw helmets together without a second thought, so they fall apart when the first blow hits your head. No solid oak ever makes it into their shields - instead they hew them out of pine that arrows pierce through like butter.<br><br>Can anyone tell me why that's allowed? How a general can let his soldiers go to battle with such weapons in hand? How he expects to win a war with such weapons?<br><br>The truth is, most soldiers die during the first clash of armies, even if they're wielding a Mahakam-forged blade and clad in Nilfgaardian plate. In short, no point wasting coin on them. And those that survive either grab better kit off of corpses or requisition some from travelers.<br><br>Cruel? Perhaps. But true. So listen up, recruit: the sword they give you during training's fit at best to use as a toothpick. And the helmet - as a bedpan.

   1152362|60016d66||7 Feainn 1203<br>The attacks have grown more forceful. The residents of the nearby village who oppose my presence become more aggressive by the day. They do not like that I speak the truth about their former deities. They cannot understand they will only find salvation in Lebioda. They threaten me with death, but if I am to die for Lebioda, if that is the destiny the Prophet has marked out for me, I shall fulfill it with a broad smile on my face.<br><br>14 Feainn 1203<br>I have just parted with a most marvelous guest, a true convert, a man of extraordinary yearning for truth and faith. He is called Merten and was once a witcher but has abandoned that dishonorable trade and embarked on the path of truth. We spoke at length and sat together for hours in meditation and prayer. To better honor Lebioda he left behind here many goods which symbolized his attachment to his former life. He has made great progress – oh, If only all the disciples of Lebioda were so fervent in their faith, this world would be a better place!<br><br>Merten confessed to me the bitter truth about the foul deeds he had wrought in his past life. I told him if he is to obtain cleansing, he must go to the Hidden Chapel. Reaching this bleak place, which is carved out of rock and ridden with dangerous creatures, will in itself constitute a challenge and a trial – if Lebioda lets him enter the chapel’s confines, it means he has forgiven his sins, his crimes. And so Merten went… Let Lebioda guide his feet.<br><br>19 Feainn 1203<br>My fate is sealed. I shall die for my faith, for truth, for Lebioda. This night folk from the village, a band of drunken thugs, attacked the temple. With hate and malice on their breath they cried that since I am the Great Beggar, I should now beg Lebioda for mercy. They looted the temple of all its treasures (thankfully leaving the books, which they deemed worthless) and walled me in to wither in a sealed tomb... If Lebioda does not send me help, I will die here. May my bones bear witness to his glory.

   1080375|60875858||Before we sink our teeth, so to speak, into our analysis of the katakan, the creature to whom the present work is dedicated, by way of introduction let me present to our less-experienced readers what exactly vampires are - and what they are not. To our great displeasure, a great many myths concerning these creatures have arisen over the years, and the popular tales about them have served only to make popular superstitions and falsehoods.<br><br>In the common folk's imagination, vampires are dead men and women arisen from their graves, wraiths driven by an unquenchable thirst for warm blood. Yet nothing could be further from the truth! These creatures first came to be on another world, arrived in ours centuries ago and have since learned to live among men and have evolved at our side.<br><br>The widespread belief that vampires must drink human blood in order to survive is flat-out wrong, though they do in fact often partake of our vital fluid, for human blood affects their physiology as alcohol does ours. A vampire's bite does not turn its victim into a vampire, a state of affairs which would in fact be counter to logic, for it would mean the world would soon fill with vampires as they multiply at an exponential rate. Running water presents no barrier to vampires, not even if it is cold, for vampires are immune to the forces of both heat and cold.<br><br>Now for the most important matter: vampires have learned to live in the light of our sun, which is not harmful to them in the least, though they absolutely never shimmer or glisten when struck with the sun's rays.

   1206322|60cff59d||Gwent: for many a diverting game of cards, for others, a noble pursuit, for some – a crippling addiction which devours their every coin and every waking moment. These last can be found most frequently among the dwarves, the game’s inventors and most passionate devotees. Their devotion extends to gwent’s paraphernalia, its cards most of all, which they craft with great care and skill - in fact, cards painted by dwarven masters are often considered miniature works of art. In past times they devoted equal attention to whittling the clubs which contestants once kept at their sides, to bash each other about the head with in the case of an argument. As brawls grew less common, the clubs became implied threats more than used weapons, until eventually falling into disuse and near oblivion.<br><br>Today gwent players can be found almost everywhere, from the Skellige Isles (where the game was introduced by the druid Ermion) to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br><br>In gwent, the play of cards mimics the dueling of two armies. The playing field is divided into two parts, each split into three rows. Nearest to the center stand units who fight at close quarters, behind them, archers and other such ranged attackers, and furthest back, machines and creatures used for siege purposes. Both players wield decks made up of a minimum of 22 unit cards and a maximum of 10 special cards, and each must also contain a leader card. The player who wins the toss of a coin (originally: the dwarf whose wife has the longest beard) plays first. Each player draws at random 10 cards from his deck and then is allowed to redraw 2 of these before the laying of cards begins. Each round is won by the player who has played cards of the greatest value. The first to achieve 2 victorious rounds wins, meaning a maximum of 3 rounds are played. The winner’s prize is agreed upon by the players before each match – most often, the wager is a bounty of coin or a rare card<br><br>The heart of the players’ armies, the unit cards, come in three types:<br>close combat units,<br>ranged combat units,<br>siege units.<br><br>Each such card is assigned a strength rating and may additionally possess special abilities.<br><br>There are also special cards which have no strength rating but instead influence the course of the game in other ways.<br><br>Unit cards depicting famed heroes not only have unusually high strength ratings, but also have the added benefit of ignoring the workings of all special cards. These are the rarest and most coveted of gwent cards. Most frequently they must be won from top players or purchased at a great price from collectors. <br><br>The cards in classic gwent are divided into four factions:<br>The Northern Realms, leader: Foltest<br>The Nilfgaardian Empire, leader: Emhyr var Emreis <br>Monsters, leader: Eredin Bréacc Glas<br>The Scoia'tael, leader: Francesca Findabair.

   1057788|612902ce||Magic is the science of harnessing, subduing and making use of the power of the elements. It is also an incarnation of Chaos, which is why no one without proper training should ever dabble in any of its domains. Expert mages make of magic an art, but the road to virtuosity leads through years of practice, study, and hard work - and requires a considerable amount of required inborn talent. Magic was implanted in our world through the Conjunction of the Spheres, and was discovered to be a living, changeable and controllable being shortly thereafter. The name of the first mage, the one who first discovered this talent within himself and grappled with its power, is unknown. We do know, however, that in a relatively short period of time after the discovery of magic groups began to form in which talented beings could work together on developing their abilities. This period is usually considered the beginning of magic as a science, and these groups – the prototypes of magic schools.<br>The fundamental planes from which one might draw magic power are: earth, water, air and fire. In the tome which you currently hold, each of these will have a separate chapter dedicated to it, ordered according to the level of difficulty and danger associated with the element discussed (…).

   1061827|6144a12a||I was at Loc Muinne - that’s right, the summit of summits itself. We’d gone there, my troupe mates and I, knowing there’d be a meeting of the mighty in the ruins. You see, whenever big shots gather to chew some particularly gristly fat, there’s coin to be had for performing men like us - tired jaws need to relax with some laughing and indulging in other sorts of simple delights. I learned this as a lad from my old man, who’d drag me around to juggle outside courts and conventions all over the Continent. And so now, plying my own trade as a fire swallower, I told the lads up soon as I caught word of what was brewing in Loc Muinne and we turned our wagons thataway at once.<br><br>I’m not much one for politics, but I couldn’t help but listen to some of it this time - you see, we Temerians had just lost our king, and our future was to be decided at that very summit, with John Natalis representing our side of the matter. Radovid was there, too, a young pup then, though emanating strength like a grey-haired alpha wolf. It seemed this wolf was licking his chops over Temeria like it was a ripe bit of carrion…<br><br>The rest was dull - a lot of talk about the uprising in Aedirn and its leader, Saskia, who they called the Virgin - though I never got the chance to check personally whether that was accurate. The Nilfgaardians had a delegate, some Shilard fellow, and mages were there, talking about restoring the Conclave and Supreme Council of Sorcerers.<br><br>I didn’t listen to much of that - my eyes were glued to the unusually large number of armed troops present at these “peaceful” talks. Steel-plated grunts clenched pointy weapons and paced the ruins’ courtyards everywhere you looked. Radovid had even brought the knightly Order of the Flaming Rose, those arrogant pricks ready to bash anyone who doesn’t think the same as them. Though the coin was coming in amply, we didn’t wait around to see how things would develop, just loaded our stuff onto our wagon and left at a trot. As we mounted the pass, we looked back to see pillars of smoke, black as pitch, rising above Loc Muinne…

Then sail to Undvik, climb the mountain and walk the ridge. Bow once to each of the four winds, commend yourself to the gods and toss the chest into the sea."<br><br>Holvarg did as the druid counseled, then returned to the Sacred Grove. "I tossed the chest in the sea," Holvarg said. "But I don't feel one bit wiser." The druid replied, "That is because there are no shortcuts on the road to wisdom. Neither saying prayers nor making offerings nor listening to the words of wisemen will grant it to you. That is your lesson.” Hearing this, Holvarg flew into a rage and strangled the druid with his bare hands, then stuck his head on a pike and set it out in front of his house, so everyone would know that, while he might not be wise, he was nobody's fool.

   1109257|6259f0ec||My study of Elgar's armor has allowed me to devise new alloys and increase the magic conductivity of the second crystal. This might be the breakthrough I needed in my work on the teleport. For my trial run, I have calibrated the portal to exit in the cave near the tower's base. I need now only charge the crystal with solar energy, for which purpose I have placed it in the outer wall of the tower, near the scaffolding. Only hours remain before it is entirely charged!<br><br>I have finished my work on a diagram which will allow us to replicate this armor and equip the entire School of the Wolf with it. Varin, the witchers' fencing instructor, has taken credit for this find, but it was I who, using logical deduction and only a slight dollop of magic assistance, uncovered the chamber where Elgar must have once resided. The space was hidden behind a primitive illusion, one needed merely look carefully to see through it. I found notes which indicate Elgar had worked out diagrams for improvements to his equipment which he then hid for safekeeping in various locations around the world. Careful study of his notes allowed me to write up instructions on how to find these upgrades. I went to the old watchtower and gave this research to Chird. As soon as he finishes preparing the silver sword diagram, he will set out to gather all the upgrade diagrams. Varin has the finished steel sword diagram and will begin forging blades based on it. I hope he will distribute them to the poor lads he trains - they at least deserve proper equipment after going through the horror he calls training.<br><br>By the gods - I think I see fire on the horizon, coming from where the old watchtower stands! I can also hear some kind of commotion outside my tower.<br><br>The way down is blocked - what is going on?!

I know there's much we both wish to say, but there will come a time for that later. In any case, a letter is no place to broach topics of such importance to us both.<br><br>So, why I write you now: you have something waiting for you at the royal palace in Vizima. Consider it a gift from Emhyr and myself. You can pick it up at your leisure after your audience with him. When you exit the throne room, simply follow the covered walkway in the courtyard, turning right at the corner, then take the first door on your left. You'll be inside a chamber with a fireplace. Take the door in the back right to the adjoining room. There, under the window, you'll find the chest with your gift. But in case these directions prove too complicated for you, I'm certain the chamberlain would not hesitate to lead you there himself. Expert tracker that you are, however, I expect you'll manage.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer

   1077697|630b75e9||Dearest Sir Robert de Mere,<br><br>Thank you for sending a bill of exchange in advance, and for your understanding - if I gave out advice for free, I'd very quickly run myself out of business.<br><br>You wrote that your son went missing while on a voyage - and that near the place where he was last seen there now lurks a nekker who wears a tattered shirt with your son's monogram sewed on it. You asked if it is possible that this nekker was your son, transformed by some spell.<br><br>After consulting the relevant literature, it pains me to inform you that your hypothesis is highly improbable, and there exists a much simpler and more likely explanation. Contrary to popular belief, nekkers are a sapient species. Like forest trolls, they will at times decorate themselves with pigment or scraps of human garments. One can with some confidence surmise that this nekker killed your son, tore up his shirt, then donned it or some fragment thereof.<br><br>While that is most likely the case, one cannot be certain. Though I have not heard of any curse capable of turning a man into a nekker, I cannot rule out the possibility of its existence. In order to find out if the above-mentioned nekker truly is a creature born of a curse, the tattered shirt it wears must be taken from it, cut into shreds and burned. The shirt's ashes can then be mixed with dimeritium dust. If the resulting substance changes color, it will confirm your hypothesis.<br><br>If the experiment I described returns a positive result, please write me. I would gladly undertake further examinations meant to find a way to lift this curse - for additional payment, of course.<br><br>Greetings,<br><br>Klaus Kellerman, <i>Magister Artibus Oxoniensis</i>

   1087432|635bc6da||Once-prospering Undvik was the second (after Ard Skellig) most-frequently visited isle in the archipelago. Among its ample charms are a prime location, picturesque scenery and a sublime local cuisine. Sadly the isle was recently devastated when some monstrous frosty giant awoke from his long slumber and began murdering and destroying whatever lay at hand.<br><br>After this occurrence many realms issued an official edict of warning cautioning their residents to avoid travel to Undvik. Nevertheless, the isle still attracts many travelers. They are no longer primarily lovers of carefree relaxation, however. Instead they are adventure seekers and mercenaries hoping to earn the bounty put on the giant's head, or, barring that, at least get a glimpse of this fantastic creature with their own eyes.<br><br>Though this is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness such a sight, we are duty-bound to advise anyone thinking of visiting Undvik to postpone their trip until conditions improve, or, even better, alter their plans and visit one of Skellige's many other attractive isles, where the risk of being disemboweled by a colossal man-beast is significantly lower.

That (with all due disrespect) pot-bellied swine?! Over me?! I do not know if you have been testing new concoctions that have addled your mind or if perhaps this is another one of your games... yet even if you must seek intimacy with that primitive for political reasons, I do not see why this should mean the end of our relationship.

Sadly, he did not fulfill his oath and instead plummeted to his doom after a few paces. Cunigunde, his beautiful daughter, swore that day she would only marry the man who could finish her father’s deed. Many a stripling lad lost his life attempting to fulfill that comely maid’s cruel condition. When finally one succeeded, he surveyed the carnage she had wrought and decided she was unworthy of his affections. Realizing with despair how despicably she had acted, Cunigunde threw herself from the castle walls, dying smashed against the rocks below like so many of her unfortunate suitors.

   1202558|66d7c743||In my capacity as a scholar at the Imperial Academy, I have spent the better part of the last two decades studying ancient elven culture. My most recent research bears the working title "The Influence of Ancient Elven Architecture on Human Structures." I am aware the Caroberta Woods have been classified as extremely dangerous by the Ducal Guard, but to a true scholar, the quest for knowledge is what matters most, more than even life itself. That is why I seek a local hunter or knight to be my guide and guard. Serious offers only.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Johan Neskens
   1206866|66e3d97a||Dear Diary,<br>It’s been three weeks since Lady Orianna took me off the street. At last I've something to eat and drink and play with other children every day. It’s even better than at home, for at home there rarely was anything to eat and when mummy died, there was never anything at all.<br><br>Today I played with Miri and Tomm – first we played Duck, duck, goose, then hide and seek, then pick-a-stick. Then we played tag. I had a lot of fun! Then a cart from Lady Orianna came and there was lots of food. There were sweet rolls, fruit and cake, and many other tasty things. Lady Orianna is the best!<br><br>Lady Orianna visited us early in the morning. First she talked with us, then she sang to us, and then she took Johnny to the other room. We were all jealous of him. When he came back, he was a little pale and had small red marks on his neck, but he also had a huuuge bag of chocolates! Miri says sometimes Lady Orianna takes a child and does something to them, I didn’t really understand what, but then they get a gift from her. I hope next time she takes me!<br><br>Today’s rainy and I’m really bored. Tomm said I’m stupid, but I don’t believe him because he's stupid, too. Maybe Lady Orianna will come tomorrow and I’ll get a gift from her. That will show him!<br><br>She chose me! Lady Orianna came and chose me! I went to the other room with her, she told me to show her my neck, and then she kind of bit me. It didn’t really hurt, I just felt dizzy later. But that’s not important because she gave me a wooden sword! Nobody has one like that! Tomm will be so jealous!

   1078096|670f1bcc||Last week the three of us grabbed this traveler. Looked like the kind of cowardly fuck starts shitting his breeches at the first sight of you. But seems looks can be deceiving. Bastard started waving a sword, cut my ear off and sliced Olaf's arse so deep he's got an extra crack, except the new one's horizontal. Then he smacked Ivar in the forehead with the hilt. Poor sod's still dizzy.<br><br>We snuffed him in the end, of course - every fellow's doomed when he's outnumbered. But it turned out he had a handful of coins in his pouch, a copper ring on his finger - and that's it. We lost out on that robbery - paid more to the herbalist for patching up than we took from the whoreson. So afterwards Olaf said, "Why the devil risk our necks waiting around for travelers, when gold's literally sitting right under our feet - buried with the dead?" A corpse can't defend itself, so the risk of injury's nil. No need to wait around all day till someone walks by - there's already a couple dozen someone's waiting for us, lying in their graves, each one marked out like veg at a grocer's.<br><br>So I gave it a good think and concluded Olaf's talking sense. So starting tomorrow we're going to stay off the roads and do our looting in the graveyard instead.

   1208765|692756d4||…For those who find the wines of the Sansretour Valley too dull, I strongly recommend the lesser-known but still outstanding brands produced in the Blessure Valley. Let us start with the amazing Côte-de-Blessure, produced at the Pomerol vineyard. I particularly recommend the 1260-1263 vintages, with their distinctively rich flavor. Looking elsewhere, the nearby Zurbarrán castle offers the dry Castel de Neuf, whereas Nuragus and Sancerre, located in the northern parts of Toussaint, specialize in red wines and, jointly, produce and export the wine known in the North as Toussaint Red. Exquisite rosé wine could once be found at Casteldaccia, but ever since its owner tragically passed away, the vineyard has fallen into decay…

   1206329|697538a8||... so I say to that, “Minister Tremblay, the whole Sansretour Valley is overrated! Those wines, why, don’t get me started on Est Est - ever since they started mass-producing it, they should call it Était Était, for it's definitely seen better days.” Then he says, “Right you are, always been a Côte-de-Blessure chap myself. In fact, between you and me, I even prefer it to Sangreal” -  you know, the wine reserved for Her Illustrious Highness and her inner circle.<br><br>And then, the fool I am, I blurt out, “Oh, I agree, whenever Her Grace has me taste it, I’ve got to swill my mouth out with vodka afterwards, to wash out that rancid taste.” Oh, come on, I was drunk, wasn’t I? Talking out of my bum. Well, turns out I had rather overvalued my position at court. Tremblay needed but say a word in the duchess' ear and, in three shakes of a donkey's tail, I was out on the street. The job of ducal taster’s been given back to Benoit – can you believe it? After that scandal involving Baronesses Nique and Queline? As for me – well, what was I supposed to do? Had no choice but to start making and drinking my own brews – that’s always been my true passion.

   1154902|698eff24||Sir Gareth and Miss Daphne loved each other so much it hurt. To win the approval of his future father-in-law, Gareth had to perform seven challenges.[...]<br><br>The seventh was the hardest. Gareth had to go to Lynx Crag, find the witch who lives there and convince her to lift the drought that plagued the whole land. Everyone, including Daphne, pleaded with Gareth to humble himself before the witch. You see, the witch from Lynx Crag was spiteful and headstrong, even for a witch, and only an act of true humility could break her icy heart.<br><br>Gareth, however, had no intention of bending his knee before a witch. Instead, he planned to force her to lift the curse. Nobody knows what happened on Lynx Crag, but Gareth never returned to his beloved. Daphne stood on the top of a hill and looked for him day and night. Finally, she turned into a tree, so that she may live to see the return of her knight. Such was the strength of her longing and the power of her love.<br><br>Anyone who plunged his axe blade into that tree would see blood run from the wound. Folk started to avoid that place, leaving Daphne in peace to wait for Gareth. In time, all had forgotten about her.
   1075847|698f28f6||Gunnar,<br><br>You don't go climbing to the top of that tower, you hear? Don't try to be a hero, no one's gonna sing about a bunch of bandits anyhow.<br><br>I heard there's a witcher snooping around the isles. I'll try to get him to take care of it. We'll figure out how to settle his bill once he's done. A dagger between the ribs, that sounds like fair pay. Till then - sit on your arse and wait. And if the howling gets to you at night - stick something in your ears.<br><br>--Kvegg.

   1058749|69bf4792||Kovir and Poviss are without a doubt the richest realms in the North. Few today remember that this was not always the case, yet their poverty was once literally on everyone’s lips, in the form of now-antiquated common sayings. As recently as in the days of Heribert the Quarrelsome, one spoke of a particularly impoverished person as being “poorer than a mouse from Poviss,” called bone broth “Koviri delight” and referred to beggars as “praxedes,” after the bay along the shores of which these kingdoms lie.<br><br>Similarly, few remember that a mere handful of generations ago Kovir and Poviss were still a part of Redania. King Radovid I, known as Radovid the Great, handed dominion over them to his hated brother, Troyden, with one stipulation - that he never leave his newly-acquired demesne and not interfere in matters of state.<br><br>Handing over this rocky scrap of far-northern ground (where, the saying went, the year had two seasons - August and winter) was naturally meant as a cruel joke, a slap in the face for the over-ambitious Troyden.<br><br>Yet time soon proved that Radovid the Great had made a grave error. Before long it was discovered that Kovir's bare rocks hid priceless treasure in the form of enormous deposits of precious metals and rock salt. This discovery in turn led to tremendous growth in productive industry. Mills, forges and workshops sprouted up like mushrooms after a hearty rain.<br><br>Radovid III decided to correct his famous forebear's mistake and take back the northern frontiers of his kingdom. He was convinced the combined armies of Redania and its then-ally Kaedwen would quickly bring this ever more audacious vassal in line. History took a different turn, however, and Kovir won a resounding, crushing victory. Radovid III was forced to sign the First Treaty of Lan Exeter, granting Kovir independence while binding it to eternal neutrality - a promise Troyden’s successors have kept with great diligence.<br><br>Until recently Kovir was ruled by Esterad Thyssen, a king as wise as he was greedy. Yet his untimely demise did not stop his lands from continuing to develop and blossom. Koviri metallurgists proudly compete with the best Mahakam can offer, and many believe the University of Lan Exeter long ago surpassed the famous Oxenfurt Academy as the leading seat of higher learning in the North. And so it has come to pass that, over the course of a few generations, the inhabitants of Kovir and Poviss have turned from paupers into princes, from beggars into bankers.

   1135709|6a7c522a||It is hard to say anything about Zuetzer Castle without mentioning the tragic death of Anastasia von Bourmann. Once one of the most powerful magnates in Redania, Count von Bourmann retreated from public life after the loss of his only child and never left his family manor to the very end of his days. Currently Zuetzer Castle is but a decaying ruin haunted by a sad past.

   1077568|6ad3ffa9||Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made three daughters out of dirt and water.<br><br>A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of Velen. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, Velen was drowning in blood.<br><br>The daughters saw their land nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night of sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her in the bog. Her blood watered the oak atop Ard Cerbin, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land and so the sisters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the Whispering Hillock, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.

I’ve finally found a way to end this deadly little charade she’s put on. The key to unraveling the riddle lay in a dusty old tome in my library. That little vipress was marked by a leshen! That is why the monster attacked my castle. There was only one way out of this situation…<br><br>I snuck up while she slept and throttled her. She didn't even manage to peep. Now I can finally leave my castle walls, thank the gods. The monstrosity has skirted off into oblivion along with that accursed child. That entire affair was a horrific error. I’m just glad the savings from previous missions are safely preserved in the castle treasury. I must recruit some mage, perhaps that will ensure I avoid such incidents in the future.

   1085697|6d1ad38c||To Fast Travel, you must first find a signpost. You can only Fast Travel to signposts you have already discovered.
   1085698|6d1ad38d||You have only a limited time to make some dialogue choices. Choose quickly, or else chance will decide for you.
   1085699|6d1ad38e||When traveling, it's safer to stick to the beaten path - but the wilds hide much that is worth exploring.
   1085700|6d1ad38f||Keep an eye on your horse's fear level. If it panics, it will buck you off and bolt. You can calm your horse using the Axii Sign.
   1085701|6d1ad3a5||Specialized witcher equipment sets are better than common weapons or armor.
   1085702|6d1ad3a6||Sharpening your blade on a grindstone will cause it to deal more damage.
   1085703|6d1ad3a7||You can find rare herbs and hidden treasure underwater.
   1085705|6d1ad3a8||While underwater, you cannot fight or cast Signs, but you can use your crossbow.
   1085719|6d1ad3a9||Humans don't trust nonhumans. Racial tensions in cities where they cohabit often explode in pogroms and massacres.
   1085706|6d1ad3aa||If you want to craft a weapon or piece of equipment, you need to find a crafting diagram and gather the required ingredients. Then take these to a craftsman.
   1085707|6d1ad3ab||Certain Abilities can change how your Signs function.
   1085708|6d1ad3ac||Mount strong attacks against armored opponents and fast attacks against swift ones.
   1085709|6d1ad3ad||If an enemy protects himself with a shield, try to strike him from behind or with the Aard Sign.
   1085710|6d1ad3ae||When you draw on a Place of Power, you receive an additional Ability Point. Places of Power can be found all over the world.
   1085711|6d1ad3c4||Temerian orens and Nilfgaardian florens can be exchanged for Novigrad crowns at the Vivaldi Bank in Novigrad.
   1085712|6d1ad3c5||Drowners become more powerful at night and during heavy rainstorms.
   1085713|6d1ad3c6||All tutorial messages are saved in the glossary.
   1085715|6d1ad3c7||To use an Ability, you first must acquire it and place it in one of the slots on the right side of the Character Panel.
   1085716|6d1ad3c8||Mutagens gathered from monster bodies can be used to brew powerful decoctions or added to your Abilities to grant a special bonus.
   1085722|6d1ad3c9||You're free to wander, but might happen across some very powerful foes while doing so. Return to them once you've gained more experience.
   1085723|6d1ad3ca||Look for boats along the coast and near harbors.
   1085724|6d1ad3cb||Pay attention to the color of your enemies' level numbers. Green means they are close to your level. Red means they are a challenge, and a skull icon means certain death.
   1085725|6d1ad3cc||Dodging is usually the best tactic when fighting monsters. When fighting humans, try to parry their attacks with your sword.
   1085726|6d1ad3cd||Try to use a combination of fast attacks, strong attacks and Signs.
   1085727|6d1ad3e3||Some offensive Abilities can be successfully used for defense as well.
   1085728|6d1ad3e4||When throwing a bomb or shooting a bolt from your crossbow, you can either take advantage of auto-aiming for a quick attack, or aim manually for more precision.
   1085729|6d1ad3e5||Some weapons do more than just deal damage - for example, they can stun opponents or cause them to begin bleeding profusely.
   1085730|6d1ad3e6||Vitality regenerates when you eat. On lower difficulty levels, it also regenerates during Meditation.

   1085733|6d1ad3e9||Many believe in Ithlinne's Prophecy, which states that the world will be destroyed by the White Frost.
   1085734|6d1ad3ea||The Empire of Nilfgaard has already conquered many kingdoms in its drive to expand and is currently waging its third major war against the Northern Realms.
   1085735|6d1ad3eb||The witcher caste was created centuries ago, when men first began colonizing a world filled with monsters and countless other dangers. Currently no witcher school trains new witchers.
   1085736|6d1ad3ec||A witcher's senses are superhumanly sensitive. By focusing them, Geralt can find tracks no normal man would ever see.
   1085737|6d1ad402||Witcher potions are deadly to ordinary folk.
   1085738|6d1ad403||Witchers are immune to contagious disease and resist the harmful effects of poison better than normal men.
   1085739|6d1ad404||Witchers, like sorceresses, are infertile.

   1091364|6d1ad40b||Groups of outlaws sometimes keep hostages in their camps. Defeat the bandits and free their prisoners to gain access to additional craftsmen and merchants.
   1091365|6d1ad421||Develop the Axii Sign to unlock access to additional dialogue options.
   1091372|6d1ad422||With witcher gear, crafting it is only the first step - each item can also be upgraded.
   1091373|6d1ad423||Nearly all potions, bombs and oils can be upgraded.
   1091378|6d1ad424||Whetstones and armorer's tools let you repair your items without having to visit a craftsman.
   1091385|6d1ad425||The Swallow potion regenerates Vitality both during and outside of combat.
   1091386|6d1ad426||A torch can help lighten the gloom of the world's murky places. The Cat potion is also useful in this regard - it allows you to see in even pitch blackness.
   1091387|6d1ad427||Strike an opponent while riding towards him at high speed for a possible instant kill.
   1091388|6d1ad428||While journeying by boat, you have the ability to Fast Travel. Open the World Map and select a harbor to move directly to that location.
   1091389|6d1ad429||Some merchants deal in rare goods, including mysterious maps covered in markings which seem to indicate hidden stashes of witcher gear diagrams.
   1091390|6d1ad42a||Skellige merchants sell maps of the archipelago's individual isles. These maps unlock Fast Travel to certain signposts on these isles - even ones you haven't already visited.
   1091391|6d1ad440||Most elements of witcher gear have three upgrade levels. Each upgrade changes the equipment's appearance and traits.
   1091392|6d1ad441||In the Options menu, you can choose whether tracks and clues uncovered using your Witcher Senses will be shown on the minimap.
   1091393|6d1ad442||In the Options menu, you can choose whether the route to your current objective will be shown on the minimap.
   1091394|6d1ad443||In the Options menu, you can configure most of the elements of the game's interface.
   1091395|6d1ad444||Each item adds to the weight you are carrying, so manage your inventory wisely. You can increase the amount you can carry by fitting your horse with better saddlebags.
   1091435|6d1ad445||Better equipment for your horse can be won in horse races or found scattered throughout the world.
   1091436|6d1ad446||If you want to dive to great depths - for example, to find treasure hidden in an underwater ravine - you can drink the Killer Whale potion beforehand. Killer Whale lets you hold your breath for a longer period of time.
   1091437|6d1ad447||You can acquire a special Ability that will allow you to deflect incoming bolts and arrows.
   1091438|6d1ad448||Don't upset the guards. If provoked, they'll try bring you to order by force, then take some of your coin as a fine for causing trouble.
   1091452|6d1ad449||Certain merchants will sell you a Potion of Clearance. This potion returns all your spent Ability Points and lets you redistribute them as you wish.
   1091453|6d1ad45f||If you tire out a shield bearer (deplete his Stamina completely), he'll drop his shield, making it much easier to defeat him.
   1091454|6d1ad460||There's regular gear - and then there's gear that can be crafted only by a true master. Such craftsmen are rare and difficult to find. One resides somewhere in Velen, while another is said to live in Novigrad. In order to unlock the use of their services, you must first complete a Quest related to each.
   1091478|6d1ad461||Light Armor does not provide much protection, but your Stamina will regenerate quickly when it is equipped. Medium Armor and Heavy Armor absorb more damage, but cause your Stamina to regenerate more slowly.
   1091479|6d1ad462||The total number of gwent cards you can win from merchants is limited, and you can only win one card from each merchant.
   1091480|6d1ad463||Pursuing witcher contracts on rare monsters can be a route to acquiring legendary witcher gear.
   1091481|6d1ad464||Using the Eye of Nehaleni, you can dispel illusions and gain access to new game areas. Look for the Eye in Velen.

I can't eat or sleep, my master threatens to terminate my apprenticeship - and I don't even know if you remember me! Albert Vegelbud introduced us near the roasted capon table - I happened to be eating one when I saw you, it stuck in my throat and I started to choke - and you laughed, oh, how sweetly, how brightly you laughed! That marvelous sound still fills my ears to this day and I live in the hope that I will be given a chance to hear it once more. I beg you, meet with me, even if just for a moment, just for a second. I will wait by the well in Gildorf every day at dusk. If you care for the life of a poor lad fallen hopelessly in love with you, take pity and come - do not torture me with eternal waiting.<br><br>Your truly devoted admirer,<br>Ghilbert Blith

   1135722|6f1db9a4||The essence of Evil is to cause suffering. There exist many varieties of suffering: from common corporeal pain through the rarefied torment of the psyche to deep wounds dealt to the soul. Whence then does Evil arise? Does it appear on its own? Or does it only spread when conditions are ripe? And finally, the most important question: How can Evil be defeated?<br><br>Most believe Evil has always existed, for none remember a time when it did not. Yet is that sufficient proof? I dare to doubt it, for I am a scholar, and the essence of scholarship is to question all hypotheses until they have been rigorously proven.<br><br>The appearance of Evil is closely tied to the existence of Good, its opposite and antithesis. Good without evil is dimensionless and therefore imperceptible. Evil, then, is an integral part of our lives.<br><br>Evil wears many faces and appears in many different forms. One of them wears a skin of flesh. This Evil incarnated as man travels the world, sowing death and suffering. Such Evil is devious and difficult to discern. We usually only note its presence when it is already too late.<br><br>In my scholarly wanderings through the myths and legends of a great many cultures, I’ve come across descriptions of a certain individual which all display a striking similarity. I do not mean in terms of this individual’s outer appearance or name, but of his modus operandi. This Evil works through trickery, tempting at first with the offer of something seemingly good. The price one must pay for this object of temptation, however, is enormous and nonrefundable, and the promised good often contains horrifying hooks and treacherous traps. Beware, then, of any who promise the impossible, for such can only be delivered through the machinations of Evil.

   1087435|6f94f51c||Though Spikeroog is not the most frequently-visited of the Skellige Isles, one cannot deny it has a certain inescapable charm. Particularly bewitching are the snow-capped peaks towering over its southern and western shores.<br><br>Spikeroog will surely please lovers of the martial arts. The northern portion of the isle is home to a famed arena where local warriors test their strength in no-holds-barred bouts. South of the arena lies the village of Svorlag, home to Clan Brokvar. Located on a picturesque bay, Svorlag is particularly lovely to visit in the summer and around the feasts of Belleteyn. South of Svorlag sprawls a primeval wilderness that serves as Clan Brokvar's chief hunting grounds.<br><br>Visiting the southern portions of the isle should be reserved only for extremely experienced travelers, for they are completely wild, inhospitable and deprived of all human settlements. The area is crawling with dangerous creatures of all kinds (described in more detail in the "Fauna and Flora" section). One should also show particular caution  when traveling near the caves along the isle's coast.

   1208923|700275b1||Once upon a time, in a small mound near the Vermentino vineyard, there lived a wight named Franconi. Amiable by nature, he spent his days in the mound, cooking various kinds of soups. Not that he was particularly fond of soups – it was his beloved pet, a barghest named Spikey, that slurped them up greedily. And so they sat there, side by side, Franconi the Wight and Spikey the Barghest, cooking soups made of decaying bones, withered weeds and, if they managed to swipe some metal, nails, their favorite delicacy.<br><br>One day Franconi heard two gravediggers talk about a certain man of wealth who kept various kinds of cheese in his cellar. A cheese soup sounded like a delectable treat to Franconi, so he snuck into the noble’s cellar and stole the biggest cheese wheel there was. When he got home, Franconi started slowly melting the cheese in his favorite pot. The stench was so awful Spikey ran off and refused to go back to the mound. To add to the already terrible state of things, the smell of cheese permeated everything, so Spikey and Franconi had to pack their things and move.<br><br>The moral of the story is simple. If you are cooking a cheese soup, make sure the cheese you choose is not blue.

   1058745|70710c11||It came as a surprise to many when, a mere three years after the Second War against Nilfgaard - the war which, it was said, “would end all wars” - the empire’s forces once again invaded the North. To the perceptive student of history, however, this development was not at all surprising - Nilfgaard’s economy and political system have for decades relied on expansion and conquest for continued survival.<br><br>Attentive analysis shows that Nilfgaard never abandoned its plan to subjugate the North. Contrary to popular belief, imperial diplomats, and not sorceresses, were behind the death of King Foltest. They also brought about the crisis during the summit of mages and monarchs at Loc Muinne. The current conflict is thus the result of cold calculation and long-term planning. Before the wax had time to dry on the Peace of Cintra, Emhyr var Emreis had already begun to prepare for the next war, which ultimately broke out in the spring of 1270.<br><br>The war's first stage went exactly as the emperor had planned. In a matter of months Lyria, Aedirn and Temeria found themselves in the shadow of the black banner. If not for the early frosts of December 1270 and the daring of King Radovid - who, instead of concentrating his forces on the Pontar, invaded Kaedwen thereby doubling his territory and strength - all the North would surely now be but another province in the vast Empire of Nilfgaard.

Yet neither the knights errant nor the druids nor anyone else proved up to the task – until a poor raftsman named Flovive figured out a way. He serenaded the frogs with his violin and they, entranced by his melody, followed him out of the duchy. In memory of this event, the settlement where Toussaint’s raftsmen dwell bears his name.

   1206344|70fcbc07||The last day of the tourney had come and it was now clear Gottfried would tilt against the mysterious Chessboard Knight in the joust. Gottfried was the ducal champion at the time, so all were counting on his victory. No one knew a thing about the Chessboard Knight except that he had come from the south in dark armor and had a shield bearing  sixty-four black-and-white squares.<br><br>When the herald trumpeted the signal, the knights charged at each other. Gottfried’s lance shattered against the Chessboard Knight’s shield and the mysterious knight swayed in his saddle. No mere mortal could have survived such a blow, yet the Chessboard Knight did not fall from his horse, but instead struck a blow of his own on the next pass, knocking Gottfried to the ground.<br><br>The victor approached his defeated foe, stuck out his hand and helped him stand. Before the herald could announce his victory, he took off his helm and all beheld his eyes of coal and face of burnt cinders.<br><br>”I have come from a time long passed to remind you of humility, which is a long-forgotten virtue. My name was consumed by dragon fire when I perished, victim of my own pride.”<br><br>After saying these words the Chessboard Knight rode off. No one stopped him, yet they repeat his warning to this day.

   1208571|715055d4||The experimental attempts to manage the waters of the Sansretour Marsh carried out by Duke Adam of Nazair did not prove very successful – to put it lightly. They flooded a great number of villages, private estates and even Arthach, an elven summer palace. These experiments were what gave the Sansretour Marsh its current shape and put half of Crane Isle permanently underwater. They also created an unpleasant bog to the north of the city where none can tread in true safety.

Many lost the path, others, their minds, and still others, their lives.<br><br>We came to a crossroads. One trail led to a world bursting with green, the other - to the mountainous isles the dh’oine later called Skellige. We could not agree where to go, where we would be safer, further from the White Frost. We split. Those who dwelt amidst the cliffs and rocks are called the Aen Seidhe. Those who built new homes in the land of forests are known as the Aen Elle.<br><br>We were the same, once. Now we are other. We look for each other in the stars. We speak to each other through the mouths of the Aen Saevherne. We listen to ballads about the proud Aen Elle folk. We mourn the fate of the Aen Seidhe, enslaved by the dh’oine. We remember the olden days. We await the White Frost and the next migration - or our death.

Leave in a cool place for at least two hours. Boil the chanterelles till they are soft, but don’t make jam out of them – remember, al dente, you fool! Prepare the tagliatelle in the same way. If you make mush here, you might as well hang up your apron, for you’re no chef. Once the turkey’s taken on the bouquet’s fragrance, throw it in a pan with the heated olive oil. Pour in the wine – once it’s boiled off, toss in the pasta. Let it fry for a bit. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the noodles. Give it all a good peppering. Add two tablespoons of ricotta – mix thoroughly. Plate the dish and decorate with the arugula.

   1122936|7406f1b2||I’ve naught left. Not a blooming thing. All I can do now's pass on my family's tale of horror and woe, then pass on myself, soon as I’ve written it all up in this letter.<br><br>Seems a faded dream now, but there were a time when we were happy. My beautiful wife, Ornesta, and myself.  We were married in high style, with a fitting feast, then a year later our dear Mildburga was born. Folk praised the wean’s beauty, said she were the spitting image of her mum. Ornesta’d get all cross when they talked like that, but I paid it no heed at the time. Soon enough our family grew. First Matilda, then Ethel came into the world, both fair as angels. But Ornesta… well, I’ll never forget the eve she sat there, combing her long, chestnut hair while the girls cried and cried. I said to her, “Love, I reckon the lasses’re hungry.” That’s when she lashed out at me for the first time. Said they'd no right to be hungry – they’d stolen her beauty and her youth, that should be more than enough to feed on…<br><br>I should’ve known it then. I should’ve guessed madness had burrowed into my love’s head, and every compliment paid to her lasses' beauty made it burrow ever deeper. Year by year, the young'un's grew taller and more lovely. But time’s not so kind to the old, and Ornesta weren't spared its cruelty, which took her skin’s spring and its sheen of youth.<br><br>One night I was awoken by a startling moon which lit all the world in an eerie glow. I looked around the hut, and saw it was empty. I ran out the door and followed a set of bare footprints, leading to the cemetery by the chapel. Seeing that, my heart jumped up into my throat…<br><br>I found them, all three, lying around the fountain. Were I not been their father, I’d never have recognized them. Deep gashes mutilated their fair faces. Strips of skin and hunks of flesh were strewn all about… As I stood beholding this butchery, I had the feeling someone was watching me. And I weren't mistaken. Ornesta stood there on a stool by a lone tree. She had a rope draped ‘round her neck like some demonic necklace. “They took it from me, all of it, all I had, all I cherished,” she said. Then she jumped.<br><br>She’s dead. My Ornesta. My three daughters – dead as well. I’ll soon join them. I’ve taken all I have and gave it to the gods, perhaps they’ll forgive me and my beloved Ornesta…

For no man knows the day or the hour, nor does any sailor know when a small dot at the edge of his vision will turn into a Nilfgaardian dromond racing towards him, its sails puffed full and its prow ready to cleave his hull like an axe.<br><br>Prevention is the first and best way to avoid such collisions: you must keep your eyes pried wide open, even when the waters are smooth as a newborn's hinterquarters and there's not a speck of land nor a hint of foreign flag to be seen. When vision fails in dark or murk, one must keep an ear cocked, especially in the waters near Skellige, for the oarsmen of the Archipelago add muster to their rowing with song and their thunderous voices carry far, so they can often be heard before they are seen. And it's a powerful boon that they thus reveal themselves, for a collision with a Skellige longship damns one doubly, for the vessel itself is armored prow to stern, while inside are ferocious, battle-hardened warriors.

A cradle erected upon Redanian soil, nurturing the greatest minds not only of that kingdom, but of all the North. To walk its hallowed Academy's halls is to embark on a journey through learning, from the finest points of Philosophy to the grandest strokes of Art, with stops made to admire Architecture and dissect Medicine along the way.<br><br>Peer to either side, and you will spy fellow travelers in your pilgrimage of learning - the students. They throng Oxenfurt's streets, lending it an indelible imprint of youth that can be felt the moment you pass through its gates. Dormitories stand cheek by jowl, booksellers hawk used tomes on every corner, and under every tree fresh faces debate poetry with passion.<br><br>Yet youth is not all slate and compass, and the young here shirk none of its other typical pastimes. Raucous and merry are the city streets, both by day and, even more so, by night. Though the city councilors have forbidden the sale of alcohol after dusk, no one seems eager to enforce this with stricture - and wisely so, for any loss of sleep is more than made up for by the gains: profits to fatten its innkeepers' pockets, and the late-night crooning of troubadours to enrich its soul.<br><br>As for its architecture, of particular note are the recently renovated elven aqueducts used to clean the city sewers. They stand as witness to the city's innovative spirit - you will not find their like in all the civilized world. Yet dominating the town's architectural visage like a glistening crown is the complex of buildings that comprises the Oxenfurt Academy. Few today remember that these edifices, constructed by the elves, predate the city itself - it is the institution that named the city, and not vice-versa.<br><br>Today Oxenfurt Academy enjoys a reputation matched only by the Imperial Academy in Nilfgaard. Of greatest renown - the departments of Alchemy, Natural History, Minstrelsy and Poetry, Medicine and Herbology, Engineering and, last but certainly not least, Philosophy.

   1062855|74db46ed||Excavations to be carried out by Gottfried Oss, Michelle Sabina Ruxer and Marco Gedl, under the supervision of Professor Sigismund Gloger.<br><br>We have begun excavation work under the aegis of the Oxenfurt Academy and with kind sponsorship from Prince Adrien of the Sea Cats. Our goal is to find the legendary treasure of King Maeglor of Est Tayiar.<br><br>8th of Blathe, 1st day of excavations<br>I am deeply worried about the witcher present among our company. I had a bad feeling about him at the very start, during the first meeting at Castle Drahim. Now, as we trek dark underground caverns, his presence gives me shivers. Are we entirely sure his task is to protect our expedition?<br><br>Furthermore, Castle Drahim is too close to Oxenfurt for us not to have heard those unsettling rumors about Prince Adrien… (illegible fragment).<br><br>11th of Blathe, 3rd day of excavations<br>Kiyan demanded we surrender all notes found in the ruins of the elven armory. I refused.<br><br>13th of Blathe, 5th day of excavations<br>We pitched camp in a vast and dry cavern in the easterly portion of the complex. There are a few active portals here. I am afraid they are very likely unstable and unidirectional.<br><br>14th of Blathe, 6th day of excavations<br>The witcher murdered Marco! He was deciphering one of the priceless elven sketches when suddenly, as I watched on aghast, the witcher slit his throat and grabbed his incunabulum! I panicked and jumped into one of the portals. It deposited me in some chamber which has no exit. Unless an echo of the portal appears, I am stuck here for good. I hope Michelle and Gottfried managed to escape.<br><br>[remainder of the notes difficult to decipher and no dates are indicated]<br><br>I must conclude the witcher had from the very start been operating on Prince Adrien's orders. I would not be surprised if they were toasting their scheme's success Drahim Castle at this very moment. Blast it, perhaps I should have given those elven diagrams to Kiyan after all? What good are they to me here, if I am to rot in this crypt?<br><br>I have finished the last drops of my water. There is nothing to eat. No echo from the portal has appeared.<br><br>Gods...

You’ve adopted a diddling panther? A few of our men came back to camp with their bums so bitten they’ll have to doodoo standing up for weeks, and the very thought of going back on patrol has them shaking so hard their seams burst. This can’t go on. Heard you’ve even gone so daffy as to give it a name. Hobbes the panther? You’re completely off your nut, aren’t you?<br><br>Now concentrate, because I don’t feel like repeating this. The lad who brought you this letter is carrying a hefty coin pouch. That’s the lion’s share (no bleeding pun intended) of the loot from our last job. The pouch is yours, but you take that overgrown kitty somewhere out in the wilderness and slit its throat. Simple enough? For the sum you’re getting from me, you’ll buy yourself two pure-blooded greyhounds and we can forget the whole thing. That’s me being generous.

   1057782|759bd493||Skellige the political entity encompasses the archipelago of the same name, composed of twenty individual isles. The largest of them are Ard Skellig, An Skellig, Undvik, Faroe, Spikeroog and Hindarsfjall. Originally these isles were inhabited by independent clans, but these later united to face the growing threat from barbarians as well as the rising powers of the Continent. Skellige then became an elective monarchy, ruled by a king chosen from among the jarls (clan chieftains). The present leader of the Skelligers is Bran of Clan Tuirseach.<br><br>It is worth noting that, in contrast to the situation in the kingdoms on the Continent, in Skellige each inhabitant is a citizen and enjoys equal rights, regardless of birth, trade or the property they possess.<br><br>On account of the rocky and often barren terrain and inhospitable climate, the inhabitants of Skellige gain their sustenance primarily from fishing, maritime trade and armed raiding. Though this last is primarily the work of men, female warriors are not unheard of, and they equal their fathers and brothers in courage and skill. For Skelligers believe that each is master of his or her own fate, and when Freya determines a man's or woman’s destiny, she looks only to inner predispositions, and cares not for outward traits of status or sex.

I congratulate you - and at the same time inform you that you will never have the pleasure of meeting me again.<br><br>I long deluded myself into thinking I could wake the citizens of Novigrad from their slumber, make them aware of their corruption and point them on the right path - that which leads to the Eternal Fire and the cleansing it provides.<br><br>Yet even though - as you well know - I stopped at nothing in my efforts, it appears they will not bring about the desired results. Novigrad's moral pox has spread too far and too deep - it is now incurable and fatal. Though many consider me a fanatic, even I realize further shock therapy of the kind I have been administering will do no good.<br><br>I will thus depart for another, smaller settlement, where the process of moral decay has just begun and where my intervention may yet stand a chance of stopping it. Forgive me for not giving you the details of my itinerary, but I fear you would try to hinder my mission.<br><br>My regards,<br>Hubert Rejk, alias Concerned Citizen

   1080719|760a065d||While Nilfgaard's emperor wields absolute power, harshly crushing the slightest sign of disobedience, opposing forces continue to exist within the empire. By this I do not mean the disgruntled leaders of conquered provinces, but the magnates within the City of a Thousand Towers who are unhappy with the current leadership. This conflict between the emperor and the noble houses of Nilfgaard the capital dates back many years. All the princes of the blood and magnates expected their ruler to wed one of their daughters and sire an heir with one of their own. The emperor, however, had other plans. This proved a slap in the face for all the great families from which he refused to take a bride.<br><br>The Nilfgaardian opposition patiently waits for the emperor to slip up, for some event to occur which will weaken his authority, be it an economic crisis or a defeat in battle. A secret conspiracy lies ready to seize such a moment to incite the disaffected, assassinate the emperor and carry out a coup d'état culminating with one of their own number ascending to the throne.<br><br>For obvious reasons, only a limited few know of this conspiracy, but any shrewd observer of Nilfgaardian politics can read the signs of its workings. So long as men are men and the world is as it is, certain dynamics will forever remain the same, and the discontented will always form subversive societies with their secret signs and hidden agendas.

The cult of Lebioda, popular in the North… [illegible fragment]<br>The cult was flourishing in Toussaint at that time due to the deeds of a supposed disciple of Lebioda - Plegmund. I say "supposed" because no one ever… [illegible fragment]<br>The miracles that Plegmund worked in those days were on everyone’s lips. Even one of my… [illegible fragment]<br>For Plegmund, though, the beautiful temple built according to his designs in the south of the city was not enough. He was out for something larger - literally! He managed to persuade the duchess that the most magnificent symbol of good people of Toussaint’s faith would be a statue... [illegible fragment]<br>Soon after work started at Ardaiso, whose foreman I was at the time, as you know, it emerged that Plegmund was a fraud. He was no miracle worker, but rather miracle swindler, who… [illegible section]<br>And then he disappeared into thin air, along with most of the coin gathered to build the statue.

   1139594|776ddc93||Ever since arachnomorphs – commonly known as pitchfiends or knotlegs – first wandered from the east and into the lands of the Northern Realms, much has been said and written about them, and much of this has been none too wise. Bits of this passed-down knowledge have contained a few grains of truth, others, but distant echoes, while others still were clearly pulled out of some pseudo-scholar’s rear end. I therefore feel it my duty, as the most eminent expert on insectoids north of the Yaruga, to separate the truth from the lies, like grain from so much chaff, and share the results with the people.<br><br>Let us begin with the basics. Arachnomorphs are unusually swift, even for arachnids. It is difficult to flee them, on horseback as well as afoot. Even if one does outpace them at first, his rescue is but temporary, for they are able to spew webs from great distance which entangle their victim’s legs in a flash. Larger individuals, mistakenly considered a separate species by some, are in addition especially skillful jumpers.<br><br>The best slayers of arachnomorphs are witchers: by using well-chosen oils and Signs, such as Aard, Yrden or Axii, they are able to face and defeat these creatures. That provides but little comfort to the rest of us, however, for there are fewer and fewer of these monster slayers by the year, while the monsters themselves grow ever greater in number.

   1165127|78161b76||My Darling Pascal,<br><br>I trust this missive finds you in good health. As you know, my affections for you are powerful beyond all measure, and I yearn for you to become my husband with all my being. Soon we shall stand together at the marital altar, but I hope you understand this must be a ceremony to make the duquessa herself green with envy! Do not think this an admonishment in any way, my dear, but we both know your modest soldier’s wage will not allow us to put on the extravagant ball which we both deserve. But do not be sad! I have found a solution to our little problem!<br><br>You surely know about the shipwreck on the bottom of the Sansretour, but I doubt you know the full history of how it came to be there. Back in the time of Duke Raymund, one of the wealthiest men in the duchy, Gaël Sasque, decided to hold a ball in the middle of the river. And what a ball it was… Beautifully coiffed grandes dames, elegant gentlemen in white shirts and striking doublets… Gaël apparently took a crate of jewelry aboard and changed rings multiple times to impress all with his wealth. The event was in full swing when, suddenly, a violent storm rolled in. The wind snapped the masts and capsized the vessel. All the wealthy guests, draped in gold and jewels, sank to the bottom in a flash! This tragic story might yet have a happy ending, however, for I have obtained the key to Gaël Sasque's chest!<br><br>I imagine you know see why our future prosperity is within easy reach. After all, the drowned dead do not need diamonds, am I not right?<br><br>Loving You More Than Life Itself,<br><br>Bella de Gunness

A map of Est Tayiar, crafting diagrams of elven provenance (margin note: highly interesting sketch for a one-handed crossbow, most likely used to hunt draconids or ornithosaurs, must ask about this during interrogation. Confirms my theory that the witchers of the Cat School use elven weapons.) and, wait for it…. Professor Sigismund Gloger’s notes.

   1076472|7888d694||A soldier can wear a dirty jerkin, rank footcloths and stained greaves. A soldier can walk around unshaven, can stink to high heaven or even have the mange. But his sword must always shine as if straight from the forge! For in a battle neat clothing and an eye-pleasing appearance will not save anyone's life, but a sword will, as long as its well-cared for and the man at the dull end knows what he's doing.<br><br>So how should you care for your blade? Simple. After every battle, wipe all the blood and guts off of it, take an oil-soaked linen rag and give it a good rub down. If you're fighting in swamplands or in heavy rain, it's worth your while to coat the blade in beeswax. You should sharpen its edges regularly, using a good whetstone. It's important to take your time in doing this - each movement should be steady and delicate, like you're stroking a virgin on your first night together.<br><br>If your sword develops rust, it means you're slovenly and lazy oaf. Take some sand in your hand at once and scour the blade till the stains disappear. Take heed, though, not to cut your fingers in the doing, for then you won't be any good to anyone.

Rage burns my entrails. Writing this is the only way I know to calm the flames.<br><br>When I am an old man and read these notes, I believe a certain Maximus Nonius Macrinus will be long dead. A pitiful memory. For now, however, he lives. Why do I write about this? A few days ago I challenged him to a duel. To the death. He had been drooling over my Lucienne and I could not bear it. He proved to be a better swordsman than I. But that is not the worst. A lost finger is nothing compared to lost honor. Maximus defeated me, yet instead of killing me, he spared my life. Never shall I forget the faces of the men who turned their eyes from me then.<br>I know I shall never know peace until I have dealt with him.<br><br>[a dozen or so blank pages]<br><br>I have found the journal which I was given by my father several years ago. During the time since I last held it, much has occurred in my life. I have fled Toussaint and sought my fortune in various places. With varied success. The worst, however, is that my hand has yet to grasp Maximus’ throat. I know it is only a matter of time.<br><br>I have decided to return to that hound-botched duchy. We have pitched camp on Mont Crane. I’ve carefully selected a band of men who will not flee from any task, any foe. The Toussaint which once forced me to run will now repay me in full. The highest price, however, shall be paid by Maximus Nonius Macrinus. When I get my hands on him, he will dream of one thing: death.<br>I’ve got the harlotsbrood! He’s lording it up at the Casteldaccia estate. He was given it by that sodden tart Anarietta – seems Duke Raymund’s been dead for a few years. Tomorrow my lads will pay him a visit. I shan’t go with them, however. The very thought of having to see his maggoty face again makes me ill. Farewell, Maximus, I have signed your death warrant.<br><br>I’m delighted. Maximus and all his family now rot. Their stench is a delight to stray mutts. Whenever I close my eyes, I see them perish. See them scream, moan and grovel. That makes my dinger stand firmer than even the curviest harlot could. I am at last satisfied.<br>

I hope that storm I summoned smashed it into those craggy rocks off the Grassy Knoll shore.<br><br>The experiments which my students conducted on drowners in my absence did not yield the expected results. As usual, I must do everything myself.<br><br>I will administer a brew of medicinal opium to the subject. This “milk of the poppy” will keep the witcher in a state of half-consciousness, and thus incapable of any resistance. Commencing studies.<br><br>Note: I must hold off on my planned experiments while I clear up the demolished portion of my laboratory. I have set the bones in the forearm of one of my assistants. I will now administer a quadruple dose of “milk of the poppy” to the witcher.<br><br>Day 4.<br>Subject shows incredible resistance to physical torture. Only broke after the second day of intense labor. Moderately satisfactory results from the interrogation. Garnered information about witcher training and the Cat School of witchers in general. As I suspected, the Cat School witchers are for the most part of elven stock. This school must have some tie to the Elder Races (addendum: perhaps its founder was a member of the Aen Seidhe?<br><br>Subject unfit for further study. I have discontinued his doses of poppy.<br><br>Day 7.<br>Administered extract of cowbane and hemlock. In typical representatives of the human and Aen Seidhe species such a mixture provokes paralysis of the peripheral nervous system, and eventually of the nerve endings as well. This results in muscular, skeletal, pulmonary and cardiac paralysis, and ultimately death through suffocation.<br><br>The witcher is not, however, a typical representative of any species. Though the poison did seem to cause some mild irritation (sic!) in his nervous system, his mutated body quickly managed to neutralize the harmful alkaloids.<br><br>In a matter of hours all symptoms of the poison I administered have vanished.<br><br>Day 15.<br>Stinging him with sea wasp toxin did not provoke the expected results. In order to strengthen the toxin’s effect I have poured ethyl alcohol into his wounds. His nervous system seems to be immune.<br><br>Day 26.<br>The subject has been tortured, poisoned, burnt, frozen, starved and dehydrated, and despite it all his body continues to function. He eats and drinks by himself, moves about his cell on his own and is able to articulate simple words (“please”, “drink”, “don’t hurt”, “stop”).<br><br>Conclusion: as I suspected the witcher is a superb energumen! A demon trapped in such an excellently prepared body will become death incarnate, vengeful wrath made flesh – and placed at my command. No one has succeeded in creating a being of such power since the times of Malaspin and Alzur.<br><br>This is a great day for science!<br><br>Time to begin the incantations.

We grow stronger by the day and will soon show the Nilfgaardian vermin that the Temerian nation will not bear its yoke without a fight. If your heart bleeds blue and golden lilies, you will sooner die for your country than live as a slave to foreigners. Let us swear by our fathers who fell to the beasts at Sodden! By the souls of the dead buried at Brenna! To arms!

   1046779|7a8c6c02||To my dear friends, Phillip and Anna - from Count la Guevre, Minister of Culture for the Kingdom of Temeria.<br>Vizima, 1265<br><br>Whoever thinks curses are only ever manifestations of one being's ill will towards another is sorely mistaken. Shockingly commonplace are reports of curses cast unwittingly on oneself or on objects in one's immediate environment. The consequences of doing so can be difficult to predict. In many cases they lead to harm or even the death of the person afflicted by the curse, or of the people spending time with the object or being on which the curse fell. That is why it is so essential to take preventative measures to safeguard oneself as thoroughly as possible against the casting of curses. As an absolute minimum Madame Amelia Veracruz-Leon recommends: cleansing oneself of all negative thoughts, striving to be at one with the world and achieving harmony between body and mind.

   1209052|7b1a419e||Bruxae are an incarnation of man’s worst fears. They resemble women or nymphs, so they can blend into the crowd unnoticeably, even though in truth they are bloodsuckers – ruthless vampires savoring human blood, for whom man is nothing but a toy. There is no beast more dreadful than one that can disguise as one of us - a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But there is another reason why bruxae chill our blood - this female creature kindles man's hidden fear of sexuality and of being dominated by a woman.

Near half the longships carry privateers in the Empire’s employ. Now what’s old Nilfgaard want a pirate fleet for? And why’s she anchored in Bremevoord?<br><br>Done loading. All passengers on board. We’re leaving Bremevoord, course set for Novigrad.<br><br>Strange. A mage paid through the nose to share a cabin with the witcher. Freaks are drawn to each other, it seems.<br><br>That witcher’s a real treasure. It’s not just about monsters – even customs officers are more civil with Kiyan around. And they aren’t as annoyingly scrupulous as usual. Seems the legends surrounding our witcher have curtailed their zeal.<br><br>Pressure’s falling rapidly. Wind’s changed directions. Could use that mage now, one that followed the witcher like a shadow, but the two of them are nowhere to be found. Cowards.<br><br>Boatswain says he heard a terrible ruckus in the witcher’s cabin this morning, with bright flashes coming out from under the door. Been quiet since. Must investigate.<br><br>Their cabin’s empty. Can’t search the ship now, need to reef the sails. Won’t make it to port, must stay out at sea. We’ll raise the staysails and hope the gods watch over us from there.

Killed twelve does, eight stags, thirty-two hares and seven boars. Meat'll be cleaned, salted and set to dry in the sun. Hides'll be taken to the camp by Zuetzer Castle. Before long we'll beat the bush, shoot some fowl. Hunters have spied pheasant, wild duck and partridge in the area. Plenty of everything, really, so hunger shan't be a problem this winter.<br><br>IMPORTANT: Some local hunter wandered into camp, introducing himself as Gavel Matt. Sold us a bear hide (top quality) and promised to return with another. Soon as he does, we’ll bind him in fetters and burn his heels, because there’s something damned fishy about him.<br><br>Lieutenant Von Herst

It didn't all go exactly like I'd imagined as a little girl, but, well, you always taught me to make the most of what I've got. We're traveling now, so I'll send this letter as soon as we arrive.<br><br>I'll start with what I'm sure interests you the most - financial matters. As I'm sure you've noticed, a few crowns have gone missing from your lockbox, the cupboard's a couple silver plates lighter, and your jewelry box isn't near as full as it once was. I took it. As my dowry. No doubt much less than you'd have given, had I but found myself a "worthy partner," but, tough, that's life.<br><br>Kurt – or, as you like to call him, "that good-for-nothing bare-arsed lazybones" - is now my husband. And your daughter's precious purity, which you cared about more than her feelings, tears or pleadings - well, it's only a memory now.<br><br>We'll soon arrive at our destination. Naturally, I won't tell you where exactly that is - just in case you get it in your head to come visit. Wherever it is, know your silver will be enough to set up a nice home. That's important - because I'm expecting a child. Are you glad? I doubt it. You always said poor matches only produce mutts and scoundrels. So it's a good thing you'll never have to see this one.<br><br>Your little girl,<br><br>-Jeanette

These damned Nilfgaardian bureaucrats refuse to let anyone cross the border. I’ve already arranged to set out tomorrow for Aedirn with a band of dwarves.

Stay true to yourselves as the good folk you are and always take care of each other.<br><br>Until we meet in Rivia,<br><br>Your father, Robert S.

Dried twigs covered the sheet - that was the first proof, for werewolves return at dawn after a night of hunting, their bare feet covered in the forest's droppings. They found the second proof under his bed: a wolf's hide. The werewolf surely dressed himself in it when transforming with the setting sun, and shed it again when he turned to man the next day. Having found these powerful proofs they ceased deliberation and began the hunt, vowing to find the lycanthrope and bind him in silver chains.

The wanted man, a recruit who recently volunteered to join His Imperial Majesty's service, goes by the name of Odrin. He claimed to be a Kaedweni by birth, but said King Henselt's misrule had convinced him to join the Imperial Army. He was part of said institution for a mere two days, but managed to eat and drink enough in that time for an entire regiment of dragoons. Anyone with information about this deserter's present location is to report to the garrison at once.<br><br>Description: Modest stature, wiry, with thinning hair. He fled in his undergarments by squeezing out through the latrines' drainage system and probably thus reeks like an old boar. Characteristic marks: can be easily recognized by his voice, which has the tell-tale rasp of a hardened alcoholic. Anyone found providing shelter or sustenance to this deserter will be subjected to a summary court-martial.

    374586|7dd45a6b||It'll not come as news to most, but let me repeat for the ignorant: a few of our lads went looking for ore in the mountains and never returned. They must've run into trouble, and since those brave warriors couldn't handle it themselves, it must've been serious trouble indeed. That's why I'm looking for a brave man to go up and suss out what's become of them. Whoever does so will get gold to match his glory.<br><br>-Gjarr, village elder of Blandare

   1057914|7de14085||From farmers and herdsmen, milkmaids to midwives - all the common folk of the Continent whisper, sharing tales of a wraithly procession pounding across the sky. The Wild Hunt, they call it. Winds and gales, storms and blizzards arise when it is sighted, and all grows cold, though the sun shone bright moments before. Some remember only the cold from the shock of the encounter, and claim the Riders come always in winter. But nay, this is not so - the Hunt brings its own ice.<br><br>Death and war gallop in its wake, or so the superstition goes. Yet evil enough is the Hunt itself. It takes folk captive, youths, most often, in the prime of their wilding years, with ten to twenty summers behind them. The Hunt rushes in and they disappear, only to return long years later with no memory of what passed in the time between. (...)

They are instead a family forged by warriors who have heard the "call of the bear" and answered it by abandoning their loved ones and joining the community of mountain dwellers.<br><br>Not every man who seeks to join it is accepted into the brotherhood: the candidates must first pass difficult trials which usually end in their death. The last trial is the hardest. It is called the "Trial of the Bear's Triumph," but few outside the brotherhood have ever witnessed it and none know what those who undergo it must endure.<br><br>Quite curiously, the inhabitants of Skellige themselves know very little about the berserkers, or "vildkaarls," as they call them. They do not like to talk about these man-bears, not with outsiders and not even amongst themselves.

   1061808|7fef2684||War with Nilfgaard first broke out in 1263 - its immediate cause a clear act of aggression by Nilfgaard against Cintra. The Imperial Army crossed the Amell Mountains and attacked Cintra's southern border posts near the forest known as Erlenwald. There are unverified claims of Emhyr var Emreis having a special attachment for this place - their import, however, remains unknown. What is certain is that he long ago staked an unfounded claim to control over all Cintra.<br><br>The decisive battle of the conflict took place in the Marnadal Valley. There Nilfgaard surrounded and decimated Cintra’s forces led by the royal couple. King Eist Tuirseach fell in the battle. The survivors, led by Queen Calanthe, sought shelter in the capital, yet none was to be found there. The city was overrun, its population massacred, and Queen Calanthe preferred to take her own life rather than surrender to the invaders.<br><br>The theater of war then shifted to Upper Sodden, where acts of terror and barbarous cruelty were perpetrated. Historical consensus holds that the Imperial Army's bestial acts here propelled the North to victory during the so-called Second Battle of Sodden. The atrocities had left the northern forces with only two options: to win the war, or to die with their families. Desperate determination thus drove them to defeat the seemingly invincible Nilfgaardians. The next year, in 1264, an armistice was signed which ceded control of Cintra to the empire, making it the northernmost province of Nilfgaard in all but name.

These wonderful creatures, the sight of which reminds me of home, have most likely chosen this area to settle in because of the presence of shaelmaars, whose droppings constitute the food of smaller animals, which, in turn, are consumed by scolopendros. Sometimes I sneak up on them when they are feeding and admire their hooked limbs, mandibles so sturdy they seem made of iron, and chitinous thoraces shiny enough to let one to gaze upon one's reflection…

   1208420|8276e255||[Journal kept chaotically, dates missing, ink blots abound]<br><br>What on earth got into me?! Humming one of Master Dandelion’s ballads in front of Her Illustrious Grace?! Ugh, to fall into disfavor in such a foolish way… I, a young, ambitious politician with brilliant career prospects at the ducal court, now find myself exiled due to my own stupidity. I must find a way to plead the duchess’ forgiveness…<br><br>They say the emperor has offered the duquessa a very strange gift: a shaelmaar! The knights are to face off against it during the tourney. Now, were I to make a similar offering to Her Illustrious Grace...<br><br>Inconceivable! The gods have smiled on me! I ran into a witcher in Belhaven willing to help me catch a young shaelmaar. Naturally he demanded a fortune for his services, but I am ready to do anything to get myself out of the duchess’ black books. The witcher collected a down payment and set off for the Amell Mountains...<br><br>I’ve got it! Success! With an offering for Her Grace worthy of an emperor, I can at last return to the duchy and seek forgiveness! Now I need only find a way to transport the shaelmaar to Beauclair...<br><br>I gathered my entire retinue and together we embarked on the good ship Suzanne. With the current in our favor, we should be in the capital in a mere three days!<br><br>I feel like the hero of some elven tragedy. Just when it seems all is going perfectly, catastrophes fall from the sky and pummel me to the ground… The shaelmaar chewed through the deck, sank the ship and dug its way into the river bottom. I begged the captain to help me capture the monster in exchange for the rest of my fortune. As the witcher instructed, I will light incense made of rue and direct the smoke at the monster, which should calm it. The sailors can then capture it in their nets.<br><br>I am finished. The rue incense did not work. The shaelmaar flew into a rage and killed nearly everyone. True, the captain managed to escape, but I could see he was badly wounded, so I doubt he managed to swim out of that cavern. Now I sit here alone, listening to the shaelmaar devour the remains of the murdered sailors.<br><br>You! The person who has found my journal, whoever you may be! Take the rest of my fortune – for what good is a chest of jewels to a pile of moldy bones? But in exchange, please, drink to my health, to my sad fate, to the hero of a true elven tragedy.

   1058761|836690cb||Sad as it may be, to many in our time the word "elf" is a synonym for pauper, bandit or layabout. "She-elf" is used by many to denote a prostitute or woman of loose morals. The adjective "elven," in turn, describes damaged, needlessly complicated or useless goods. Statistics, for their part, show that one in three elves living in Redania has spent time in prison, and a full one half of them have been fined at least once. The average lifespan of elves, though still thrice that of humans, grows shorter each year.<br><br>Given the above it is easy to forget that elves - or Aen Seidhe, as they fashion themselves - were once a proud race that ruled the lands stretching from the banks of the Great Sea in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and from the Dragon Mountains in the North to the Mahakam range in the south. The ruins of their cities scattered throughout the known world bear witness to their former might (cp. “Monumenta Elforum” by Istredd of Aedd Gynvael).<br>Many of the most outstanding mages, artists and poets of recorded history have been of this race. And we have elves to thank for dozens of ingenuous items we rely on each day, from screw pumps to cosmetics.<br>Those elves who dwell amongst men have largely forgotten their history and culture - the sole sliver of elven identity left in them being a burning hatred for humans, whom they refer to as <i>dh’oine</i>. The elves of Dol Blathanna, that puppet vassal of Nilfgaard, and of the wild highlands of the Blue Mountains have retained much of the old knowledge and culture, though they, too, are condemned to perish. This death sentence was handed to them by biology - for men, though short-lived, are several times more fertile than elves. Thus, while the Aen Seidhe's numbers continue to dwindle, ours grow at an alarming and ever-increasing rate.<br>Some elves believe that the tide of events can be turned, that they can put a stop to human expansion and, ultimately, to their oppression by men. They look to their mythical cousins for salvation - to the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk. The Aen Elle are said to dwell in another world or possibly another plane to which they traveled during the mythic Age of Migration, and from which they at times journey to visit our world. Legend claims a gate between the worlds could be opened, allowing the Aen Elle to ride to their downtrodden brethren's rescue. These are, however, mere fables, naïve fairy tales this race condemned to extinction uses to provide itself small comfort in these, their last, sad moments.

But now they've truly gone too botching far! They've brought buckets of vine-devouring caterpillars to Vermentino. You'll get your comeuppance, rat-diddlers!

Verily I say unto you - blind is he who fails to see their evolutionary advantage over all other species. After all, is there another creature so perfectly adjusted to living under the ground, as well as on top of it? Another being able to pelt through passages invisible to the naked eye and construct stunning subterranean cities?!<br><br>Verily I say unto you – let us bow before the divinity of a thousand limbs before it is too late! Let us shelter behind the chitin thorax, on which the swords of our enemies shall break! Let us bring nourishment for the great mandible! Let us devote ourselves to these wonderful giants, these titanic insectoids, these scolopendromorphs! Let us resemble shaelmaars – their humble servants, who make it possible for this grand species to become even stronger and even greater. Our toil shall be rewarded, I promise you this!<br><br>Praise the great mandible!

   1061823|862df541||Temeria… a land where milk and honey once flowed. In what did she wrong the gods that they should treat her so cruelly? The Pearl of the North to some, she proved a galloping range for Nilfgaardian cavalry to others. As a country it had survived two previous wars against the empire. It was here that the wars' bloodiest battles were fought. It was in Temeria where their most bestial deeds were wrought. It was Temerian civilians who bore the full brunt of these wars' horrors.<br><br>And bear them we did, bravely and steadfastly, until the demise of our great protector - King Foltest. Then providence turned its fickle face from Temeria. Murdered most treacherously, Foltest failed to leave Temeria a worthy successor.<br><br>And so all manner of cur soon fell upon her, tearing her apart like so much carrion. She had no more allies, then. None remembered that we had once been the armor protecting the North from the designs of the mad Dancer, he who had the gravestones of his foes pounded into a ballroom floor.<br><br>A free and independent Temeria is no more. A dark-faced sun looms over her every rampart. Yet we Temerians live on. And always will. As long as folk believe, the usurper who took our beloved capital, Vizima, to treat as his property will forever peer over his shoulder in fear. For in the shadows lurks not one dagger, but the power of a nation of daggers, waiting to deal justice’s blow.

   1058781|86370749||<i>To my beloved Y. I still await your kestrel.</i><br>Istredd of Aedd Gynvael<br><br>Let us begin, dear reader, with a riddle. What links a town like Vizima, the proud capital of Temeria, or Oxenfurt, a center of learning for all the North, with Aedd Gynvael, a provincial settlement at the end of the known world? Nothing, it would seem… After all, each of these places looks, sounds and even smells different. Their origins, however, are identical – all were founded atop ancient elven cities. The ruins sprawling beneath their streets bear witnesss to this fact.<br>A tour of elven monuments is best begun in Vizima - in the city sewers, to be precise. A dangerous place, to be sure, so it is worth bringing along a well-armed guide. A branch of the sewers leads to the remains of an Aen Seidhe city. One can still admire its masterfully carved plafonds, peer into its immaculately polished marble facings, find artifacts discarded by the Elder Race and hold ancient tomes that disintegrate in one’s hands. Equally impressive monuments of elven culture can be found only in Oxenfurt – as well as somewhere in the wilds of Velen, though I have been unable to verify this information personally.<br>What caused elven civilization to collapse? Plague? Cataclysm? No, dear reader. Their destruction was caused by us, by humans. We drove the elves from their cities and, instead of occupying their marvelous palaces, we dismantled them to build our meager and crooked huts. All that remains is that which we covered in debris and sludge, and then wiped from our memories for centuries.

Said estate had been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of its current owner, Emmanuel Trident de Hortense. This designation was based on reports of the presence of an unrecognized monster on the lands of said estate.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster determined to be a giant centipede (in Elder Speech: Yghern, W3 classification: insectoid, number of individuals: 3 (in words: three)). The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 13% to take into account a non-obligatory tithe for the construction of a monument to the Prophet Lebioda and was paid immediately in species.

   1083225|87c3832f||To think that man appeared on an empty world and gained mastery over it unchallenged is as foolish as thinking the world will cease to exist after man's passing. Before the first human set foot on our world, it was inhabited by beings superior to men in terms of wisdom, strength and every other virtue.<br><br>The beings I have in mind still exist in our present time, though they do not exist in a sphere available to human understanding. They occupy no dimension known to us - where they live can best be described as a space between worlds.<br><br> At times one can sense their presence through a sudden, unknown scent or a strange feeling of anxiety with no apparent cause. A wind which blows in several directions at once is another example of their subtle manifestation in our realm. There exist various imaginings of what these creatures might look like, yet these have nothing to do with reality, for man is incapable of conceiving something which he has not seen, even in his wildest nightmares.<br><br>The greatest horror these beings bring comes precisely from their indefiniteness and lack of concrete form. Yet it would be a mistake to think that a formless creature is necessarily harmless. The power they possess is sufficient to lay waste to a forest, level a city or whip an entire sea into froth and waves. Today man is master of the world, but only for a short while. They await patiently and will soon arise and regain their one-time glory. This is as certain as dawn follows dusk, and dusk then follows again soon after, to drown everything once more in darkness.

   1055858|88efaa7d||Each beast herein described in two manners ye may hunt. Either seek ye tracks, follow and strike the foulness wherever in its wild ye find it, or lure it to a chosen place and engage it there in advantageous battle. The latter poses less risk, for the hunter exposes no chance for an unexpected fight. Note, however, that to lure a beast into a trap, first its tastes and behaviors ye must know. As for forktails, bait them thusly: pound a stake in the soil, bind a goat to it, then hide ye in nearto shrubbery posthaste. The beast, lured by the caprine odor, will without fail soon come. If it is a griffin ye seek to slay, take ye buckthorn from deep water. The mighty stench of this herb is to griffins like fresh-roasted meat of the primest sort, and so come they will forthwith, though faraway they might be. Turning to drowners and water hags, it is known to all and sundry that fish and rotting mollusks are their loves, and as for trolls, common hooch is their weakness.

If anyone previously believed the ongoing war did not concern the free city, not a single resident now doubts the further course of the conflict will be determined within its walls. Our agents have confirmed earlier reports contending that King Radovid has important plans for Novigrad, and lately we have observed an increase in his agents' activity as well as the spread of his propaganda. His prime objective seems to be seizure of the wealth held by the Church of the Eternal Fire. Yet though Hierarch Hemmelfart officially rules the city, true power is in the hands of local crime lords.

Never shall I forget what I have been through… I was attacked by giant fire-breathing creatures, power monstrosities akin to drowners crossed with endregae, men with the faces of wild animals… Yet Lebioda smiled on me and saw fit to let me survive this harrying gauntlet. At its end – here, in the Hidden Chapel – I surrendered myself to meditation and immediately He filled my mind with a vision of a lake whose crystal clear waters surrounded me, penetrated my soul and cleansed it of all wickedness and villainy… when I awoke, I was certain what Lebioda had designated as the last station on my pilgrimage: the Lake of Cleansing, where Lebioda healed the bodies and spirits of his followers. <br><br>Following the advice of the sage known as the Great Beggar, in whose wisdom I basked at the Temple of Lebioda (I pray all is well with him and the people of his village have understood he only speaks the truth and means them no harm), I shall now leave behind further things binding me to my former life. Doing so is not easy, however, for acquiring these diagrams once cost me a great deal of time, energy and sacrifice. But I know this is the right path. Let Lebioda accept my humble offering.<br><br>I now continue onward, towards the Lake of Cleansing. Though my road is difficult and full of sacrifices, it grows ever more straight and clear and I feel a lightness in my soul. My certainty I walk the right path grows strong as iron, firm as steel.

   1061792|8a55e082||Responsibility for the outbreak of the first war (1263-1264) lies wholly with the Temerian Special Forces. Intercepted documents clearly show that Temeria intended to annex Cintra and moved in this direction, dealing a brazen blow to the balance of power that the Empire could not abide. Only by moving its forces into Cintra and establishing order there could the Empire preempt the Temerians’ destructive actions and safeguard peace. Sadly, the North, stubborn and short-sighted as ever, chose armed conflict over reasonable compromise.<br><br>During this conflict the forces of the Northern Realms perpetrated unpardonable atrocities, for which reprisals came first with the Battle of the Marnadal Valley and then with the Cintrian Incident. Our Imperial Majesty, Emhyr var Emreis, expressed his sympathies in a letter to the Cintrian court, adding that he hoped such horrors would never need to be repeated.<br><br>Once Cintra was taken, Nilfgaard considered the situation in the North stabilized, yet the Northern Realms fought on, bringing the situation to a head with the clash near Sodden. Nordling propaganda depicts this battle as the turning point of the war. In truth it had no political significance whatever. Shortly afterwards an armistice was signed, rendering Cintra a vassal of the Empire of Nilfgaard for all eternity.

   1206746|8bd9fc9e||Beledal: The True Story of a Poultry-Raising Genius<br><br>Malcolm Beledal came into this world in a small village to the north of Beauclair. He expressed great interest in all kinds of farming from his earliest years. He began by growing beets and onions, but soon grew bored of them, for vegetables were too inert for his energetic disposition. He then switched tracks and tried farming his friends. He locked them in an old shed and fed them hay for a week. The boys laughed at first, but soon became angry with him. Ultimately, they managed to scratch a hole in the shed’s thatch and climb out. Little Beledal’s hyperactivity finally proved useful to him then, for he had to run quite a long time before his friends finally gave up the chase. This adventure taught him an important lesson: friends make poor farm animals.<br><br>As vegetables and friends were out of question, Beledal decided to focus on animals. He started farming ants. He took a huge ant colony, put it in a bucket and placed the bucket on a window sill. Tragically, Beledal forgot it was the middle of summer and sun pounded down relentlessly. The very next morning, all the ants were roasted. Beledal ate them up, then decided to try farming bigger animals next time.<br><br>He began raising a pig, but soon took a liking to her. He named her Betsy and walked her every day. One evening, while scoffing down a braised pork knuckle, he learned it had belonged to Betsy. Oh, what torment that was for young Beledal! Desperate, he even tried to take his own life. However, after several years passed, Beledal decided to give his passion for farming one more chance. He raised a flock of chickens. They were much livelier than vegetables, considerably bigger than ants and not as intelligent as pigs. Beledal’s passion bloomed as never before. Over the years, he developed his farm so much that he became a legend.

   1077292|8bfa3978||Talaith and the Evil Witch<br><br>No one in all of Tir ná Lia knew how to help Talaith remove the evil spell cast upon her brother. Overwhelming despair clouded her judgment and she went to see an old witch. She forgot the Sages' warning that the old woman's heart was black as pitch and foul as carrion crawling with maggots.<br>The old witch lived in a cage in the wastes surrounded by poisonous vapors and venomous vipers and toads. Talaith went there, even though her pure heart cried out for her to turn back. As she approached the cave, she smelled an odor so terrible she almost fainted. She had no idea what it was - for she had never been near a human before. She overcame her disgust, thinking all the while about her brave brother, and asked the witch for help.<br>"And what will you give me in return, my dear elf?" screeched the witch.<br>"Anything you ask."<br>"Give me your voice, my dear elf, and I'll lift Leod's curse."<br>Talaith thought about how she used to sing lullabies to her little brother and began to cry, but she gave the witch her beautiful voice all the same. The old woman grabbed it in her crooked talons like a small silver fish and tossed it to her cat.<br>"Now give me your hair, my dear elf! Only then will I lift your brother's curse."<br>Talaith sobbed, but agreed, and the witch wove a thick net from her hair and hung it from the trees in order to catch birds.<br>"Now give me your eyes, my dear elf, or I'll never lift Leod's curse."<br>Talaith loved her brother very much and so gave the witch her green eyes, and the witch sewed them onto her dirty dress like precious stones for ornament. And she started to laugh. Only then did Talaith understand that the witch would never lift Leod's curse and all her sacrifices had been for nothing. But she could no longer cry. Oh, how she regretted not having listened to the Sages, who tell so many tales of human treachery!<br>Talaith was petrified with regret, but her pure heart continued beating. When the old woman bent over her book of spells, Talaith's green eyes read along with her and in this way Talaith learned it was the witch who had put the curse on her brother Leod. She read along with the witch further until she learned how to lift curse. And so she caught fat robins with the net the witch had woven from her hair and fed them to the witch's cat. Purring with delight, the cat agreed to follow her back to Tir ná Lia. There it told the Sages the whole story about Talaith's stolen voice, and they recognized that it was true.<br>The evil spells cast on Leod and Talaith were reversed, and the evil witch was drawn and quartered.

   1205928|8c40c73e||During the reign of Duchess Caroberta, Toussaint was visited by a certain disciple of the Prophet Lebioda named Plegmund. His words and deeds – which included miracles – were so persuasive, soon nearly the entire duchy had converted to the new faith. They crowned this outburst of religiosity with the construction of a temple dedicated to the prophet, but that was not enough for Plegmund. He convinced the duchess to build a statue of Lebioda - the likes of which the world had never seen.

   1223119|8cf75a43||Dear O.<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. Beware the beings that lurk the mine. Took them for plague spirits of some type at first, but they behaved all too human, just stupefied in some strange way. A novel ghoul species? Wraiths? A manifestation of concentrated suffering? Whatever the case, they haven't tried to hurt me (much). Still, I advise caution.<br><br>Watch for the ones pierced by nails - they seem especially dangerous. Was forced to kill one when it attacked. I assumed it was a ghoul, but its viscera were fully and undeniably human. That said, most of the organs were badly damaged - symptoms of a blood fever. Couldn't understand how he was still alive. I suspect now it must have been some form of possession - something that twisted his form, and then - for reasons unknown - departed. I gathered samples our mentors ought to see. Have I discovered a new species? Curious to hear your thoughts.<br><br>Reinald<br><br>PS - I put Master Alger's hypothesis to the test on some of them. He was right. Scattered salt has no effect – only a complete enclosure seems to hold them in place. But it must be complete – pure salt, no gaps – for it to work properly.

   1057884|8d07478e||Legend states that Clan Brokvar, based on the isle of Spikeroog, was founded by Sove. This hero took as his wife the lovely yet extremely quarrelsome Ulula. He tried countless ways to tame her, but no matter what lengths he went to, he could not get along with her. Finally he sailed to Hindarsfjall to meditate in Hindar, the hallowed grove. Hemdall and Freya took pity on him and gave him the formula for a potion that would grant him Understanding. They also instructed him to take a new approach, do something he had never done before, to resolve his conflicts with his wife. In order to gather the required ingredients, Sove had to kill a monster, climb the highest mountain in the isles and dive into the deepest undersea chasm. Then he prepared the potion, quaffed it and, searching for another approach to the conflict, began meditating while hanging from the tree<i>Irminsul</i>by one leg. In this manner he achieved enlightenment, and returned to Spikeroog to live with Ulula in peace and harmony to the end of their days.

   1185221|8d486f17||It all went off without a hitch. Bartolomé de Launay proved a poncy fool, just like I thought. Witcher fell right into our trap, too – put too much stock in his skills, thought he could handle anything. At first we acted like bored thugs, just picking our noses and waiting for our pay. When de Launay and the witcher finally came to terms, the witcher let slip he was hiding the rest of the diagrams in the Pits of Brume. Dangerous place, that, but maybe we’ll find some safe route to the witcher’s cache.<br><br>One bolt from the black took care of de Launay. Expected more trouble from the witcher, so we hit him with a couple – good thing, too, because he still had a good heap of life in him, though he couldn’t even get up off his belly. I let the lads check just how much pain a witcher can stomach. They’d earned a bit of recreation after the fine job they’d done. Then we grabbed the coin of de Launay and soon we’re off to the Pits of Brume to get those precious diagrams and sell for all we can.

   1205920|8dc25efc||To listen to the old folks’ jabber, this place was once home to Whispess – a woodland witch eager to help any in need. When Whispess peered into a certain knight’s heart, she saw that it was black and refused him aid. The knight reacted with wrath and burned the witch alive in her cave. Soon afterward, the knight went mad and killed himself – claiming he was tortured by a strange voice whispering in his ear that no one else could hear.

I know no name for the sense with which I perceive it. When I near its bounds, strange shivers shoot down my spine. This is not pain, but something that stands my hair on edge like a hedgehog’s quivers.<br><br>A month has passed, and still I stay within the runic circle. Nightmares prey on me more and more. I’ve come to fear sleep. I know not how long I can withstand this.<br><br>I dreamt I had a daughter. This was strange, for I’ve never had children, yet one came to me in my sleep. She was no older than ten. She called me “daddy” and loved me deeply. I could see it in her eyes. The strangest part of all was that I also burned for her with a great paternal love. Can one possibly dream of someone who does not exist? Can one love such a one?<br><br>I no longer fear sleep. Perhaps O’Dimm has decided to give me peace. I have no desire to change his mind.<br><br>My dreams of Amelie give me great joy. My daughter is a good and clever girl. I believe she will grow into a wonderful woman. A shame she exists only in my dreams. Not only do I no longer fear sleep, but now I cannot wait for the moment in which it comes. What a fantastic transformation! If nothing changes, I shall soon try to leave the circle.<br><br>I know now why I dreamt for weeks of the child I never had. It was his doing. This night my daughter died. She caught a strange illness which pocked her whole body with hideous, oozing sores. She cried, begging me to help. I could do nothing. She died in my arms. I awoke soaked with sweat. I remain a wreck, my mind tattered.<br><br>Three months have passed since Amelie’s death. My heart still bleeds, and horrifying visions plague my every moment. I’m a blind man who wishes he saw nothing, for utter blindness would be a relief compared to these tormenting visions.<br><br>I cannot persevere much longer. I have become a deeply unhappy old man.<br><br>I have now lived within the magic circle for a year. Thoughts of suicide haunt my mind ever more often. It would be so simple – I need but step outside the runes…
   1061814|8de4bdcb||Unlike in the First War against Nilfgaard, there was no clear aggressor at the start of the second conflict. In early 1267 the kings of the North met at Hagge to prepare a plan for Cintra's reconquest. Foreseeing their intentions, Emperor var Emreis amassed a large expeditionary force on the Temerian border. He then masterminded a series of events that left the North ripe for invasion - a mages' revolt erupted on Thanedd Island, and Redania descended into chaos after King Vizimir was assassinated. All Emhyr needed now was a pretext, which he got when supposedly Aedirnian soldiers attacked the Nilfgaardian frontier fortress known as Glevitzingen. Armed with this excuse, Nilfgaardian forces marched north and thus began the second war.<br><br>During the war's first phase, the imperial offensive quickly swept across the North. The empire's army started by occupying southern Lyria. Rivia was next to fall, after a short siege. Then came the Battle of Aldersberg, followed by Menno Coehoorn's march into Vengerberg. King Henselt of Kaedwen seized this opportunity to dismember his neighbor and promptly signed a treaty with Nilfgaard partitioning Aedirn between them. Opportunistic elves also joined the empire's cause and for their trouble gained an independent realm in Dol Blathanna. King Foltest was the next rat to scurry from the sinking ship, signing a truce with Nilfgaard and grabbing for himself a portion of western Aedirn. Abandoned by his allies and left with the rump of his kingdom, Demavend, ruler of Aedirn, fled to seek shelter in Redania.<br><br>The war's first stage ended and its second stage began when Nilfgaard broke its truce with Temeria after a mere fortnight and two days. Its forces immediately entered Brugge and Sodden, and soon both lands were awash in blood. In short order Emhyr occupied all of southern Temeria and shattered Foltest’s troops at Maribor. The shrewd emperor then retreated for the winter to Sodden, where he prepared for a renewed offensive come spring.<br><br>No war in history saw such fierce battles as were waged during the great Temerian offensive undertaken over those fair spring days. The forces of the North, united at last, proved a worthy opponent and slowed the Nilfgaardian advance. This provided Emhyr's internal enemies with an opening to set in motion a plot designed to depose him. Weakened by the infighting (known as the Conspiracy of Nobles), the myth of its invincibility shattered, Nilfgaard then saw its mightiest army routed by northern forces near Brenna. The tide of war had clearly turned.<br><br>Thus began the war's fourth and final phase. The North embarked on a counter-offensive, forcing the Imperial Army into a slow and bloody retreat. It was only a matter of time before armistice talks began, temporary truce lines were drawn, and the war drew to a close. Delegates from all parties to the conflict convened in Cintra to draft a peace treaty and establish a new world order. On the 2nd of April, 1268, the Peace of Cintra was signed, bringing to an end the Second War against Nilfgaard.

   1069038|8e16761f||Chapter 1.<br><br>More than curds!<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, tyromancy does not only consist of cutting cheese and examining the result. Adherents of this ancient but now forgotten and unfairly disregarded branch of the divining arts know that the slice and peek, as we call it, is only the beginning.<br><br>Once a student has mastered the fundamentals of first degree tyromancy, he should be encouraged to better his olfactory capabilities, with the aid of magic, if needs be. Once he has made satisfactory progress in this regard, he should be confronted with a well-aged and thoroughly-ripe blue cheese, preferably in an enclosed space. The first days of this training might prove stormy. Discipline is especially vital at this stage - by no means should you respond to the student’s pleas and open the larder doors.<br><br>Chapter 2.<br><br>On the superiority of tyromancy<br><br>Though tyromancy’s advantages vis a vis the other forms of divining are self-evident to me, I have gone to the trouble of a thorough comparison of its results and can with great certitude say that cheese-induced visions are much more reliable than, say, those brought about by chiromancy, aleuromancy or the current craze, rumpology (those interested in that may refer to "Rumpology – the Art of Divining from Buttocks. With Illustrations!" by Artorius Viggo).

I hope the lesser evil is true and you are busy preparing for the heist – and not avoiding me…<br><br>I believe, I want to believe, that this entire matter is about something more than mere gold and mid-life hunger for adventure, but either way I would much prefer you abandoned it. Surely you can find another way to solve your old friend’s problem. We both know quite a few folk in Novigrad, many of whom owe us favors. Perhaps it's time to call them in? Think it over - before you get in too deep…

   1055943|92fdbf8d||One is hard-pressed to think of a creature more hard-working and better organized than the endrega. Ants, bees and termites are no match for them in this regard. Endregas best even humans when it comes to foresightedness and industry.<br><br>In fact, the human race could benefit a great deal from following their example, resigning from the primitive and obsolete social structures of feudalism and adopting instead a form of arachnocommunism.<br><br>In arachnocommunism, every individual has a specific place and performs a specific labor for the common good. The roles are as follows: worker, soldier and queen. Each comrade contributes to the necessary daily toil according to his special abilities, and takes from the common fund of wealth according to his special needs.

I know you buried Selina at the Beauclair cemetery along with the rest of the loot from our last heist. Remember, we deserve a cut of that, too. So don’t be an idiot. We all know you were her lover, but remember she was also the leader of our gang, and that’s what really counts. We never got our share for knocking over that jeweler Maathenberg’s shop, so burying Selina with all the loot is pure jackassery! Those treasures belong to us all.

   1194399|938378dc||As per your orders, Filibert, we joined Conrad Veidt’s “expedition.” A truly dense fool, that one. Set out from Caravista meaning to reach Lan Exeter on his own – and best part is, he wasn’t going to do any trading along the way! Said he’d made a bet with some pals that he could reach his goal in less than eighty days.<br><br>His wagon was chock full of supplies, along with an altogether weighty trunk of Nilfgaardian florens attached to the coach box. We drank and ate all night at the Pheasantry, on his coin. I’ve still got heartburn. Didn’t hesitate a moment before agreeing to let us join him on his journey. Our suggestion to pitch camp outside the city didn’t raise the slightest suspicion. Near finished the job without even getting our hands dirty, but alas… Zuëzan swung the hammer a bit too weakly, skull didn’t crack at once, and even though that cretin was drunk as a lord, he howled bloody murder and spooked the horses. To make things worse, they were already harnessed, so they dragged the wagon straight into the lake.<br><br>We’re eager to get the blazes out of here quick as possible, because this place is crawling with those bleeding knights errant and Ducal Guardsmen, but as if out of spite, the wagon’s got stuck in the mud… [a large ink blot renders the rest of the report illegible]

   1076204|9425bfc3||Day 237<br><br>My experiments continue to return results I must consider unreliable. Methodological errors are not at fault. The problem lies in the shoddy and fallible research material I am forced to work with. Despite his prior assurance, Vserad is unable to provide me with enough moderately healthy specimens for my tests. Most of the material is starved and terrified, having been dragged here straight from the dungeon. I waste a great deal of time daily washing and delousing them before I will so much as let them step foot into my laboratory. Sterility first.<br><br>As Marti Sodergren managed to prove in her little-known work, the attitude of a patient undergoing treatment can have a significant impact on the battle against the disease. Unfortunately the volunteers with which I am supplied do not show sufficient comprehension - let alone enthusiasm - for the noble work in which they are taking part. In fact, it seems they consider the research part of their punishment. I have tried a few times (though I am but a poor speaker) to convince them that they are contributing to the eradication of one of the greatest plagues tormenting mankind. I had the distinct impression they understood little, but perhaps their stupor was merely the result of the early stages of the illness.<br><br>Of course, it is impossible to achieve success without significant sacrifices. The overwhelming majority of them will have to lay down their trifling lives on the altar of learning. But that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

   1076251|95da9862||Day 346<br><br>I never did like rats. Not because of their obscene tails, but rather on account of their lively, disturbing intelligence. They are always listening when a man believes he is talking only to himself. And, what's worse, they seem to understand.<br><br>A few days ago, I caught myself talking to one of them - to a particularly large, black male with a torn-off ear. At first I was overcome by panic. Was this a first manifestation of the illness? Of course, that was impossible, for I had fortified my immunity with powerful spells. Upon further consideration, I concluded it was an altogether natural reflex, one even the most learned among us find hard to restrain. We mages like to be listened to.<br><br>I placed the black rat in a separate cage. The time will come for it to play a part in the tests. Meanwhile, it can "keep me company." And observe. I've noticed it looks with great concentration at the cages of its infected brethren, particularly those in the last stages of illness. Fascinating.<br><br>Speaking of company - I have none, besides the black rat, and cannot hope for better. Vserad avoids the laboratory and has expressed his desire for his daughter to steer clear of me as well. At first I thought he feared a moral scandal - which would be risible in the extreme - but he explained the true reason in due course. It seems Anabelle has always possessed a fragile psychic constitution. Observing the ill might throw her into foul humors.<br><br>The peasants taking part in the study have stopped speaking to me. I don't know what they believe this little act of defiance will serve. It does me no harm - they made for lousy conversation partners. There remains, of course, The Woman, but as for her, I try to limit my contact.<br><br>Day 362<br><br>My black rat has died - today I found him curled up in his cage. I suspected he had become infected on accident, but during the autopsy I did not uncover any signs of illness. He was also perfectly well-fed. Strange. From a medical point of view his death remains unexplained, something which, I must admit, irritates the scholar in me. But, as mentioned previously, I'm not particularly fond of rats.

   1082204|96dac2d6||A dozen years ago a hermit lived here who brewed excellent mead. The witchers would visit him from time to time and chat about far-off lands.
   1186976|96e02a92||[Thick journal written in a steady hand. The last pages, however, contain different handwriting, full of blots and crossed-out words]<br><br>A mysterious gentleman has come to me asking whether I would agree to sell him the stock of barrels we are preparing for the new wine variety. I refused him curtly, for I know how much the new wine means to Miss Matilda. And how much depends on this wine’s success. After all, things have been very tight at the vineyard these last days…<br><br>This extremely mysterious gentleman has turned out to be equally extremely wealthy. He came to me again with a very hefty pouch… Bum-blast it, it will be very hard to refuse him if he puts me to that trial again.<br><br>Today I forgot to lock the gates to the barrel storehouse. I’m very ashamed… but what could I do? Miss Matilda is crushed. I won’t touch that coin until all has settled down. I’ve hidden a sack stuffed with Nilfgaardian florens in the sunflower fields. I would not want someone to find such a fortune in my home.<br><br>He has paid me another visit. This time he wanted me to procure him the recipe for the new wine. I do have some honor, barrels are one thing – I can make new ones, perhaps even better ones – but the recipe for the wine… I said I’d sooner die, and then he gave me this strange look… sent shivers down my spine. I think I’d best barricade my doors this night…

   1207206|96f47e8c||26th of July<br>Unsure where to start a dig? Ask the nearest old washwoman. Or old men whittling by the road. They know everything! Yes, yes, I know, it takes a great deal of patience and you have to separate the wheat from the chaff, but it’s the best way to learn about local legends. That’s how we came to find Fox Hollow, where they say the soil sprouts clay pots (!).<br><br>28th of July<br>We dug up part of a vineyard on the outskirts of Fox Hollow, but what we found there… those were not pots, those were elven funeral urns! It seems the village is built atop an ancient Aen Siedhe necropolis... That cemetery dates, by my reckoning, to the time before the First Landing, so the graves might be full of valuables. The ancient elves buried their dead along with great wealth. We’ve already dug up a few choice baubles, but I’m sure if we look deeper we will find much more.<br><br>12th of August<br>Today we started a new dig, in a new location. Matthias spied a beautifully ornamented cameo in the ground, and when he tried to grab it… he discovered it was clenched in the hands of a skeleton. Anselm started to mock him, but quickly lost all desire to laugh. The valley was full of elven skeletons – men, women, even children... The bodies were all mixed, with limbs lopped off, many heads missing and children with crushed rib cages… what happened here?!<br><br>14th of August<br>Another sleepless night. Blood, cries, wails… I awake drenched in sweat, then I doze off for a moment and the same happens again. I told my fellows to dig a deep hole We’ll throw that cursed cameo inside – it belongs in the ground, with the rest of the dead.<br><br>16th of August<br>Matthias disappeared during the night. No one saw him leave camp, his things are all in place… Anselm says we should follow his example and flee while we still live, but I… I cannot leave it like this! This valley is full of bones… Anselm screamed in my face, called me a madman, but I MUST tell someone what we have found. They say there is a group of archeologists from Castel Graupian at the Termes ruins… [rest is covered in blood]

A father who must abandon his own child ceased to be a father, and his heart shall never know comfort. Sadly, as a result of what has happened I have no other choice. We, along with the rest of the household, must abandon our estate.

For my part I can only promise each year I will send an envoy who will be tasked with checking in on you, seeing if you are alive and, if so, in what form. Faith that you will once again be my beloved Marlene gives me the strength to live on. Perhaps the curse will not last forever. Perhaps someone will come along you can lift this burden from you.<br><br>Farewell.<br><br>Your Loving Father

   1206235|984c057e||The fiendish slurpers of blood—the vampyres, so-called—the dead and yet alive, called by others—are cunning beasts—verily, some suspect they even reason and converse—yet beasts they remain. These vampyres lead solitary existences—even their beastly and abominable ilk, they shun. The bloodslurpers are not idly named, for the blood of other beings is their bread. They hack apart their victims with sharp claws—daggers, in truth, though of one with their flesh. Upon feasting thus they grow in foul force and can turn into flying rats—gaining these animals’ keen hearing and also a sense of smell to match that of hound or hind.<br> <br>It is our luck seasoned hunters of bloodslurpers know ruses with which to trick these horrors and slay them without excessive risk. To kill a vampire easily and surely, it is enough to lure him into the light of the sun. He will then disintegrate into a fine dust at once, ready to be scattered to the four corners of the earth by the next gust. Yet well-advised is it to further equip oneself with garlic, lest the horror crawl too close and strike out at the hunter with its dagger-claws. Vampyres fear garlic with all-consuming terror—the mere smell of it reduces them to violent heaving and sobbing. In this moment should the hunter pound into the beast’s heart a sharpened stake—the second best weapon (the first being the sun) for the killing of the bloodslurpers.

Mankind is threatened. The prophesied destruction by the White Frost is not just the babbling of some mad she-elf. Perhaps I will have the opportunity to convince you of this in person. If not, I must rely on this letter, which you will read many years from now, at a time when you know more than you did when we first met.<br><br>Know that nothing will save the world except preparing its entire population for this catastrophe.

   1210276|99891ad1||Report on Knight Errantry Activities in the Duchy of Toussaint E26/g/21/ul/1271<br><br>By decision of the ducal camerlengo, full and unfettered access to the Basane Farm (an administrative unit in the Champs-Désolés) shall heretofore be restored. Said farm had previously been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of the current owner – Countess Tiphaine Baudet de Sakhor. This designation was based on reports of the presence of an unrecognized monster in the lands of said estate.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster determined to be a lycanthrope (species: werewolf, W3 classification: cursed creature). The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 25% to take into account swordplay making use of more than one weapon and immediate payment in species.

"But my heart doth long with fiercer passion for yon werewolf, whom thou hatest with all thy vampiric thouness."<br><br>"'Tis for the best," spoke Edward, shifting his pale face towards the equally pale moon. "With me thy life was ever endangered. With yon werewolf thou shalt know peace and happiness."<br><br>Edward turned around and took a step towards the exit, but Isabella grabbed his wrist and bade he stop. The touch of her hand was so tender, his heart newly began to beat anew after centuries of deathly stillness.<br><br>"There is more," spoke she, averting his penetrating gaze. "I am with child."

   1058251|99ad6d35||My thoughts turn with increasing frequency to the idea of capturing a djinn. If I could just harness its power… there is much I would gain. Amos var Ypsis' tome confirms what I have long suspected - that, despite my failure to do so previously, taming a djinn is, in fact, possible.<br><br>According to var Ypsis, the difficulties involved in bending such a being to one's will can be overcome. He managed to do so, at the least.<br><br>Alas, this does not mean his methods will necessarily be useful to me - each djinn is different, each case requires a singular approach. I've more experience unraveling such magic riddles than almost anyone else alive, and if Geralt, with his talent for wrestling unruly magic beings, agrees to help, we just might find a way to do it. The problem is we must first find a djinn, a daunting task unto itself…

   1061789|99d66d40||<i>Childhood and Early Manhood</i><br><br>Though the Nilfgaardian throne was his by right of birth, it would be many long years before Emhyr var Emreis sat upon it. When he was but thirteen, an uprising engulfed the empire’s capital. A usurper seized power, overthrowing Emhyr’s father, Fergus var Emreis, who then refused to grant legitimacy to the coup. The usurper then decided he would break Fergus by having mages torture his son and heir, Emhyr. He failed in his plan, was forced to kill Fergus, and Emhyr escaped, presumably to a land beyond the empire's borders.<br><br>No reliable accounts of the emperor's actions in exile exist. Some claim he fell into the company of a knight errant, serving as his squire. This seems plausible enough, though the tales about the eccentric knight's proclivity to charge at windmills must surely be storytellers' exaggerations. A few unreliable reports claim a connection between Emhyr and the fabled Urcheon of Erlenwald who saved the life of King Roegner of Cintra. This seems far less likely, for it is public record that when the witcher Geralt of Rivia lifted the Urcheon's curse, he was revealed to be a duke named Duny, who later wed Roegner's daughter, Pavetta, and perished at her side when their ship went down at sea.<br><br>What is known for certain is that around the time of this great tragedy for the kingdom of Cintra, Emhyr reappeared in the empire and led a revolt to overthrow the usurper and restore his own birthright. Soon after he led the empire's armies in their successful conquest of Cintra, setting a tone of determined military expansion that would endure through the rest of his reign.

In my opinion, there’s no point you waiting for the new owner. The procedures involved in transferring such an important vineyard will last months, and meanwhile the estate will fall into ruin. You wrote you had to fire all the vineyard’s guards – who will now protect you from wild animals? You know full well how many of them lurk in the Caroberta Woods! They could attack you at any moment! I worry for you. I’ve already spoken to Master Fabricio and he thinks a skilled steward such as yourself will quickly find work over here. So stop playing the hero and come join me. <br><br>I await your imminent (I hope!) arrival,<br><br>Your Loving Cousin Emille<br>Castel Ravello

The ripened curd can be white or blue, hard or soft, fresh or aged, from the milk of cows, sheep or goats, brined, pickled or untouched... This list could go on till the end of time! And each of them, every last slice, every morsel and crumb, not only brings with it an unmatched rush of sensory experience, but in the right hands can be made to reveal the universe's most closely-guarded secrets.<br><br>For cheese, like the innards of sacrificed animals, the flight of a swallow or vivid dreams, can be used for divination. The depth and size of a cheese's holes reveal when rains will fall in the coming year, while the color of mold veins tells who shall love whom, and the scent of a hard grana padano predicts which army will vanquish its foes and which shall perish.<br><br>The best divination, however, is done using the ancient method of fondue. One must simply melt two different kinds of cheese, preferably emmental and gruyere, in white wine or, in a pinch, in a dry apple cider. Then one must use a long stick to immerse a morsel of bread in the resultant thick soupy mixture, all the while keeping in mind the question, "What shall my child be like when he (or she, as the case may be) grows?" Then bring the cheese-covered morsel of bread up to a candle, so that it casts a shadow on the wall: the shape will provide a sure and easily understood answer to your query.

They are not, however, capable of utilizing more complex spells - indeed, they treat real magic with reserve and distrust. Widespread in their ranks is an irrational, nigh onto superstitious fear of teleportation (let me remind you that deadly accidents during translocational travel occur only once per one hundred instances of such travel!).<br><br>This aversion surely stems from the fact that witchers do not possess inborn magic talents, but instead gain them during their infamous Trial of the Grasses.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at the Silver Salamander Inn – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the ruins of Arthach Palace. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Antoine Straggen, wanted by writ of law in Metinna, Gheso and Nazair, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 40% to take into account the tax on unsyndicated butchers and immediate payment in species.

   1076376|9d09250e||On one occasion Muriel went on a journey to see her auntie in Maribor accompanied by her nursemaid. Their path took them through a forest, and in this forest lived a raucous troupe of bandits. This infamous group was led by Flynn Selms, and all the king's men had been unable to bring them to justice. Alas, such was Muriel's great misfortune that these bandits chose to attack her carriage.<br><br>Muriel's nursemaid was old, blind and deaf. She did not wake when a tree fell in front of their carriage with a loud thud, nor when the bandits fought a fierce battle against their guardsmen. When Flynn ripped open the carriage door with his muscular arms and stepped inside, Muriel had to deal with the danger herself. "Make our guest comfortable, young lady," the old nursemaid muttered in her sleep. Muriel obediently carried out her instructions.

   1122952|9dd05734||[Notebook documenting research undertaken for the dissertation “On the Workings and Construction of Golems, Based on the Work of Master Alzur,” written by Igor de Sade, a student at the Ban Ard Academy. Only a portion of the notes have survived.]<br><br>Day 134<br>I came across the remains of a destroyed golem in the swamps outside Vizima… Words cannot describe the rage that overcame me. The brickmakers who  keep a settlement nearby told me this act of vandalism was perpetrated by some white-haired witcher. I had heard the members of that guild were vile whoresons, but to stoop to that!<br><br>Day 163<br>The idea struck me that I might find something of use in the Oxenfurt Academy archive. I managed, with great difficulty, to cross the Pontar, but once in Oxenfurt I met with an unpleasant surprise – the Academy has been closed! Luckily I was able to gain entry thanks to the help of a professor acquaintance of mine (thank you, Slavoy!). I thus was able to dig out a few dust-covered beauties and… eureka! Near the village of Heddel there’s a tower which (purportedly) once served as a workshop to none other than Master Alzur himself!<br><br>Day 164<br>I made it to the tower. It’s inhabited. A rather eccentric gentleman has made it a roost for his flock of... harpies. I saw him feed their chicks pork! Inconceivable! But let’s return to our core concern. The tower which this loon has turned into a harpy nest truly might have once been Alzur’s workshop. That means this might be the very place where he conducted his research into golems… <br><br>Day 165<br>It’s here! Standing motionless in a stone circle! The local peasants think it’s merely a strangely-formed boulder, but then again, how could such bumpkins ever guess they pass a masterpiece of magic construction on the way to feed their chickens! I’ve already fastened a lightning conductor. It's a shame there are no druids nearby. If I hadn’t slept through my course on meteorological magic, I’d summon a storm myself, but as it is, I can but wait, patiently or otherwise…<br><br>Day 171<br>Been sitting on these cold stones waiting for a change in the weather so long my bowels have almost frozen, but it’s finally here! I must stop writing now for drops are falling on my notebook and smearing my notes. The first rumblings of thunder sound in the distance! I cannot contain my excitement. Soon, the golem shall live again!

   1061984|9ee17bbd||Human life requires three things for its sustenance - food, drink and gossip. It is thus no wonder that no matter where I travel, be it ice-bound Poviss or ever green Toussaint, everyone asks me about the passions that bind Geralt and the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. As a man both cautious and discreet, I refuse to betray their secrets - with one important exception. The history of their first encounter is so extraordinary, so romantic and moving, that it would be a veritable crime to hide its light beneath a bushel basket. Indeed, had I not witnessed these events in person, I would never believe there was room in our grim and dark world for such fantastic marvels.<br><br>It all began when Geralt and I were feeling a bit peckish and, unburdened by heavy coin pouches, decided to fish our supper out of a lake. No bites were to be had, but we did not leave empty-handed - my hook snagged quite a lovely little pot. Oblivious to my friend's warnings, I opened it - and in doing so freed a powerful djinn.<br><br>Without giving it much thought I set about proclaiming my wishes. Before I could get to three, however, the djinn - irritated, I see now in hindsight, at being issued demands so soon after waking - began to throttle me. Geralt was able to drive him off, but I was left in a sorry state. I acted, the witcher told me later, as though under the influence of some curse. Clearly, the help of an expert in the magic arcana would be needed.<br><br>It was our good fortune that Yennefer of Vengerberg happened to be staying in a nearby village. Geralt went to her to ask that she heal his best friend, who happened also to be the brightest star in the North's poetic firmament. Yennefer, however, was more interested in the djinn (which she wanted to trap into magic servitude) than in its victim, and, it should be said, played the witcher like a well-strung mandolin. Yet rather than grow angry at being used in such a calculating manner, he fell white head over muddy boots in love with her.<br><br>What happened then… well, I won't go into details, suffice to say that Yennefer's plans hardly delighted the djinn, and without its cooperation she proved unable to tame it. The sorceress would surely have met a tragic end - and taken all of Rinde along with her - had Geralt not rushed to her rescue. For once, he did not need to draw either of his blades: to send the djinn packing, he had but to pronounce the third and final wish. He could have asked for anything: wealth, fame, power… but instead he asked the djinn to bind his fate to that of the arrogant yet intriguing sorceress from Vengerberg.<br><br>Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, born 1232.

   1077310|9ee360bf||When Auberon Muircetach died, we lost not only our finest Sage and leader, but also our best chance to renew the gene of the Elder Blood. Prior to this, success seemed possible, even imminent. I had interpreted Cirilla's willingness to attempt to beget his child - despite her earlier resistance - as a personal triumph and a sign there was more of Lara in her than I had ever imagined possible.<br>Now, with all my designs shattered and the benefit of hindsight, I have concluded that putting pressure on her then in Tir ná Lia had a very negative effect on our relationship. Yet I could not have predicted that Muircetach had so little time remaining, and would squander it so foolishly, even though Cirilla was his for the taking.<br>Now my only hope lies in trying to regain her confidence and trust at any cost.
   1087431|9eedd515||The smallest of the Skellige Isles is also the birthplace of the islander's culture. Skelligers believe themselves direct descendants of Otkell, a legendary hero who was the first practitioner of the cult of Freya in the isles. He erected a beautiful temple in honor of the goddess on Hindarsfjall (sadly the temple has been closed to visitors in recent years due to concerns about the possible theft of the famous diamond, Brisingamen, ornamenting the goddess' statue). Otkell also constructed a fantastic garden near the temple - this can still be visited upon making prior arrangements with the priestesses' mother superior.<br><br>An enticing option for those wishing to visit Hindarsfjall is the package excursion offered by the congregation of Freya worshippers in Poviss. Thanks to a longstanding agreement with the isle's priestesses, they can offer tours of all the local highlights at a very reasonable price. This is by far the best option for families with children or the elderly.

Not for taking my life, but for taking from me the one who gave my life meaning.<br><br>If anyone ever finds my remains and this letter, please, seek out my sister, Dolores Reardon, and tell her the truth – that I was killed by the man who seduced her, the man she left me for, the scoundrel Roderick of Gors Velen. He struck me from behind, dragged me here and then walled me in while I lay unconscious. He did not even have the courage to slit my throat.<br><br>Yet, despite it all… I hope he brings her happiness – if so, I will rest in peace… But if he fails her, my ghost will haunt him to the end of his miserable life, and he will die as I have – alone and forgotten.

Still others he placed amidst the rocks on the shore of the valley's lake.

A further manifestation of the stupidity born of superstition is faith in the supposedly supernatural abilities of dreaming hags, who proudly style themselves oneiromancers. These mendacious persons convince the unwashed rabble they are able not only to dream the unknown past, but also to see the future yet to come as they sleep. Why, the very audacity of this talk inspires one to be ever more unyielding in our efforts to weed out this vermin. The City of Novigrad will soon be free of all sort of black magic, that worked by dreamers included.

   1209022|a2d5a8a5||For many years, it was erroneously believed slyzards were simply wyverns in their highest stage of development. One “scholar,” whose completion of an academic course of study must have been the result of no small miracle, heatedly defended this point of view in a “scientific” work whose title I shall mercifully withhold. His main line of reasoning was an absurd and completely off the mark parallel drawn between the developmental cycles of the slyzard and pieris brassicae, also known as the cabbage butterfly. “A slyzard” – claimed the author – “is nothing but a fully mature wyvern that has developed fire glands.”<br><br>Utter rubbish! Let it be known once and for all that Charles von Linné is a filthy fopdoodle and an uneducated knucklehead - a slyzard is not by any means the same beast as a wyvern!

The once wealthy Redanian family's manor and lands were auctioned off after they fell deeply in debt, but were returned to von Everec hands by Olgierd, the infamous leader of an informal band of armed men calling themselves the Redanian Free Company. Despite the effort he went through to regain it, Olgierd abandoned the residence some time later, and dark legends concerning it now circulate among its neighbors.

In short, a scholar for damned certain. We showed him the diagram and asked nicely what’s written there. He said he didn’t rightly know, but looked like Ofieri or some other such strange tongue. Naturally we warmed his sides a bit, to see if that wouldn’t happen to aid his reading, but the blasted weakling went and died on us. Still, seems now that--

   1190170|a39e102a||Dear Martina Crisca,<br><br>Congratulations on being promoted to the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian. I’m sure you’ll quickly become one of that institution’s premier scholars! Yet before you set off for Nilfgaard, I, old Victor Monnart, would like to ask you for a small favor. You know my sons, you played together as children – so you know how hard it is to coax them to get along. I feel in my bones it will soon come time for me to leave this vale of tears, yet I shall go with a heavy heart knowing Auguste, Hugo and Lucien will go at each other’s throats as soon as I pass. Thus I have dismantled my famed still into three parts and ask you, my darling Martina, to hide them from my sons. Perhaps searching together for the missing pieces of a machine which will give them wealth will bind them together and forever put an end to these foolish quarrels. In exchange for your trouble, I have included a modest pouch of coin. I wish you good luck!<br><br>Your Devoted Servant,<br>Victor Monnart

   1185301|a3c0d60d||The witcher I summoned reached Ussar on the 12th of September. He made a favorable impression. I had expected a cold killer, yet found myself speaking with someone who could easily be mistaken for a normal man – if not for his expansive knowledge concerning the habits of monsters, the two swords on his back and the griffin-head medallion on his chest. Jerome, as he was called, asked me a great many questions about the beast seen near Mont Crane castle. Based on my responses he concluded the monster in question was a leshen.<br><br>During our next conversation the witcher expressed his astonishment at being offered such a high reward, and one paid in advance, before he even arrived in Toussaint. I had taken a liking to the fellow and wanted to be honest with him. Despite the vow I had sworn, I revealed his pay came entirely from a certain Moreau, a mage, who had decided to use this gift to thank our community for a warm welcome.<br><br>When Jerome heard the mage’s name, he first went pale, then flew into a rage. He shouted, and I quote: “Gonna give that old bastard a piece of my mind!”,  then ran to the stables, mounted his steed and rode off, leaving the greater part of his possessions behind. He was seen on the road to Mont Crane, but then disappeared, like a rock thrown in deep water. Master Moreau claims he never saw the witcher.

   1209017|a3e3730e||As a young adept of the art of medicine, I was once asked by my mentor, Nurse Hatched, to gather some herbs needed for poultices.<br><br>I set out for the woods and sought ripe specimens, when all of a sudden a juniper shrub began to swish and shake! "It must be a leshen or another monster of some sort, enraged by my insolent theft of the forest’s treasures!" - I thought.<br><br>Luckily, it turned out the beast was no leshen, but a little panther!<br><br>Full of pity, I decided to share the bread and dried meat I brought in my bundle with the cub.<br><br>From that moment on, I brought the panther something to eat every day, and every day it waited for me next to the juniper.<br><br>A year passed and the panther grew so big I was afraid to approach it, so I would just throw bits of meat and leave as quickly as possible.<br><br>Then a sickness left me bedridden for a month. When I was finally back on my feet, I went to the woods, to the juniper shrub. My beloved panther, now as big as a horse, only roared from afar… I bolted.<br><br>Panthers are beautiful animals and they are quite fascinating as well – but I value my life and that is that.

   1209222|a5f195b5||In the course of my research into bruxae, I have stumbled upon certain inconsistencies that in no way correspond with what we already know about these dangerous vampires. My investigations have revealed that these seemingly erroneous accounts were in fact describing an alp, not a bruxa! It is an extraordinary discovery, a true milestone in the classification of these monsters.<br><br>Even though legends tell of these vampires turning into pitch black hounds or venomous toads, personally, I do not believe an alp is capable of such polymorphy. However, it is almost certain that, similarly to a bruxa, an alp may transform itself into a beautiful woman. This ability allows the species to blend seamlessly into crowds. To think that I may have passed such a monster completely unawares – fascinating!<br><br>One of the fundamental differences between alps and bruxae is their fighting style when in the form of a vampire. Alps also possess the ability to turn into fog, which allow them to move noiselessly and attack by surprise. Most likely this is the root of the name common folk have given them: "fleetlings."

If not hostile! For whoever is not with us is against us, and the so-called “neutral” reek of cowardice and treachery.<br><br>But allow me to get to the point. Since you insist on riding to Toussaint and consorting with drunken knights, at least make good use of the opportunity and give some Nilfgaardian a good hiding. For Redania! <br><br>A Well-Wisher

Around the time of the break-in witnesses saw a thin, bald man rolling a barrel down the street and giggling to himself. The thief was also noticed to be singing a rude song in which he called himself "Odrin." If anyone knows the perpetrator's current whereabouts, they are asked to contact the injured party immediately.

   1055918|a6b552bc||Vridank the Elf<br>Despite what one might conclude from his moniker, not one drop of elven blood flowed in King Vridank's veins. They called him the Elf because of his exceptional beauty, and for the great admiration he felt for the Aen Seidhe. This fascination, seemingly harmless, would have horrible long-term consequences. King Vridank, spitting in the face of all laws and customs, chose as his wife a half-elf - and one of low status at that - known as Beatrix of Kovir. The fruit of this regrettable and short-lived mésalliance was Falka, who later fomented bloody revolt against her own father. Though this uprising was ultimately extinguished and Falka herself burned at the stake, the young state was thereafter thrown into chaos for years to come.

   1078903|a72f4fd2||Sirens, the harpies' distant relatives, are winged monsters found in the Skellige Archipelago, most frequently on unpopulated isles or in the inaccessible coastal areas of populated ones. According to legend they are daughters of the mythical winged giant Hräsvelg, who lives on the edge of the world and births gales with the waving of his wings. Hräsvelg's daughters seek out the company of giants and often make their nests near their lairs.<br><br>These creatures attack boats and ships from the air, tearing sails and rigging to shreds and rendering the vessels immobile. At times they will snatch men or cattle from the deck and drop them from great heights to their death. They also attack travelers trekking across isolated beaches.

Before they snap down from the heavens upon their prey like a divine whip, they let out a long, piercing shriek in warning, so that the victim may prepare itself for the imminent attack. Griffins do not fear to attack armed men - in fact, they prefer such prey, for defeating a knight flatters their pride. They even attack fiends, the terror of the Velen wilderness, so honorable is their nature.

Never been a jelly-kneed milksop, mind, but one look at this lot and I near soiled my hose. Why, just the other day they picked up this chap in the woods who was out gathering mushrooms, all bright eyes and innocence. After an hour of our lads having their “fun” with the fellow, he was begging to be sent to his makers. Soon as he said as much, Fourfingers pointed his remaining digits straight at me. I wasn’t surprised -- being new and all, it was only natural I had to prove my chops – but nor was I exactly eager. But what could I do? Hold my nose and slit the boy’s throat, that’s what.<br><br>Ugh, I can still feel the sickly warmth of his blood on my hands, no matter how much emulsion I use. Don’t get me wrong, I’d killed before – but always in self-defense, or at least in circumstances which a generous mind or a shrewd barrister could cast in that mold. But no barrister will do me any good if the lads find out my stomach curdled when I did the deed. Then it’s out of the club with me, and that’s the best case scenario, if Filibert’s in a lenient mood. Otherwise… why, I don’t even want to think about it.

He begged shelter for the night, claiming he'd been injured, but the baron living inside was afraid the traveler was a spy and sent him away. Little did he know the traveler was a powerful mage, who cast a curse on the tower, its inhospitable owner and all who dwelled with him. Soon thereafter the baron and all his retinue died in mysterious circumstances, and the tower fell into ruin.

    320533|aa02ac6a||Sailors give Ard Hugtand, also known as the Isle of Death, wide berth - and not without reason. Treacherous currents have cast many ships against its rocky shores, and hungry beasts inhabit the island and the surrounding waters. Though the isle’s inlets tempt them with their vast shoals of cod and salmon, even the most experienced fishermen do not dare sail near it. There are legends as numerous as they are varied, telling both of ravines filled with gold nuggets and hurricanes which whip icy, bone-rending shards across its surface. An absolute ruler has reputedly lorded over the isle for centuries, tolerating no intruders. These legends, however, remain only that, for no one who has ever ventured to Ard Hugtand has returned to deny or confirm them.

The children once detested onions, but now gobble their morsel greedily and suck on the skins. Soon our bag will be empty. We have no wood or fuel, and the snows keep falling. The mayor has been sending men door to door to hand out modest rations and a bit of wood from the lighthouse storeroom, but no one has come for days. I am not surprised. The snow is piled nearly to the top of our windows - no one could get to our door. I am afraid, so horribly afraid, that we will not outlast this winter...

A golem never wavers, hesitates or doubts, nor does it have any of the bodily needs of other creatures fit for servitude. Golems’ strength and endurance exceed that of any other humanoid being, and furthermore they do not complain, suffer from bodily aches or demand payment of any kind, requiring only the occasional bit of specialized conversation work to maintain their labor.

   1209954|ac5f1303||Dear Geralt,<br><br>If you are reading these words, it means I am already far beyond the borders of Toussaint and you have found my Mutagenerator. (Of course, you may dub this instrument however you like, perhaps something more fitting to your taste or better reflecting its function, for I have no doubt your knowledge on the subject of mutagens is far more profound and thorough than mine!)<br><br>I have been working on this device in my spare time, but now it is finished and I am convinced – as convinced as an inventor can be before his invention has been used as intended – of the usefulness of this apparatus.<br><br>You are surely wondering what function it is meant to serve. As the name indicates, the Mutagenerator generates mutagens. It operates by absorbing electromagical energy waves from bodies (in this case, the bodies of the monsters and evil-doers you kill) – and when it has absorbed enough so as to be charged a critical amount, the Mutagenerator changes the stored energy into a Greater Mutagen – which, I suspect, you will make good use of. <br><br>As you surely understand, I am an amateur engineer, which is why you must forgive the lack of an ability for you to direct this operation. Which mutagen emerges as a result is determined at random, meaning chance will decide if it is a Green, Red or Blue Mutagen. Chance – yet I have noted the colors tend to alternate, by and large.<br>I trust you shall find my gift useful.<br><br>Your dearly devoted friend,<br> Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy<br><br>P.S. You might be wondering why  I decided to toss the Mutagenerator into your home instead of simply handing it to you in person. Well, you must know I did it out of modesty. Believe it or not. <br>Take care, Geralt – and may my gift serve you well.

In such emergencies, prepare a copious container – a vat, a barrel, a bucket – anything large and watertight. Next fill it three-fourths of the way full with water (it is strongly advised not to exceed this amount, for the substance will boil as an alchemical side effect, which could lead a portion of it to spill out if the container is overfilled). The next step is to add<i>hillobarthus aurensis</i>extract, two drops for every liter of water, and then let the mixture sit for fifteen minutes. After that time has passed, apply a reverse secondary filtration formula, which by now you should be well familiar with.

Potential entrepreneurs were scared off by the bloody legend of Waltharius the Burly and since the area had never produced wines worthy of historical mention anyways, they had little incentive to conquer this fear. The estate’s most recent owner, however - a nobleman named Roderick - decided to plant vines along the slopes stretching from the Blessure and Sansretour valleys up to the keep. As a precaution, he also planted olive groves, a much surer investment.

   1025838|ae33ddfb||The reasons for choosing Jacques de Aldersberg as Grandmaster remain a mystery. The Order of the White Rose had gone through a crisis in those times and was on the verge of collapse, so one might guess that the brethren wished to have someone decisive as their leaders, someone with a clear vision. De Aldersberg was precisely such a man. One of his first decisions was to change the brotherhood's name to the Order of the Flaming Rose.<br><br>The most puzzling aspect, however, is that the order and the king himself decided to trust a man who, for all intents and purposes, had appeared out of nowhere. They say he was a wanderer, an itinerant priest who moved crowds with his speeches declaiming nonhumans. They say he worked miracles and showed his flock visions of a world destroyed by the White Frost. He was undoubtedly a man of great charisma, one instilled with unshakeable principles which he in turn tried to instill in others.<br><br>Was he truly a Source? Was he indeed gifted with raw magic talent? That we will never know for certain.

The rich man agreed to the loan on condition that the poor man return everything plus interest in seven day’s time. The sum was so large that the rich man was certain the poor man would not be able to pay it back. Then he would by law be forced to work for the rich man without pay. The poor man, however, proved the slier one – he bought warm, sturdy clothing and a strong horse, and then rode out of town.

   1209385|aec15a29||Lady Dulcinea was a noblewoman at Duchess Caroberta’s court. According to legend, whenever she appeared duels knights would duel for her favor and noblewomen would faint out of jealousy. Yet rather than accepting the advances of one of her gentlemen suitors, Lady Dulcinea, tired of the pomp of the ducal court, agreed to the proposal of a simple miller and abandoned the palace to dwell with him in his mill. Word is, she lived there happily ever after.
   1135925|aec37fe1||Bowdon was founded by writ of King Heribert the Quarrelsome. Unfortunately, the king was roaring drunk when they asked him to indicate on the map where to build the new settlement and slammed his finger down in the middle of a swamp. Those forced to settle there soon abandoned the unpleasant bog. Their empty dwellings became shelter for vagabonds and bandits.

    320539|aed7df51||Kaer Trolde is the main fortress on the isle of Ard Skellig. For centuries it has been the an Craites' seat and jarl Crach an Craite’s pride and joy. Partly carved from the solid rock of the isle’s highest mountain, it makes a strong impression on all who behold it. Legend has it it was built by Grymmdjarr Iron Fang, son of Hemdall and Heulyn, founders of Clan an Craite. Grymmdjarr wanted a way to watch over all of Skellige to ensure no harm would come to his brothers, rulers of the other islands. So he wrapped heavy chains around a mountain resting on the sea floor, pulled it to the surface and placed it on the island of Ard Skellig. In seven days he carved out of it an impregnable fortress whose lofty towers afford a view of all the archipelago.

   1078031|af4964fe||My Dearest Master Sigvard,<br>I have received your letter. I thus now know that you have a great many doubts regarding the contract I have offered you - and that you clearly suffer from gross misconceptions regarding the nature of a mercenary's trade, something which, given that this is a trade you yourself profess to practice, constitutes a highly puzzling paradox. <br><br>So let me inform you that a mercenary is not paid for asking questions or listing reservations, but for performing a concrete task. This task was described in simple, unambiguous words: you are to capture a siren - <i>alive</i> - and bring her to me. If you will not perform this task, you are of no interest to me. As to why I need this siren, or what I intend to do with her, that should not be of any interest to you. If these conditions do not suit you, I am sure I will find another man who will not refuse my coin.<br><br>-Count de Botton

I explained it was already a miracle we’d been able to live so long among men. I fear Hubert will prove unable to control his transformations while he is in such a state…<br><br>We’ve moved into a cave in the Blessure Forest. They allowed us to take a few possessions from the farm. We have a bed, a table and some candles. Things aren’t so bad! The cave is a bit damp, true, and one night in I can already tell it will play havoc with my joints…<br><br>Hubert had an attack when he heard me cough. He screamed he would return to the farm and sink his teeth in the countess... I’ve a bad feeling.<br><br>Hubert has disappeared. I’m terrified. Shivers run down my spine.

   1062216|b0341886||According to legend, Gabriella Maurienn, the founder of the Maurienn dynasty, was lover to Scarab, son of Godamba Thaess'en, progenitor of the Thyssenid dynasty. For this reason the Maurienns are considered kin to the royal dynasty, though no documents survive that confirm this blood tie with absolute certainty.<br><br>During its stormy history the Maurienn dynasty did not make very frequent use of its family ties to the court, though there were times when it did closely cooperate with it. Thus for example Franz Maurienn, grandson of Gabriella, was advisor to Guido Thyssen and his wife Klaudia of the Starhembergs. The chronicles tell us that while Franz dabbled mainly in healing and elemental magic, he also conducted experiments in necromancy. Guido Thyssen, who was fond of Franz's pleasant company and sense of humor, turned a blind eye to this. His detractors claim Franz repaid his patron several times over - as a result of the magic teas Franz would send on behalf of Guido to King Gerard Troydenid, Guido was settled in the Eastern March and given the title of margrave.

Few, however, realize the duchy’s lands are rich with deposits of slate and other valuable building materials, and that the quarrying of such was once the bedrock of local livelihoods. Thus when gods-fearing Toussaintois saw fit to build a statue of the saintly Lebioda, they had no need to send for materials from abroad – instead, they merely reactivated Ardaiso.

   1213514|b3242852||Ducal Chronicle, Tome LVI, Lammas – Saovine, 1268 [excerpts]<br><br>In the month preceding the celebrations surrounding the Festival of the Vat, the Ducal Couple and a delegation of notables embarked on a neighborly visit to the court of Queen Calanthe of Cintra. The visit had both a social and a political dimension, for the duchess was hoping Queen Calanthe would follow the dictates of international protocol and repay with a visit of her own, perferably during the above-mentioned Festival, thus gracing the celebration with her royal presence.<br><br>The ducal couple was accompanied by both daughters, Syanna and Anarietta. It is worth mentioning here that both infants are sprouting like beanpoles and it shall not belong before it will be necessary to find them husbands. In the case of the elder daughter, Syanna, this should not prove a problem, as suitors will flock from all over the civilized world for the chance to be husband to the future duchess, especially when they see her portrait, which will not even require much embellishment. Things are somewhat different in the case of young Anarietta, who is overly thin and furthermore auburn haired. The hope remains, however, that time will add to her charms. As for character and imagination, neither girl is lacking in either quality in the least.

   1207162|b33ac90d||[most entries cannot be deciphered, some pages are smeared with grease and ink blots]<br><br>Day 143<br>Now that’s what they call popularity. They’ve been coming in droves lately to join our hanse – in fact, I’ve had to start turning some away! Sadly, most of the newcomers are dung-booted jelly diddlers – send that lot to demand coin from a caravan, and even the horses would soil themselves laughing. That’s why I’ve put Carlo in charge of drilling the new recruits. He’s pitched camp to the south of Lynx Crag – that rock where the witch lives. I despise such old wenches like plaguey vapors and would gladly fix up a pyre for her, but after what happened at the Cutterin Estate… Bet my own danglies that was her doing, so we’d best leave her be.<br><br>Day 167<br>It’s decided. Within two sundowns, everyone’s going to be talking about my band’s ride through Fox Hollow. My lads deserve some fun – and there are plenty of men to gut and wenches to diddle there, so we’re in for quite a ball. Rumor going around claims clay pots grow from the ground in those parts. If it’s true, perhaps I’ll gather up a gaggle of those peasants, put them to work digging up that pottery and we’ll open up shop. Every organization’s got to stay nimble and agile these days. So we’ll pivot, instead of slaughtering merchants and knights – we’ll sell teapots!<br><br><br>Day 182<br>Felt like my spirit was trying to crawl out my bum, that’s how badly our kitchen crew botched our last batch of vittles. When knights errant attacked us after that, not a man among us was strong enough to hold a sword. We’ve got to get our hands on a real cook – only thing more dangerous than an imbecile with a sword is an imbecile in charge of a cooking pot. Perhaps a quick raid of the Cockatrice? Fishermen’s chowder would be a pleasant change after all this stew de dog-doo-doo!

   1205910|b438036d||Tradition is sacred in Toussaint. This fair duchy has a great many traditions, perhaps the most hallowed of which are the spectacular knightly tourneys held during nearly every important local festival. These events have earned fame and respect not only in all of Nilfgaard, but in the North as well. Thus knights journey from almost literally the entire world to enter the lists and gain glory testing their mettle against each other and the best of Toussaint chivarly.

We've cut down three of them already, but that hasn't discouraged the rest one jot. Gonna have to wipe them out or change hideouts, because frankly I didn't become a pirate to be the one getting assaulted!

   1058767|b468f2da||When a traveler from the Northern Realms first crosses the border into Toussaint, he feels at once as though he has stepped into a land ripped straight from the pages of a fantastic fairy tale. He will know no inclement weather there, for even the winters in Toussaint are mild and sunny, with only gentle, calming breezes and not a hint of gale. He will know no hunger, for the trees and bushes of that land burst with ripe and juicy fruits all the year long. He will know no loneliness, for each and every soul he encounters will treat him like a long-lost friend. He will not find a single backwater of dullness, boredom or inquietude in this overflowing stream of marvel. In Toussaint the wine rages in torrents, music plays ceaselessly and everywhere the air is filled with the sound of birdsong and the twittering of beautiful maids, who are never stingy with their ample charms when a handsome knight comes a-calling. The capital of the duchy, Beauclair, is an architectural gem, full of glorious elven monuments: delicately soaring towers, masterfully carved reliefs and atmospherically mysterious ruins. Only the rare sun in a field of black, the odd gold and dark stain on an otherwise pristine edifice, reminds one that this land, this fable incarnate, is a vassal of Nilfgaard…

   1087560|b50ecfe5||Long before men first peopled these lands, a beautiful, prospering elven city stood here, centered around the palace of King Maeglor. One day, however, the city's inhabitants began mysteriously dying off in large numbers. According to legend, King Maeglor sensed he, too, would soon perish and cast a powerful spell that caused the earth to swallow the city whole so that no outsider could ever desecrate it. Centuries later, scholars from the Oxenfurt Academy began painstaking excavations of King Maeglor's palace in a search for the causes of the catastrophe. Yet work came to a sudden halt when three subsequent expeditions ventured into the ruins' depths - and were never heard from again...

   1087429|b52c040a||The most southerly-thrusting outcrop of the Skellige Archipelago is the wild and untamed isle of Faroe. Visiting here is a must for experienced travelers undeterred by unexplored wilderness and nature at its reddest in tooth and claw. Which is not to say that Faroe is uninhabited - just that its vibrant, primeval landscapes, not its human settlements, constitute its primary attraction.<br><br>Acting as sole exception to this, and providing a wonderful treat to adventure-seeking travelers, is the port of Harviken, the home village to Clan Dimun. With a bit of luck one might find oneself there when the clan's warriors return from their overseas raids and divide their plunder. A days-long feast is thrown in the warriors' honor afterwards - providing an excellent opportunity to sample local delicacies and observe local customs. For more on this, see the "Feasts and Festivals" chapter.

They are characterized, however, by an extreme instability that, as a general rule, interferes with magic conduction and causes fluctuations in the intersection’s poles. For these reason it is ill-advised to use such intersections for any undertaking requiring a steady and stable source of energo-magic power.

   1058793|b61d0e33||What is a nonhuman? The answer is simple. As the very name suggests, it is something which resembles, and yet nevertheless is not, a human. Though it walks on two legs, speaks a tongue similar to our own and dresses in similar attire, it all the same has more in common with base beast than noble man.<br><br>Dwarves are like moles. They feel best underground and avoid direct sunlight. They like to live in filth, forever smudging themselves in mud and slime. They love everything that can be found within the earth - rocks, metal, minerals of all shape and color. It is also said that, like their kindred moles, they feed most readily on worms, roaches and other nightcrawlers.<br><br>Halflings, for their part, are more reminiscent of gophers. Fat, lazy and loud in that typical rodent way, their minds are filled only with thoughts of food and drink, which they steal from other, nobler beasts and greedily squirrel away in their hovels. They are marked by a cruel craftiness. You could be dying of hunger and they would not share a meal with you. You could be howling from poverty, and they could be swimming in gold, and yet they would still fleece you to the last crown. You could do nothing but good to them, and they would still stab a knife in your back.<br><br>Elves, in turn, seem related to the birds of prey that dwell in far-off Zerrikania. They care most for colored feathers. They would most readily spend all day staring at their reflections in the water and singing their own praises. They are so awash in self-love that they no longer feel any desire towards members of the opposite sex of their own species. Their appearance, unquestionably pleasant to the eye, is highly misleading, for they are extraordinarily cruel and any who judge them by looks alone they first dupe and then kill in cold blood. The best proof of this? The so-called Scoia'tael, bandits that claim to fight for freedom, but in truth only long to kill humans.<br><br>All these vile so-called "elder" races are, to our great fortune, slowly dying out. Joy fills the heart of every right-thinking man at the thought that his great-grandchildren will never know them, that in their day dwarves, halflings and elves will be mere fairy-tale characters used to scare young, impressionable children.

   1083692|b723c58b||When he awoke, he saw before him an endless swath of blue. On the horizon the sky merged with the glassy sea. The storm had passed. So had the longship and all its crew. He never learned how long he had lain unconscious in the lifeboat.<br><br>The sun had scorched his skin a purplish red and turned his lips to brittle parchment. He was overcome by a great thirst, but there was nothing on the boat with which to quench it. Had he been spared from so much only to die now? No... Naransen was the son of the great Gunnestad and he would never give up. He had had twenty springs under his belt when he embarked on this voyage. When was that? Long ago... very long ago. Back when his friends still lived. When he still had his left hand, not this stiff stump. When his beard was still red and not streaked with silver.<br><br>The drive for glory which had driven him from his family home had demanded a high price. Naransen had never given that a second thought, but now, alone in a lifeboat in the middle of an endless ocean, he felt tired. He wanted to once again set eyes on the farm on which he had been raised. To see the eyes of his mother, who had lulled him to sleep with tales of the deeds of the legendary heroes. Now he had become one of them. Now mothers would tell their sons about him. His greatest dream had become reality. He should have been happy, but he wasn't. Perhaps if he had known then what travails and hardship awaited him...?<br><br>Yet no man can know his future. One thing is sure, however: even if Naransen had known what horrors this life had in store for him, he never would have chosen another. He was the son of the great Gunnestad and he had walked the path of Glory, from which one can never stray. No matter the cost.

   1076174|b984873b||Saddlebags
   1023013|b986b185||Lesbeth,<br><br>I’m very flattered by your interest in my humble greenhouse and naturally will describe to you how it works. Believe me – I’ve nothing better to do here. The witchers, being witchers, are tight-lipped, and even when they do finally say something it’s rarely anything very interesting. But enough of my complaints, let’s return to the greenhouse.<br><br>“Greenhouse” is, of course, merely a term of convenience, for this construction does not require any structure that could be called a house – it consists of three monoliths made of magic-absorbent stone (basalt is best, or porphyry, but granite will do in a pinch). The monoliths must be arranged in a triangle, and then charged with energy from the elements of fire and water.<br><br>Since a triangle has three vertices, there is no way to lay out the powers symmetrically – and that is precisely the point. The unstable arrangement will strive towards equilibrium according to the principle of the conservation of magic energy. Heat is a side effect of this process – and so, as they say in Beauclair,<i>voila!</i>, within the triangle conditions become like those of a greenhouse, favorable to the cultivation of exotic plants.<br><br>Two last remarks. First, charging all three monoliths with the same element will accomplish nothing – the arrangement will be stable and there will be no flow of energy. Second, the arrangement will naturally lose its charge over time and thus must be checked up on regularly – especially bearing in mind that once equilibrium is achieved, the temperature will fall and heavy precipitation will result, following the ancient principle<i>quod magia facit, natura laxit.</i><br><br>That will have to do for now. Your Hieronymus.<br><br>PS. Perhaps by way of thanks you could come visit me? True, the witchers have made me swear on all that is holy not to reveal where Kaer Morhen lies, but you, my dear, dear Lesbeth, can be trusted.

   1224526|ba4f8e01||My Dear Friend,<br><br>If you're reading this, it means you've found the chest I mentioned in my previous letter. You'll be pleased to know its contents belong to you.<br><br>After I spoke with the emperor regarding additional resources to aid in your quest, he was willing to part with these items from his personal collection. The armor from Dol Blathanna is a rare piece that marries the strengths of Nilfgaardian and elven craftsmanship. Apparently, Francesca accepted Emhyr's offer of Nilfgaardian plate for her forces. Though, despite his attempt to significantly bolster an ally on the fringes of the Northern Realms, only a portion of his aid ever reached its destination. To no one's great surprise, the elves were unimpressed with what human steel they did receive and thus refashioned the armor to their liking. You'll finally have the opportunity to masquerade as the Queen of Dol Blathanna's personal guard. It's a dream I know you speak of often.<br><br>As for the second set of armor, the emperor proved far more cryptic. He claims they were diplomatic gifts from distant kingdoms. The tiger armor is specifically designed to suit a western ruler – obviously Emhyr in this case. It was forged in the ancient style of a blacksmith who stole the secrets of its construction from their gods... Or so the legend goes.<br><br> And finally, the swords (to my eye they resemble a Redanian saber, though I'm no expert). These blades supposedly once belonged to a hero of myth and mystery. The man forged a pact with a vixen spirit and, through her blessing, was granted the ability to slay the monsters that had long plagued his village. As you can see, he carried both a steel and silver sword – a fact I thought might pique your interest.<br><br>Unfortunately, legends are all I can offer. Emhyr was stingy with the details – even more so than usual. It's a shame because I must admit I haven't the faintest idea where they might originate. That being said, I do believe Zerrikania and Ofier can be ruled out.<br><br>Dear friend, I trust you appreciate my efforts to help. Use these gifts as you see fit. I hope they will hasten your search for that which we have lost.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer

So here's my reckoning.<br><br>First off, Your Esquire's gotta know that I can scrummage up a few hayseeds from Claywich whenever you want, but that's what I'd call second-rate goods - geezers and squirts, mainly. But if Your Excellency thinks he can find use for even dregs like that, send us a messenger and within a week's time you'll get a transport full of them, trussed up like coneys.<br><br>I've also had a word or two with some soldiers who quit the baron's service after he got soused one night and jammed a hot poker in one of them's eyes. They've pitched two camps, one right next to the castle, the other near Velen's southern border - and as I'm sure Your Wondrousness has guessed, they're looking to make some quick coin. So if Your Most Reverend Sir can send us a few crowns as a deposit, why, we'll get to work on the double-quick and send you the prettiest dames and hardiest lads in all of Velen, maybe even in all the North - a hundred, two hundred, how ever many of them The Great Sergeant wants.<br><br>Your Humble Servant,<br><br>Dalegor.

   1058755|bba47ac4||Scholars have many vices. Possibly the worst among them is a tendency to describe the simple in unnecessarily complex terms, to dress the plain in the garb of false learning.<br>“The Conjunction of the Spheres” might serve as an excellent example of this. This name, so mysterious to a commoner's ear, could be replaced with a much simpler alternative: When the Worlds Collided. The phenomenon itself can also be explained in terms simple enough for a child to understand.<br>Imagine, dear reader, that our world is a ship sailing on a great sea. From its deck we can see other, distant vessels - those are the stars. These vessels each bear their own goods and their own crews. They usually pass us at some distance, barely visible specks, even viewed through a spyglass. Once every few thousand years, however, a storm breaks above this cosmic sea, a storm so strong it tosses the ships towards one another, making them sail cheek by jowl. Part of the crew of one ship can, at such times, move to another, and some of the cargo from one ship’s hold can spill onto a neighboring vessel. When the weather calms, the ships separate once again and sail their separate, invariably different ways.<br>The so-called “post-Conjunction beings,” namely monsters such as ghouls and basilisks, are precisely such passengers from another vessel. And we humans are castaways, flung against our will from somewhere far away onto a world previously inhabited by the Elder Races. Once here, we learned the arcane mysteries of magic, unbeknownst to us before.<br>Could the worlds collide once more? Perhaps. Can this cataclysm be avoided, or the opposite - hastened? Some scholars believe there are beings who have mastered this skill, who possess rare genes allow which some to seize the helm of our vessel and steer us… to safer waters, or to our doom.

   1208569|bc91171b||Toussaint’s mighty rivers are not the only route for getting wine out of the duchy. During the spring run-off, the Sansretour becomes very dangerous to navigate and local exporters turn to transport methods less likely to result in catastrophic loss. These merchants group together into caravans, hire guards and set out with their goods overland. Their favored destination? Metinna, whose capital is likewise named Metinna, leading some Toussaintois to joke their wine is medicine for that kingdom’s fabled lack of imagination.

   1206299|bcbdd427||My Dearest Brother,<br><br>I'm so excited to hear you will be organizing a tournament where the players will be able to test the new faction. I think this is a fabulous idea. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make an appearance. My health has taken a sudden turn for the worse. The medics don't see much hope for me. Oh well... everyone shall have their turn, as our father would say. I've had a good life and do not regret anything. Well, except perhaps for a few choice cards I lost over the years, but you cannot gain without risking something.<br><br>This very well might be the last letter I write to you, so I'd like you to know I am very proud of you. A gwent tournament using the new faciton, that is the idea of a lifetime. Do not worry about those who oppose your changes - and indeed the notion of change itself. There shall always be malcontents. Those such as yourself should let intuition guide them and follow the path of progress. Where would our world be today if we allowed only the nearsighted, the unimaginative, to steer our affairs? No doubt stuck in a dark cave, with warming fires and illuminating candles beyond our reckoning. Thus I retain high hopes for your tournament and wish it all the best. I believe it shall soon be the finest, most prestigious gwent tournament in all the world. <br><br>Your brother – Igor.

   1058778|bd892204||It is commonly said that magic is neither good nor evil, that it transcends the moral criteria of men, that it depends on the mage whether it will be used for worthy goals or for shameful and immoral deeds. There is, however, one key exception to this principle - necromancy.<br><br>Proponents of this branch of magic once supposed that one can also do good by reviving corpses. Dead men can, after all, hide secrets which may save the living. It is better to send an army of reanimated corpses into battle than to squander the life of those in whose veins hot blood still flows. Moreover, a revived soldier may be reused many times, until such members are chopped off so as to make his flesh unusable.<br><br>Though it is hard to refute the logic of these arguments, the practice of necromancy is still forbidden. This is not at all based on the rabble’s superstitions about the living dead, nor the resistance of the powerful afraid those they have murdered could be forced to confess against them, nor the moral scruples of the older members of the Conclave, who were, in fact, laughed down as reactionaries when it was discussed. The fate of necromancy was sealed by the observation of Hen Gedymdeith, which was later confirmed by manifold experiences proving the revived dead are always unpredictable and reviving them always involves entirely negative side effects. In other words, no matter how noble a mage’s motives might be, necromancy will always lead to evil. It seems that in this way the gods let us know that we should not transgress the laws they have given us. And even the Conclave must respect the will of the gods.

My Seraphine brims with so much life energy, it was inevitable some would spill over into other canals. It is now up to me to cut off those spillways, vanquish my rival and hope the walls I erect will prove sufficient to satisfy her vitality and give us a life of mutual exuberance… I have already forgiven her. Now I need but meet her beau and remove him from our life. <br><br>Yesterday I followed Seraphine. They hold their trysts at the Olive Grove – how romantic. When they met... Birds flew over the grove. A whole flock… Twittering and chirping. As if celebrating the lovers’ joy… and as if mocking me cruelly…  how symbolic.<br><br>I can see this romance drain my darling wife. Since she began seeing this… her lover, she has become anemic, eternally pale. She wanders the house at night aimlessly, blindly. She used to be so lively, so radiant, yet now she is listless, apathetic, resigned. I must gather my courage and end their relationship as soon as possible.<br><br>I, Christophe Dugarry, despise violence. I shall resolve the matter of my wife’s lover pragmatically. I have prepared a full sack of Nilfgaardian florens, one so heavy I can barely lift it. I shall wait for my Seraphine to return from the grove to our residence and then I shall catch him… and make him an offer he cannot refuse. Saint Lebioda, give me strength!

   1083177|c0633e83||In a plane not unlike our own there once lived a ruler named Azgaryk. When he was an old man, he fell ill. He felt that he would soon die, so he summoned an evil spirit - Marbas - and made a deal with him. Azgaryk would live until his son came of age and ascended to the throne.<br><br>10 years passed. Azgaryk died, and next to his body Marbas appeared and turned to the heir to the throne:<br><br>"Your father promised me something. Now you must pay his debt."<br><br>"And just what did my father receive from you in return?" asked the heir. "And what do I owe?"<br><br>"Your life," said Marbas, and cut the heir's throat with his claw. The boy had not yet died when Marbas opened a gate to another plane. Out of it came a mercenary army, with the evil spirit Berith marching at its head.<br><br><br>Marbas sat on Azgaryk's throne. Ill times had come to the land. The people rebelled against the demon's rule. Marbas sent Berith and his army after them. Berith slaughtered all the rebels. His armor glistened with blood. People began to call Berith the Crimson Sovereign. Marbas' appetite was not sated, so he sent the Crimson Sovereign to conquer neighboring countries. And so it went on, for hundreds of years the Sovereign continued his march, losing soldiers as he went. But Marbas was never sated.<br><br>Finally, there came a time when the people of all the continents were united under Marbas' rule, and the Crimson Sovereign was left alone, without an army. He knelt before Marbas and said:<br><br>"You hired me and I have carried out my task. You promised me a weapon from which no shield can provide protection."<br><br>"You shall receive it," Marbas said, flashing his teeth. He reached into his garment and drew out a vial filled with plague bile.<br><br>He flung it at the Crimson Sovereign. Yet the Sovereign knew Marbas well enough to expect treachery. He opened a passage to another world and fled before the vial full of plague could hit the floor. Yet ill luck would have it that while he was fleeing, a gale came flying out of his open portal. It opened the window to Marbas' throne room and spread the plague bile out over the entire world.<br><br>Ever since Marbas has dwelled in a tower standing above a continent of dead bodies and beasts transformed by the plague. And Berith, still calling himself the Crimson Sovereign, wanders from world to world as a mercenary. Searching for vengeance.

   1083694|c162de62||One's attention immediately is drawn to the fact that their seemingly impoverished huts shine with cleanliness. The walls of their homes are usually made from pine and covered with a substance derived from sap which keeps out all manner of vermin. I believe it scares off insects as well, for I did not see a single one indoors during my entire stay in Skellige.<br><br>The interiors of their huts are quite spacious and usually divided into two rooms. The first is used by the members of the household during the day and is separated by a doorway from the second, which acts as a bedroom and contains only simple wooden beds covered with linens that resemble sacks more than Continental bedding.<br><br>In the middle of each main chamber stands a large round table around which the members of the household gather to eat only once a day. This usually happens just after dusk, the time for their main meal. This supper is a hallowed event and is carried out in a nearly ritualistic manner. At its start, before the family members have even taken their seats around the table, the eldest of the family tears off a piece of bread and places it on something of a household altar, which occupies a place of honor in each Skellige home. This serves as a symbol of respect for deceased ancestors. At the end of this ceremony for the departed, the entire family sits down to eat. The eldest woman places a steaming bowl in the middle of the table. Everyone has their own spoon, which they dip, one by one, into the basin of food. They most often eat porridge, over which they pour a gravy made from meat or fish.<br><br>Curiously, immediately upon the supper's conclusion the eldest takes the piece of bread set aside at the start of the meal and places it in a large amphora. As I later learned, when an amphora becomes full, it is filled with boiling water and a beverage is brewed which in taste somewhat resembles beer, though it is much weaker.

Only those with bowels soaked in oceans of magic arcana - and few are born with bowels so absorbent - can hope to master it.<br><br>There are exceptions, of course. Dragons, as is well known, possess such a talent innately. With no need for study they can, guided by some otherworldly intuition, change between humanoid and reptilian form. As for the other races, higher vampires (e.g.. bruxae) are known to flicker between states, yet given the understandable difficulties of conducting research in this area, we do not know if this transition constitutes an act of polymorphy.<br><br>The human race is, obviously, much more accessible to scholars of polymorphy. Their years of study have borne fruit in the form of a set of methods and guidelines for the identification, nurture and deployment of this talent. The most accomplished result of the careful application of these methods - Philippa Eilhart.

    469928|c213a67b||To follow the example of the sorcerer from the tower, we first need to classify substances, diving them into superior and inferior varieties. Only the former can be described by the theory of interdependence presented here.<br><br>Inferior substances do not produce a chain of quasi-life structures, for their nature is substandard in quality and they cannot exist independently. However, it has been proven that they are paradoxically essential for the chain to exist in spite of their inferiority. The hypothesis of interdependence assumes that the chain of quasi-life must contain one substance of each superior element. Nonetheless, the chain's structure, proposed by Raffard the White, has one too few paces for them, namely only five. If the chain were transposed and then transmuted, the problem would easily be solved. Alas, the first operation cannot be performed without damage to the chain's integrity. The only solution is to use a so-called reversed transmutation, which will eventually cause the chain to rotate. As a result of rotation all six superior substances will constantly leave and join the chain without destroying it. From the holistic point of view, there will always be six superior substances occupying five places. The ingenuity of this solution lies in the chain having all the qualities of the three inferior substances. Thus the paradox of interdependence, or as some say coexistence, is no longer a problem.<br><br>Unfortunately, since none of the modern works describe how to perform reverse transmutation, the problem of animating the inanimate remains unresolved.

Knew jumping into portal was extremely risky with only 1 crystal powering it - but still better than certain death at hands of enraged peasants. Mob broke into tower, cut off path to second crystal. Had to flee. Grabbed diagrams for Wolf School gear before going - hoping Varin would come save them, if not me. Perhaps he will come still, will jump through the portal, retrieve his diagrams, rescue me... A foolish hope. My time is very short.

Five of the last seven kidnappings ended in success. Only two of the lads had fathers too miserly to ransom their sons. Clearly was more offspring where those came from, so the calculating knaves deemed the captured snots expendable (note for the future: demand a significantly smaller ransom from clients with more than one male heir).<br><br>I sent the lads after Anastasia von Bourmann.

From what the remaining servants recount, he was killed by tree roots that suddenly thrust straight out of the ground! My men are petrified. Wolves howl day and night in the lands surrounding the estate.<br><br>Leaving the castle walls means certain death. We have barricaded ourselves inside and live as if under siege. Luckily we’ve ample supplies of food and water. Perhaps this is some kind of curse?<br><br>Franz, the servant who led the unit that kidnapped Anastasia, has hanged himself! Black magic is surely at work! I must search the castle library for some indication what this might be.

   1188299|c3f5389b||When drawn, magic, unique and witcher swords increase Sign damage dealt by $S$% of their own damage dealt.
   1188301|c3f5389c||Signs can deal critical hits. Their critical hit chance and damage increase with Sign Intensity (currently $S$% chance to deal an additional $S$% damage). Opponents killed by critical hits from Signs explode.
   1188303|c3f5389d||Each fatal blow dealt by a sword dismembers the enemy or activates a finisher. Each blow dealt by a weapon in melee combat increases Attack Power by $S$% until combat ends (to a maximum of $S$%). The bonus is lost if you take damage (not including damage from Toxicity).
   1188305|c3f5389e||Each time you are injured in melee combat, the attacking opponent receives damage in the amount of $S$% of damage dealt for every point of your Toxicity level (currently $S$%, to a maximum of $S$%).
   1188307|c3f5389f||Each Adrenaline Point decreases damage received by $S$% (to a maximum of $S$%).
   1188309|c3f538a0||When the Aard Sign is cast, it additionally has a $S$% chance of freezing enemies. This chance scales with your available Adrenaline Points. Enemies knocked down and frozen simultaneously die immediately. Enemies who are not frozen are dealt an additional $S$ damage.
   1188311|c3f538a1||At start of combat, sword Attack Power and Sign Intensity increase for $S$s by $S$% for each foe (after first). So, when fighting $S$ foes, the bonus is $S$%. Once it wears off, sword Attack Power and Sign Intensity drop by $S$% for each participating foe after first (modifier cannot exceed $S$%). Duration: $S$s.
   1188313|c3f538a2||Sword attacks deal $S$% more damage to human opponents immune to counterattacks and monsters. In all other cases, if the attacker's Vitality is less than $S$%, a counterattack immediately triggers a finisher.
   1188315|c3f538a3||Crossbow damage is now increased from $S$ to $S$ (values depend on crossbow used), and crossbow critical hit chance is increased by $S$%. Crossbow bolts pierce and knock down or stun opponents. Opponents struck when they have full Vitality lose $S$% of Vitality.

How he killed Johann for not taking off his cap quick enough. How he trampled our fields when drunk with nary a thought of repayment. How he barged in during Pieter's wedding and demanded his right of the first night. Now we've finally got what we begged Melitele for in our prayers for so long - the judge recognized our grievances and waived all our bonds and duties to the lord.

Volker fumed our home with hazel wood smoke to drive out evil, buried a marten under the gate, to make sure no thieves cross our threshold. And then he gave me a bracelet - loveliest I've ever seen. Mother said it's foolish to spend so much on a bauble when we haven't ploughs nor hoes and that we ought return it to the merchant. Over my dead body! I'll never take it off. It'll always be there to remind me of Volker - of how happy we were that day.<br><br>23 IV 1250<br><br>They say the lord is coming to see us.

Making a mold of the key with a lump of clay - damned clever, can't believe I didn't think of it meself! I strolled right into the armory after dark, Kuliu was lying there right where you said, in a case, wrapped in oilcloth. What a blade! Fits your hand like a toothsome lass's tit, point's sharp as a needle, hilt's set with gems… Stared so hard I didn't hear that fool Olaf coming. He would've caught me had he not tripped and smacked his gob into the ground. Seems the gods are lookin' after us!<br><br>So now we've got to sell the blade - and that won't be easy. Not many got that kind of coin, and them who do don't want to cross Crach. Luckily, my brother Yrjan knows a merchant, fellow named Gimre, who always finds willing buyers for "second hand" goods. They're going to meet in the old fortress near Fyresdal. Maybe they'll make a deal with Lugos? He's got heaps of gold - and not a drop of fear for an Craite.<br><br>Cheers to you, old goat!<br>Sveinar<br>

This is an event renowned the world over and the lack of a representative of our order is a glaring omission and casts a dark shadow on the reputation of our Order.<br><br>Sadly, ever since the death of Brother Roderick de Wett, we have no worthy champion, and our most skilled brother, Patrick of Weyze, has contracted scrofula so fierce he cannot mount a horse even for a minute.<br><br>We thus trust the choice of you, brother, which is natural in this situation, will prove wise and you shall not betray the hope we have placed in you.<br><br>Immediately upon receipt of this letter go to the nearest branch of the Vivaldi Bank, where you will accept a transfer of coin in the amount of 784 crowns. These are your delegation funds, which you are obliged to return in full plus a 50% penalty if you do not take a place on the podium. Brother Adalbert, who – as you know – has taken on the role of specialist in the matters of the Order’s view in the public eye, has calculated that a loss on the part of our representative will cause more damage than not taking part in the tourney at all. So you understand our position.<br>May the Eternally Flaming Rose lie your path in this endeavor!<br><br>Brother Evariste of Metinna, First Secretary of the Order

Maybe it wasn't the herbs that have lead to this, but a curse placed upon me by an old beggar whom I had to chase off one time. I have to find out. I want to hire someone who can find the herbalist. <br><br>I cannot think and it is getting hard to write. <br><br>Loneliness. No family… <br><br>Eat. I want to eat. Not a good spoon.

   1113901|c799bcb6||Brethren!<br><br>I write you now in my own blood, so you may now what fate befell me.<br><br>Following M’s orders, I traveled to Novigrad to resupply and sell our latest batch of fisstech. I left the men in my command on our boat along with the goods and the coin while I went to the hut on the beach to await WJ’s men. When they arrived, it was well after dark, and one of them bore a linen sack on his back. This sack did not contain the promised Novigrad crowns – instead, it held the heads of my men. The scoundrels demanded to know where the fisstech was, but I only told them about the case on the ship, which they will never open without the key. My choice to slip this into my arse shortly before they caught me proved wise, for they searched everywhere else. Though they interrogated me harshly, I withheld the truth. Instead I insisted one of the men they murdered on the ship was carrying the key, and my role was merely to negotiate. They wanted to kill me at once, but their captain had another idea at the last minute. They locked me in this becursed cage, to wither and die slowly from hunger and thirst.<br><br>The second day of my captivity I heard the screams of my captors. I know not whether I saw true or visions, but it seemed drowners had emerged from the water and were devouring the whoresons alive. Yet the problem remains that they (the whoresons, not the drowners) have so securely locked me in I see no means of escape…<br><br>I have sat here six days now. I stopped feeling hunger after the third, my guts having turned in on themselves. Now I dream only of drink. I’d give all the gold in the world for a sip of water. It could be rank and full of larvae, and still I would guzzle it greedily… I drank my own urine for the first few days, but I no longer produce any.<br><br>I have nothing left. Not even hope. The last thing keeping me sane is the task of writing this letter to you. Farewell.<br>Anselm

    458855|c807167f||Sveinar - I got good news and bad. I'll start with the bad… Me and Gimre went to Lugos. Gave us the welcome custom demands, mead and meat aplenty. But as soon as we unwrapped Kuliu from its leather and asked how much he'd give us for it, he ripped the blade from our hands and knocked us both on our arses, calling us thieves. He then sent us running from his house, hounds at our heels. Gimre runs slow, so they got him. That's fine - only means a bigger cut for us.<br><br>Now here's the good news - we still got the sword, and now I know how to get rid of it. I talked to Steinfinn, me brother in law, and he'll sell Kuliu in Novigrad and split the coin with us after. I know, I know, but I swear, you can trust him. I'll give him the sword on the beach by the whale cemetery on Ard Skellig. I'll go alone, so as not to attract attention.<br><br>Watch out, Lugos might have sent a messenger to Kaer Trolde to inform them of the theft. Just in case, hole up somewhere - maybe with Aunt Hilde?

   1058770|cb9d6409||One can hear Ithlinne's Prophecy whispered at every market, garbled and reused by every village witch, delved into in any treatise touching on sooths and diviners and in general saturating our common culture. We all know that "the time of the Wolf's Blizzard approaches, the Time of the White Frost" and that "the world will perish amidst ice." But few truly understand the meaning of these words.<br><br>The self-proclaimed prophets who shout out Ithlinne's words mistake stars reflected in a still pond for the sky. For the White Frost is no legend or mythical apocalypse. It is a natural phenomenon that can be described in the dry yet precise language of scholarship.<br><br>The renowned scholar of Thorn's studies have clearly shown that our world is not the center of the universe, but one of a thousand such globes spinning in the endless darkness of space. This space is usually described as a vacuum - yet to do so is grossly misleading, for through this "vacuum" swims, invisible to the naked eye, the White Frost.<br><br>We do not know exactly what the White Frost is - perhaps a microscopic dust that blocks the incoming light of the sun? Perhaps infinitesimal particles of the sort postulated by Democritus of Ban Ard, with the unusual property of sucking up warmth as a sponge does water?<br><br>We know for a certainty however, that, thanks to the telescopic observations of elven astronomers, the White Frost, whatever it is, has already destroyed a great many worlds. The star systems in which it appears perish into lifeless hunks of ice over the course of a few decades. Furthermore, each scholar is agreed that the White Frost will one day come to our world. Ithlinne's Prophecy, though based on magic intuition and not scientific observation, thus appears to foretell the truth.<br><br>Many mages are skeptical about the theses presented here. I recommend they carry out the same experiment I have conducted in my own laboratory. Using the spell<i>Portus Asterum</i>, open a microscopic portal for three and a half seconds to the coordinates 03 31 48 90, 89 27 09 34. Yet before you do, dress in your warmest furs and ready an axe for breaking through thick ice.

Clarissa has asked for a half-day off, and I’ll sneak away from the chancellery. That old fogey of a supervisor will never notice I’m missing. And even if he did, so what! I’m young, I’ll find other work.<br>Although… if Clarissa found out I’d lost my job, she might not agree… I’d have proposed to her ages ago, were I not aware how much she fears a life of poverty. She’s never said as much, but I can see it worries her.<br>But what are we waiting for? Together we shall live more economically than apart, and finally we shall not have constantly to scheme up ways to meet here!<br>I wanted to invite her to dine at the best eatery in all of Beauclair… So many times I have imagined what it would be like. Waiters decked out in golden livery would bring us foie gras and sorbets. Clarissa would sit on a satin cushion, a raven-black crown of hair on her head and looking beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all the room.  Then, I would pull out a diamond ring.<br>But the truth is I shall never be able to afford all that, not even if Clarissa were to insist a ring of simple silver would be enough for her and we’d be better of spending that coin to buy a house in Hauteville, where we could open up a shop and she could sell hats.<br>Thus I shall propose to her tomorrow, in the abandoned wine cave which serves as our meeting place, our cozy sanctuary where we have spent so many pleasant hours together. She never complained that our only romantic moments have been spent surrounded by cobwebs and old barrels of wine. But tomorrow marks the end of all that! Once we are wed, I will carry her across my threshold. It will be tight quarters, but there will be room enough for a bed. And there will be no cobwebs.<br>I’ve only a simple copper ring for her, with a red glass jewel of the cheapest sort. But I promise in a year’s time I will exchange it for a silver one, with an amethyst, or maybe even a ruby!<br>O, Clarissa! Tomorrow cannot come soon enough!<br>I think I shall not be able to fall asleep tonight.

Believing in coincidences is a privilege the officer commanding the Imperial Embassy’s defense brigade cannot afford.<br><br>The caravan transporting wine purchased for the imperial court was attacked and robbed within the borders of the duchy. The barrels of wine themselves are extremely valuable, yet traveling with the caravan was the undersecretary responsible for returning the embassy’s unused operation wherewithal. In other words, florens allotted to spread goodwill will not return to the empire’s coffers – for they are now in the hands of bandits.

At least mumsy supports me and lent me her mirror… along with the two others I bought with my savings, I will be able to test whether the device I have invented will indeed work!<br><br>But first I shall sum up the beginning of my tale, for the benefit of any who happen upon it  only at this moment. My dearest love, Alige Elise, dwells with her family at an estate snuggled in a valley so deep that, between September and March, the sun is continually hidden behind the abutting slopes. All the residents of this settlement must live in constant twilight and darkness for these long months. Yet soon, this perennial torture will be but a dark memory! My invention is brilliant in its simplicity. Atop one of the nearby mountains, I shall install a system of mirrors to reflect the rays of the sun towards her manor! That’s it! Haha! It was worth it, all those long nights spent at the Imperial Academy Library during my studies, perfecting my skills in arithmetic and alchemy!<br><br>I would like to test my discovery today, but father keeps shouting that my “contraption” will only attract a few feeble-minded magpies to doodoo all over our abode, or, even worse, bring in a flock of harpies – but he’s always got a problem with everything! I’ll wait until he leaves for town, then set up my mirrors in a flash!

   1206938|cd7ddd87||I’d always enjoyed practicing my craft. Killing came as naturally to me as blowing my nose. They raised me to be a knight, and being a brigand’s not much different. First, blood and swords, then wine and harlots to wash the worries away. But ever since that horrid night… everything has changed. My dreams are filled with nightmares in which I relive those events, step by step…<br><br>We took the estate by storm and pulled Maximus Macrinus out of his bedding, still in his nighties. Yet we had to put off dealing with him and first see to his family. Those were our orders, like it or not, but… it’s one thing to impale some corpulent cow-diddler with a wine-stained mustache and quite another to string up a snot-nosed runt. He squealed like a little girl when the lads threw the noose around his neck. Macrinus tried to buy us off – even showed me the candlestick lever that opens the hidden vault where he hides his family treasures, but Filibert’s orders were clear.<br><br>Next up was Maximus’ wife… the lads spent a long time having their way with her and making Maximus watch. Too long. I didn’t know the harlotsbrood and haven’t a clue what he did to Filibert to make him wish such a fate on him and his family, but… That was too much for me. Only once his whole clan was swinging did we turn our attention to Macrinus. We stuck him with hot pokers, cut off his ears, then slit his gut… and he… throughout all this horror he didn’t scream once. Only groaned under his breath. When it came time for him to die, in a puddle of his own excrement, under the tree where we’d hanged his wife and son… he looked me in the eyes and whispered, “Vengeance will be mine! In this life, or the next!” Those were his last words. Dark clouds filled the sky in that instant, and a harsh gale sprung up… Then I gave the order to move out.<br><br>I remember perfectly how, when I reported this back to Filibert, he was all smiles. Happy as a clam. Didn’t even harangue me for not looting the manor. It was clear he cared about one thing, and one thing only: Macrinus’ death.<br><br>Yet news of the treasure we left at Casteldaccia quickly spread around Mont Crane and a few lads from our hanse are fixing to head over there to see what they can find. I’ll join them. I’ll bury the remains still lying there, in the yard – maybe then their spirits will know peace. Maybe I’ll wipe away at least some of my sins. Maybe at last I’ll be able to sleep soundly.

   1205969|ce293f09||One of the most extraordinary individuals I have encountered during my numerous adventures at Geralt’s side was the vampire known as Regis. To be precise, he was known as Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. By his own reckoning, he was 428 years old and was the descendant of unfortunate beings trapped in our world during the Conjunction of Spheres.<br>You are surely thinking, Dear Reader, about katakans alps and other such monsters and are pondering how it was that the witcher – who, it must be admitted, is a slayer of monsters – came to keep such company. I must here explain that Regis was a higher vampire, a creature which physically does not differ all that much from a man. Higher vampires are also much more powerful than their wild confreres, and their regenerative abilities significantly outpace those of anything else you have encountered or can even imagine.<br><br>But it is not because of his outer appearances or inner strengths that Regis became our dear companion. True, he could be pretentious and rather pompous in his frequent length perorations, but one would be hard-pressed to find in him the haughtiness usually present in higher beings.<br><br>Regis valued human life dearly and refused to kill unless forced to do so. As he once confessed, higher vampires do not in fact need to drink blood at all in order to survive. They treat it somewhat as we treat alcohol. A rough grasp of this dynamic might be given to you by the fact that, when we met him, Regis had been abstinent for years.<br><br>He never revealed to us why he decided to join our search for Ciri. He had never met her before. Nor did he live to see her. He died at Stygg Castle, during the battle against the mad mage Vilgefortz, who was responsible for the whole affair. He died for a cause which he surely did not fully understand, but he did it to defend those he held dear and simply because it was the right thing to do.<br><br>I shall always remember him as an rural surgeon reeking of herbs – that is how he came to us during our first encounter at the Fen Carn necropolis, when he treated me and my companions to a fantastic brew he made from mandrake root. Wherever you are, my friend, bottoms up!

And lo and behold, what did the Most Holy Flames illuminate for me there? A hive of hardened heathens, too lost in sin to lift a cursed finger to care for the hearth of the Eternal Fire! Filled with divine wrath, I ask them, "Why's your chapel in such a sorry state?! Why's your cemetery all covered in weeds?!" Their response? "Ghosts! Curses fallen upon hallowed ground." They blame it on the ealdorman's wife, say she went mad from riches and… [illegible fragment] ... and ever since that tragedy, chapel's lain in ruins, with no one daring to go near. So the task falls on me to guide these foolish lost sheep back on the righteous path and away from the rubbish they believe. I intend to enter the chapel alone, armed only with the torch of the Eternal Fire to light my path, and see just what lurks within...

   1209260|cfc3ae0a||Some monsters are born out of necessity – not because they are cruel, but because they have to defend themselves. For them, it is hunt or be hunted. Others are simply a mistake of nature, beasts brought to life by an evolutionary hiccup, so to speak. Both these sorts of monsters we are able to fight.<br><br>But there are also monsters born of sin. Wherever there is cruelty and envy, wherever earth has been drenched in blood and rocks soaked in suffering, there the hellhounds have their home. And as cruelty spreads, so, too, shall these monsters. They are the reflection of us and to defeat them would mean to defeat ourselves. All that is left is to wait until we are torn to shreds by hordes of these demonic dogs.

   1061797|d055438d||The Empire and the North crossed swords again in 1267 to 1268. Following an eruption of mage treachery on Thanedd Island, Nilfgaard could not sit idly by while the North let magic sow destruction freely. The Imperial Army took Lyria at lightning speed, meeting with little resistance. After short sieges, our forces marched into Rivia and Vengerberg, greeted each time by jubilant crowds thirsty for peace and civilization. We then moved against Aedirn.<br><br>(…) King Demavend’s attempt to stop the Golden Sun’s triumphant march failed, and his forces were pushed back to the Pontar Valley and Dol Blathanna.<br><br>(…) Queen Meve began to format guerilla bands made up of bandits and outlaws, of which the North has never been short.<br><br>(…) In a display of typical Nordling treachery, King Henselt signed a truce with the Empire behind his allies’ backs, resulting in Aedirn being promptly partitioned.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty, in an act of supreme benevolence, created an elven state in Dol Blathanna, thus forging a bulwark of tolerance against the abhorrent racist laws of the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) King Foltest of Temeria signed a truce with the Empire. Yet this Nordling’s word proved to have as much value as the snow melting in the fields that spring. The truce held a mere sixteen days before it was violated. Foltest’s stupidity led to the Slaughter of Brugge, and then to a number of bloody battles in the Yaruga Valley. Faced with senseless and uncontrolled violence, the Imperial Army's leadership took it upon itself to tamp the bloodshed and ordered a retreat to Sodden.<br><br>Sadly, Foltest’s greed meant that hostilities resumed with the coming of spring. They culminated with the Battle of Brenna, where our heroic regiments faced a combined Temerian-Redanian force. To this day the North considers said battle a turning point in the war. There is no point debating this conviction. Far more important is the fact that this battle saw two strategies confronted: an honorable one, presented by the Imperial Army’s leadership, and one of trickery and subterfuge, conducted by the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty realized the direction the conflict had taken. The Northern armies employed scorched-earth tactics, caring not at all for the pain they inflicted on civilian populations. Disgusted and unwilling to take part in this type of war, Nilfgaard withdrew its armies south. The Nordlings mistakenly saw this as an admission of defeat.<br><br>(…) Through the Emperor’s mediation, an armistice was drawn up and eventually signed in Cintra, putting an end to the Second Northern War.

   1080842|d2836488||Yestereve Nordrada popped her clogs. For long years she'd played on our pity, begging for alms and her due as a lone widow without kin. Yet 'twas all lies. We went to ready her body for burial, and lo and behold, behind her stove sat a sack bursting with grain, beans and peas, and next to it a satchel of dried apples and mushrooms.<br><br>We summoned the ealdorman at once and decided as follows: the food we'll parcel out to everyone in the village, and Nordrada we'll deny a proper burial, tossing her into the swamp with a stone tied to her legs instead, so that she may never know peace after death. Let this be a sign to all who steal for themselves at the cost of others and hide food from the rest of the village while covering it up with lies. Such shall be cursed by gods and man.
   1209945|d2840d6d||Noblemen!<br><br>Presented below is a set of rules for dueling which every self-respecting gentleman should follow. Although their nature is that of an honorable agreement, failure to respect them shall bring infamy and shame to the name of the dueler and exclude him from all respectable social circles. This code applies throughout the whole of the duchy of Toussaint. <br><br>Course of the duel:<br>1. The Parties present their Seconds. Each of the Parties is entitled to one Second.<br>2. The Parties decide whether the duel ends when first blood has been drawn or when one of the Parties surrenders<br>(let it be remembered that in Toussaint, by order of Her Enlightened Highness, duels fought till last blood are punished by immediate imprisonment).<br>3. The Challenged Party selects the weapons for the duel. The Challenger is obliged to accept the choice of the Challenged Party.<br>4. The Parties duel according to the rules agreed upon. The Seconds ensure proper course of the duel.<br>5. When the duel is over, the Seconds announce the winner and the loser.<br><br>NOTE: It is strictly forbidden to put forth any claims (blood revenge included) based upon defeat in the duel. The duel is commonly regarded as an instance putting a definite end to the dispute.

   1205713|d29f061f||I, Aweagnial, write this missive to you, elven brother from another time, to ensure memory of our sad fate never perishes.<br><br>After many failed attempts, the treacherous Dh’oine finally managed to reach King Divethaf and stick his flesh with steel. The court medics’ healing brews provided no succor and King Divethaf did not last the night. At that moment our morale, which had already suffered a great trial during the weeks-long siege, reached rock-bottom. But were we to allow the body of our leader to fall into the hands of the Dh’oine? Let them put his head on a pike?<br><br>The mage Barrfhionn did not have to ponder long. The king’s place is in his family crypt, in Cyttorhak. I was one of the volunteers who carried the body from the palace through underground tunnels.<br><br>Yet somehow the Dh’oine picked up our trail and attacked us in the temple. After a short battle, we made a unanimous decision. Barrfhionn shall leave and close the entrance to the crypts behind him. We shall stay behind and place the king in his grave. The mage hesitated a short while, yet knew the palace would fall without his support. He left, swearing he would soon return, once our troops have fought off the Dh’oine with the help of General Saempolinh, whose army should reach us any day now. [rest of letter illegible]

   1059396|d2fb0dc8||What exactly is the Elder Blood?<br>According to some, it is a powerful elven curse passed from generation to generation. Those in whose veins the infamous <i>Hen Ichaer</i> flows are said to carry death and destruction within them, to sow hatred and disdain in the hearts of men. It was from this contaminated blood that Ithlinne prophesied an avenger would be born, a destroyer of nations and worlds.<br>Others claim the Elder Blood is an extremely rare inherited talent, granting control over time and space to a degree unattainable even to elven Sages. Sadly, few bearers of this gift have been able to control it in full. This merely partial mastery inevitably leads to sudden outbursts of the Power that take the form of unpredictable, uncontrollable and thus extremely dangerous explosions. Behind the dark legends about the Curse of the Elder Blood lies the truth of these tragic cases.<br>For obvious reason the bearers of the Elder Blood were always subjects of great interest to the world's mighty and to mages alike. The former counted on the truth of Ithlinne’s prophecy, on an avenger being born who could destroy worlds, and who they could thus use for their purposes. As for the latter, they hoped to harness the magic of <i>Hen Ichaer</i> to broaden their own knowledge and powers.<br>Ultimately, however, all these plans were for naught - the Elder Blood line broke off with the disappearance of the heiress to the Nilfgaardian crown, Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon…
   1207251|d2fe1dc6||21st Day of Service<br>So diddling bored. There’s really sod all to do here. A quick morning round’s enough to water all the plants. Flower bed in front of the embassy doesn’t demand much care, either. And so it goes, day after day. Maybe tonight I’ll take a jaunt to San Sebastian. Play a hand of gwent.<br><br>22nd Day of Service<br>Bloede gwent. Lost a whole month’s wages. Next month’s, too. Racked up debts with that Graybill Pellegrin. Heard he doesn’t let such things slide. Got to scrounge up a few florens somehow, or this might end badly for me.<br><br>24th Day of Service<br>Overheard the ambassador give instructions to his secretary. In the coming days, they’ll send a transport carrying wine bought for the imperial court, along with some “unused operational wherewithal.” My guess – they mean a sack stuffed with florens! Information like that could be worth a fortune to a lad from the right part of town…<br><br>27th Day of Service<br>Graybill Pellegrin slaughtered the caravan’s guards, snatched all its cargo. Had the gall to deliver a pouch of coin to me at the embassy. Said it was my share. I spit on his coin, but I’m afraid I’ll need it, soon enough… I hid what he gave me in a safe place. Ever since Old Ralph died, no one buys wooden planters anymore, so his workshop’s the perfect hiding spot.<br><br>29th Day of Service<br>Graybill told me to keep my ears open at the embassy, find out when they’ll have another caravan to grab. As if as an afterthought, he added the guard commander would be quite shocked to learn about my role in the previous hijacking… I stole the next convoy’s route from the secretary’s office. It’s the price I must pay for my idiot idea of going in cahoots with Graybill Pellegrin.<br><br>31st Day of Service<br>The transport’s set off. This time it’s escorted by Arnold aep Bluhm – commander of the embassy guard. Graybill’s men don’t know they’re in for - a fight against elite soldiers. When he finds out… Then it’s time to get out of here. Coin I set aside should be enough to start afresh, somewhere far, far away. Maecht seems like a good direction.

I don't understand. <br>H.B. - You don't know what fear is, sir? <br>E.H. - No. I have mastered your language, yet some concepts are beyond me. What is fear? <br>H.B. - It's a feeling that destroys every other feeling. It controls your head and your heart. <br>E.H. - What do you mean? I thought it was a kind of pain. I have carried out tests in my laboratory on people and I discovered that a mother subject to appropriate stimuli is able to forget about her child and think only about how to avoid pain. So fear would be similar to pain? <br>H.B. - No. Pain rules the body, but fear is born in the heart. <br>E.H. - Oooh yes… What you say is very interesting… I think I will have to examine your heart in the laboratory. <br>H.B. - What do you mean… examine? <br>E.H. - I mean examine. Take it out and subject it to a proper examination. <br> H.B. - But, sir, that would… kill me! <br>E.H. - Yes, your mortality is a great inconvenience, but was not me who created your species and I am not responsible for its excessive frailty. <br><br>The conversation was carried out in human language in such it was written down. The transcription does not need translating.

   1194261|d43ef608||This hanse’s mighty odd. All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…

I could have hired men to dig a cellar, but I’d hate to slow work on barreling the grapes, and at any rate, no dug out cellar can match a limestone cavern.<br><br>The one I found is perfect – spacious and not at all overly damp. And I came across it thoroughly by accident, while strolling among the rocks. My foot slipped into a crevasse, and when I tugged it free a few stones fell down into it. I listened for a long while before I heard them hit the bottom. I then walked around the entire slope until I finally found an entrance!<Br><br>Tomorrow we will begin turning it into a storehouse and transferring the barrels.<br><br>[Later entry, consisting of hurriedly scrawled entries] Monsters in cave. Huge centipedes. Men barely escaped. We’ll try to go again, recover what we can. Must block off all entrances. Hope no one else ever stumbles into that accursed cave…

   1186969|d6cbc452||Brother,<br><br>Enough of this hesitation, this fretting, these feelings of guilt! Liam Coronata pays you practically nothing, and you’ve got a family to feed! So do as I say. Load up a cart with barrels of that new spiced wine and in the night, quiet as a mouse, haul it away from the estate. Head northwest, and when you cross the stream, you’ll find men waiting for you. Give them the barrels. They must be desperate to get this wine, because merely as down payment they’ve handed me a pleasantly heavy pouch… Just be careful, because a pair of those vile rock trolls hunt in the Blessure Valley. How’d trolls end up there, you ask? They were imported! For the tourney, for knights to battle for the crowd’s amusement. Thing is, they fled the transport and began slaughtering their way across the land.<br><br>P.S. Hide the share of the down payment I’ve sent, because if someone finds you with that kind of coin, they’ll start asking questions and our business will end quicker than it began.<br><br>P.P.S.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Fox Hollow – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the caves known as Tulasens. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Loth Halfbreed, wanted by writ of law in Angren and Toussaint, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 18% to take into account water use fees and immediate payment in species.

Daddy gets cross when I ask him when he will earn some and once he nearly hit me. My friends have beautiful toys. Laura has a teddy bear, and Michelle has a doll with golden hair that you can brush with a real comb.<br><br>I worry that I will never have a toy, which is why I am writing to you, Master Shopkeeper. I wanted to write this letter to you a long time ago, but I didn't know how to write then. Now I know. If you have a pretty toy that other children don't want, I will look after it. It will be happy with me. Please don't laugh at me. I know I am little, but I also know that toys are not really alive. They only live in our imagination. But so what? I would love it very much. <br><br>Iza.

   1021668|d9164441||Tristianna did not care a whit for her stepmother’s admonitions. She would toss off her ragged foot wrappings and walk barefoot instead. She would wear Koviri lace and batik knickers under her rough hairshirt. And when dusk fell and the other novices dutifully went to offer their evening prayers, she would slip off quietly and run down to the bay, where Isador awaited her. This merry devil was thick as a barn and had hooves instead of feet – but Tristianna like him all the same, more than anyone else in the world. For him, she broke off her betrothal and defied her family’s will. She knew that if their bond was ever discovered both she and Isador would be burned at the stake, and so in the dark hours of night she planned their escape.

   1207797|d973e108||The year 781 marked the final end of elven rule in Toussaint – the closing of an era that had lasted over one and a half thousand years.<br><br>The elves abandoned their ivory cities and left for the mountains, taking with them all that they could and destroying everything else. Whatever they could not take and did not manage to demolish or burn, they cursed.<br><br>The last elven sovereign, Divethaf, hundreds of years old yet fair as a youth, was defeated. Weeping over the slain army of his forever-young brothers and sisters, he agreed to pay homage to Ludovic, the first human king of Toussaint (who, though young, was as shrunken and ugly as the night after Saovine).<br><br>Putting on no end of airs and graces, Ludovic boasted, “Look – the proud elf shall bow down before me and kiss my royal feet with humility!” To degrade Divethaf even further, Ludovic decided the homage should take place in the elf king’s barely-abandoned palace. The throne on which Ludovic now boldly lounged bore still-smoldering marks from the fire set by the elves, who had sought to burn the whole palace down as they left.<br><br>So the proud elven king bowed down before the human king and offered him a sacrifice of bread and wine, as well as his sword and shield.<br><br>Spewing out merciless mockery all the while, Ludovic received this homage, then immediately ordered his guards drag Divethaf beyond the palace gates and throw him down the stairs as if he were a beggar.<br><br>Witnesses claimed the proud elf remained calm throughout the whole event, but when left alone, Divethaf wiped the blood off his face and vowed cruel revenge on the king – revenge that would come from stone as cold as the king’s heart.<br><br>Yet these ominous words bore no fruit, for in the year 782, before the homage was renewed, Divethaf drew his last breath alongside his remaining soldiers when the Toussaintois decided to celebrate the anniversary of the surrender of the elven sovereign with a pogrom of non-humans on the slopes of Mount Gorgon. Few survived.

   1021730|dacb1ce0||And should we thus submit our life to religion, or should we interpret religion so that it serves our lives instead? There are as many schools as there are philosophers, as many stories as there are human beings (and let us not forget elven beings, nor dwarven, halfling, gnomish ones, nor any other such sapient creature familiar with the quandaries of the soul). I, for my part, having survived now more than one hundred and twenty years (vodka and radishes work wonders, lend no creedence to anyone who claims differently), can swear with all certainty that there is no way to reconcile everyone at once, and what pleases one will provoke whingeing and sulking in another, and will undoubtedly cause a third to reach for his knife if it dares depart from his known, narrow world by so much as a hair. What then are we to do? How should we live? Why, as we like, as our soul urges, disregarding all the brayings of philosophers and ethicists, those contained in this tome included - disregard them as we would fairy tales or old wives’ legends.

You'll be happy to know… you were. I'll only acknowledge it this once, so go on - savor the moment. But I digress - although the contract seemed easy enough, I should've waited for your arrival. How many times now have we made that mistake, hm?<br><br>I think I've contracted something, fallen ill somehow. And yes, I know that's impossible. But I have no other way to explain my fever and lapses in memory. Here's hoping I have a uniquely weak constitution for a witcher, because if not, I find the alternative explanation far more concerning. But if somehow the worst were to happen, I've prepared some notes for you. I marked each location with our insignia - you can't miss them.<br><br>For now, I'll experiment with a potion similar to Petri's Philter, though I lack celandine. With any luck I'll find some in the grasses surrounding Devil's Pit - that, or I'll have to substitute sewant mushrooms. If all goes well, you won't even read this. If all goes poorly – but it won't! – I'll store the recipe and ingredients for you. Again, just in case, because you'll never need to read this.<br><br>Reinald

By the power of said decree, each knight thus rendering aid will be rewarded according as per the following: a remuneration of the “Heron” type (in the case of aid in a battle against one human opponent) or of the “Crane” type (in the case of aid in a battle against more than one human opponent or a nonhuman opponent), to be paid from the funds of the knight receiving aid within one fiscal month.<br>Above-mentioned “Crane”-type remuneration has been awarded to the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who lent assistance to Sir Michel Zevaco. Sir Zevaco was traversing the area near Fox Hollow in relation to a vow which he had sworn and which required him to rid said village of a pestilence of the vandaguilder sort related to the criminal organization of one Loth Halfbreed. While providing assistance, Sir Zevaco and the witcher eradicated several of Loth Halfbreed’s henchmen, pursuant to Her Illustrious Grace’s Order of March 24th, 1264, on the Protection of the Borderlands.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 2.5% to take into account the tax on the use of foul words and immediate payment in species.

    477514|dc7ed317||(…) The island folk of Skellige, like many nations of the North, hold a series of beliefs about the Wild Hunt as recorded in legends, myths and fables. This horrifying phenomenon is said to herald the coming of war and misfortune. Characteristic of their tales, and distinguishing them from their continental versions, is that the islanders imagine the Wild Hunt not as a cavalcade of wraiths galloping across the night sky, but as a ghostly longship. The vessel, called the Naglfar, is said to be built of "the claws of dead men." For this very reason, superstitious Skelligers remove the nails of their dead, expressly to prevent them from being used to fortify this ghastly ship. In many legends the Naglfar sails out of Morhogg - the land of chaos (…)

Poor Gaspard had to listen to the constant complaints of customers who would charge into his office in a huff about Vegga’s behavior. Yet the girl clung firm to her principles and her ironclad drive to see them through. She would never perform with any lights lit and would avert her gaze with a powerful blush upon catching sight of the male member. Gaspard’s greatest headache, however, was the fact that virtuous Vegga never, ever accepted any payment for her services (…)

   1147939|dc9f56a1||Wisdom is a virtue which one should strive to cultivate throughout one's life, for it is impossible to be so wise one cannot become even wiser. The wise know this… As we journey through life, we should seek to make wise choices. Remember, wise choices are not those which make our lives easier or simpler. Often, they make them more complicated. But always they make us better.
    462202|dca0f6ae||No one is born a mage. We still know too little about genetics and the mechanisms of heredity. We devote too little time and resources to this research. Sadly, we still conduct trials in the inheritance of magic ability using, let us say, natural methods. The results of these pseudo-experiments far too often can be seen in the gutters of our cities and begging outside our temple walls. Far too often we see and encounter brain-dead and moronic women, women covered in their own spittle and passing themselves as prophetesses, seers, village diviners and miracle workers – cretins with brains degenerated by the uncontrolled Power they inherited.<br><br>These simpletons and fools can themselves breed, can pass on their “abilities” and continue the degeneration. Is anyone capable of foreseeing or defining what the last link in such a chain will look like?<br><br>Most of us mages lose the ability to procreate as a result of changes and disruptions to the functioning of our pituitary glands. Others – sorceresses, most often – mature into their magic powers with gonads intact. They can conceive and give birth – and have the audacity to consider that good fortune, a blessing. Yet I repeat: no one is born a mage. And no one should be! Aware of the gravity of what I write, I provide an answer to the question posed at the Summit in Cidaris. I answer with every certitude: each of us must decide what she wants to be – a sorceress or a mother.

   1190172|dd042e8f||To Edgar Ciseaudoigts:<br><br>I’m sending you one of those miscreant knights. This particular bloede skrekk attacked our lads near Fox Hollow, sent six of them – and one dog -- off to push daisies. I was about to hack him apart on the spot, then I thought: this harlotsbrood deserves a more thorough hacking than I can give! So use those famous scissors of yours and trim him of all protuberances and danglies, then cut out his innards and make origami. Just be sure to tie him up good before you get to work. Even with his hands tied, that maggoty mutt swung so hard, teeth came pouring out of Beulaf’s jaw like crowns spilling from a full pouch.<br>Loth

   1077534|dd27da3f||A long, long time ago, in a place far, far away there lived an old bear. One day the bear went into the woods to look for honey. He found an old birch with a hole in it, and peered inside. Wild bees had made a hive there, but they were gone, and there wasn't any honey, either. The bear scratched his fuzzy head, paced around a few times, then set off to a nearby village.<br><br>The sun stood high in the sky and most of the villagers were out working in the fields, harvesting their crops. When the bear entered the village, a group of children playing hopscotch ran away in fear. The old bear shambled over to the larder. With one swipe of his heavy paw he knocked off the latch and walked inside, scaring off a fat ginger cat whose whiskers were covered in cream.<br><br>When they heard the noises coming from the larder, the children crept out of their hiding places and peeked inside. Soon enough, out came the bear. And what a sight that was! The bear walked on his two hind legs and had a great sack slung over his back as he strolled towards the freshly-harvested fields. Soon all the village was staring as the furry creature walked the furrows, sowing seeds from his sack. When the bear finished, he tossed the sack on the ground and returned to his cave.<br><br>Weeks passed. Fall came, and then the frosts of winter, until finally spring melted the snows. The seeds the bear had planted sprouted and covered all the fields with golden flowers. Soon bees were hovering above the flowers, gathering nectar in the hot sun.<br><br>There was honey enough for the both the bees and the villages, with plenty left over afterwards for the very happy old bear.

   1061871|dd61ca57||Redania is a kingdom belonging to the so-called League of Northern States. It is located between the Buina and Pontar rivers, bordered by Temeria to the south and Kovir and Caingorn to the north. To its east lies Kaedwen, and to its southeast - Aedirn. Its capital is Tretogor, yet the land's most famous cities are Oxenfurt, home to the enclave of culture and learning that is the Oxenfurt Academy, and Novigrad, which, while a free city, stands on Redanian soil.<br><br>The cult of the nobility runs strong in Redania. That social stratum possesses more privileges here than in any nearby realm. Great differences in wealth exist among the gentry, but Redanian law cares for birth not property, making a well-born beggar the legal equal of the richest magnate. Those of high birth and great wealth draw the latter primarily from the grain trade and pedigreed horse husbandry. This last the Redanians excel at, outdoing all other nations - Redanian steeds are unsurpassed. The Redanian cavalry is thus among the best formations of its kind in the world, and with the country's nobility filling its ranks it is the heart of the Redanian armed forces. As a consequence of the nobility's privileged position, the peasantry is treated worse here than in neighboring realms, and only the king’s iron fist keeps them from rebelling.<br><br>The Redanian army consists of thirty-five thousand armed men, which number includes a core of four thousand elite knights. Soon after the outbreak of the Third War against Nilfgaard, Redania’s forces were further supplemented with Temerian and Kaedweni regiments, as well as with mercenary troops from Poviss and Kovir. Indeed, one can now accurately speak of a united army of the North led by King Radovid V.<br><br>The Redanian treasury relies on the profitable trade with Novigrad to fill its coffers, with wheat as the chief staple crop and main commodity. Redania has it in abundance, thus the country is oft called the granary of the North, its landscape consisting almost entirely of rolling waves of grain. Yet despite the land's natural bounty, Redania's economy has been in crisis since war with Nilfgaard broke out once more. The tumult and desperation has led in recent days to the cult of the Eternal Fire gaining more and more adherents.

Yet that does not make it any less of a colossal and profound error.<br><br>Both forktails and wyverns are much, much smaller than dragons. True, they hunt animals in open fields, cattle in particular, just like those nobler beasts, but their behaviors and methods for dealing with potential prey could not be more different.

   1021722|de34ce1e||Freya Modron, the Great Mother, teaches us to put our faith in her no matter what life brings. Thus warriors pray to her before setting off for battle, and the women they leave behind pray for their menfolk’s safe return. Freya, as a mother and a goddess, understands all the trials of mankind, she sooths our pains and provides comfort. Yet woe to him who acts against her and violates her eternal laws, handed down for the good of men and the world. Condemnation awaits such men – they will be cut off from the life-giving source of motherly love, and if they repair not their ways and, renouncing evil, return to the mother-goddess’ bosom, they shall be cursed for all eternity – they and all their line (...)

   1080348|de3c5d46||We hunkered down for the night in a cave so enormous the light from our torches faded into the murky black without revealing any upper bound to it. For most of the night, all we could hear was the rushing of water somewhere behind the wall of the cave. Yet after some time (it is hard to say how much, for we had lost all sense of where day ended and night began) we heard a sort of scraping noise, and then the sound of boulders shifting.<br><br>The scraping turned to a roar, but by that time we were already on our feet and running towards the tunnel through which we had entered the cave. We did so none too soon, for the shifting had opened up a new passage in the cavern, which began to spew out hordes of small, misshapen humanoids. Without breaking stride I looked over my shoulder, and in the midst of the mass of midgets I spied the outline of a large, black troll.<br><br>Thus began our run for our lives.

   1135338|dfae5e1b||Greetings. Name's Krister Hegen. Tinkering's my trade. I've hung out a shingle here in Mohrin, at a man named Shaerk's place (I'm renting a room from him), so stop on by. I can guarantee you the best workmanship for unbeatable prices. So remember: Mohrin, Krister Hegen, Tinker, cheap.

   1021723|dfe9a6bd||And so, I, Jacob the Rebel, once well-known as a libertine and brawler extraordinaire from Nazair with its myriad taverns to the wilds of Zerrikania, used what strength I had left to pull my craft ashore. The raft I had strapped together out of an old boot, bits of strap and a burst barrel had taken on so much water that two ells more and I'd have sunk to the bottom. Instead, I stood on dry land, and that was all that mattered. With not a living soul in sight and my stomach growling something mighty, I began to explore. The isle was bereft of game, but offered fruit in great abundance. I ate so heartily the juice nearly poured out my ears, and then I began to gather wood with which to build my shelter for the night and fuel the fire that would warm me. <br><br>It was then I came upon the strange plant that would change my life till the end of my days. Ignorant of its value at this time, I frivolously used it for kindling. Yet as soon as it began to smolder and its sweet scent filled my nostrils, I felt light and the coastal breeze whisked all my troubles away.<br><br>I devoted the subsequent years of my life to researching this miraculous weed and its properties. As a result, I was able to develop a method that is likely to transform the life of any who puts it into practice. Here is how to begin… (…)

   1205908|e0b80b6a||It is hard to believe Toussaint, now so vibrant and full of life, once fell victim to a leprosy epidemic. To isolate the infected from the healthy, by ducal decree a leper colony was created on Crane Island. When all the colony’s inhabitants died, the complex gradually fell into ruin and the decision was made to adapt it into a prison, which it remains to this day.

Next day I found he’d eaten my larder bare, and had sniffed out where I keep the wine and drank every last drop. Had half a barrel left, no clue how he fit it all in his scrawny belly. Plus my daughter claims he fondled her during the night, and with both hands, too. This lying scoundrel said his name was Odrin, but who the devils knows what he’s truly called.

   1058564|e38f0523||You gotta give up this madness, Morgen. Mum's beside herself, saying that's not becoming of a Temerian, stealing from innocent folk. Bad enough you deserting the army like that, but to take to robbing... And how're you even sure you aren't hurting our own by accident? What happens if you and your mates make a mistake? You ever think about that? No, you didn't, ever since you were a lad you always acted first, thought later - or never. But you ain't a lad no more, so put an end to this reckless adventure and head home.

    441253|e3a31e17||What worries me most, brothers and sisters, is our moral decay. Townsmen disdain their marital beds, instead seeking out loose women to fulfill their manly desires. Their wives return the favor and look for any opportunity to cuckold them. Their children are either born bastards or dispatched with the help of witches. More folk flock to the so-called pleasure houses than to our temple, despite the fact that within their walls one is more likely to find rot than any pleasure. Men sleep with men, women with women, humans with nonhumans.<br><br>"What next?" I ask you. What will our depravity bring? Will man marry goat? Will premarital intercourse become a commonplace affair? No, brothers and sisters! The Eternal Fire must burn away these sins! The Fire - and only the Fire - can cleanse us!

When he traversed the isle for the first time and found no place worthy of making his seat, he asked Hemdall to give him the thickest chain he could forge. Once he received the chain, Grymmdjarr dove into the depths of the sea and used it to drag an enormous rock to the surface, placing it on Ard Skellig's north-eastern shore. Then he carved Kaer Trolde out of this rock with his bare hands, and there it stands to this day, the pride and glory of his clan.

   1108371|e5632e7b||I write in great haste, for each moment might bring my demise. A band of peasants wielding all manner of sharp or heavy farmyard implements has stormed the keep. I was in the workshop when they attacked, working on a new silver sword diagram, and did not notice the mob's approach. I have barricaded the doors but know this cannot last forever. I can only hope Varin will come and rescue me before they break through.<br><br>Luckily we completed work on a new steel sword diagram a few days ago and gave it to Varin to forge. Armed with this fine weapon and aided by his witcher pupils, I'm sure he'll easily handle a bunch of peasants swinging hoes and rakes. Yet even rakes can do great harm to an unarmed scholar such as my master. Hieronymus has been shut up in his tower for days, absorbed in his work on a new armor diagram. He might remain oblivious still to the danger he is in. Should the mob find him before Varin can slice them down... <br><br>And to think I nearly escaped this nightmare! If I had only listened to my master... Hieronymus had drawn up some notes for me on locations connected with the legendary Elgar, a witcher of the School of the Wolf. It is said Elgar had devised some improvements to the School's gear, and I was to follow his trail in search of these diagrams. Had I left even as late as yesterday, I would have been a safe distance from Kaer Morhen by the time the mob attacked. Instead, I tarried, and now I cower, fearing for my life...

They wouldn't even hear my report, thought me a specter trying to deceive them. Fuck that cult and their "common good" horseshit. How can I help the common good if I can't get the herbs I need? Speaking of, the sewant mushrooms won't do the trick. I already checked. Turns out the worst-case scenario was true. I'm not sick after all - I'm possessed.<br><br>The specter has fully fused into my body. Not even Quen has an effect. If only I had the right ingredients, I could brew my philter, intensify my signs and expel the filth with a combination of Yrden and Aard. But as I said, the cocksuckers won't fucking let me!<br><br>Guess you'll be reading these letters after all... I'll be waiting deep in the caverns. Make the potion but DO NOT COME NEAR ME UNTIL YOU DRINK IT. And don't substitute any ingredients or the red miasmal will possess you too.<br><br>Strange... "miasmal"? What is that?

He asked about the contract, then said he’d take it – for about as much coin as we’ve set aside for Fifi’s dowry. That’s some nerve! But I had no other choice – I had to agree.<br><br>18 May 1243<br>The witcher claims the problems are caused by some subterranean monster. He searched the area and found an entrance to a complex of caves by a stream in the Marcescent Forest. He plans to enter through it tomorrow.<br><br>20 May 1243<br>The witcher hasn’t returned. Some elf from the city asked about him. Now that’s some nerve, giving our address to nonhumans!<br><br>27 May 1243<br>Enough of this! I’ll never hire a witcher again! It will soon be ten days since he took his retainer and disappeared. I plan to sell the things he left behind to recover at least a portion of my losses. Too bad he mostly just left scraps with scribblings that no one will want to purchase.

I can't deny it, she is far from normal. When I visited her, I saw her sniff at a handful of straw as if it were the most irresistible of perfumes (I took a sniff as well, smelled just like a normal wisp of straw to me). She won't look you in the eye, but animals take to her like bees to honey. My tomcat is old and had been getting rather sickly. But after two days at the druidess', he's full of vim and vinegar once more! He chases mice like he used to and has a hearty appetite. Haven't seen a cat so happy in a long while!<br><br>Highly recommended!

Everywhere you turn, there's a jiggling rear end poking out from behind a tree, and there's no way to explain this to an impressionable child.

And it nearly was - until they found out the hard way high concentrations of flour in restricted spaces can lead to powerful dust explosions.

   1055941|eb9f2560||As for the genesis of ghouls, there are hypotheses aplenty. Some scholars claim these monstrosities arose from scoundrels who indulged in a taste for human flesh and for this misdeed drew the wrath of the heavens down upon themselves. The gods punished them by taking away their souls, their minds and their human forms.<br><br>My experiments have shown, however, that ghoul anatomy displays far too little in common with that of humans for this thesis to seem at all probable. Any and all similarity in appearance between ghouls and men, such as their somewhat kindred shapes and the measures of their physiognomies, are pure matters of incidental circumstance. It thus follows that ghouls, like their vile cousins the alghouls, are post-Conjunction creatures – that is to say, such beings as came to our universe in an abrupt cataclysm disrupting the normal laws of nature.

   1207914|ebc77843||[Journal is completely soaked, only a few entries can be deciphered]<br><br>Belhaven, 23rd Day of service<br>Nothing irritates me more than land rats thinking they’re cock of the walk. Yet Count Jean-Joel Baillairgé – that’s what the impertinent prick made me call him –managed to assuage my irritation a dab by clinking a hefty pouch of Nilfgaardian florens on the table... [illegible fragment] ...his entourage loaded the ship with bundles, then hauled on this huge cage covered with a sail. Count Baillairgé explained it held one of those famed Zanguebarian striped horses – a gift for Duchess Henrietta.<br><br>Belhaven to Beauclair Route, 24th Day of Service<br>We’ve had nothing but trouble with this Zanguebarian horse! It gnaws on the deck like a beast gone mad. Plus we’ve got to make sure the tarp covering its cage is tightly fastened, for it seems this creature’s as sensitive to the sun’s rays as a vampire! In which case, what good’s it to the duchess, a striped horse she can only ride it at night? There’s no comprehending these aristocrats… [illegible fragment]<br><br>Belhaven – Beauclair Route, 25th Day of Service<br>A thousand thundering sea devils! That was no horse in that cage, but a gods-blasted shaelmaar! Overgrown rock rat chewed through the deck, capsized the ship and burrowed into the river bottom! Then that idiot Count Baillairgé fell to his knees and begged me to help catch the monster. He handed me the key to the chest of jewels he’d kept close watch on the whole trip and swore it’d be mine if we recaptured that monstrosity. I’d most like to grab a thick club, smack him upside the head and take that chest right now, but I’m not some ploughing pirate. I’ll gather the lads who managed to survive the wreck and we’ll try to catch the monster in our nets – the count claimed to know some trickery to use to sneak up on the beast...

    477516|ec608ced||Brother druids,<br><br>Be forewarned that a sorceress has arrived on Ard Skellig. Her name is Yennefer and she hails from Vengerberg. I know you are immune to feminine wiles and will not let a well-draped skirt muddle your reasoning. Nevertheless, I warn you not to be taken in by her intelligence and refinement. I know who Yennefer is – I do not, however, know the true goal of her stay in Skellige. I see no point in asking her this question directly, for Yennefer is known for her cunning and eloquence. She says not what she thinks, but what she wishes you to hear. You must remember this is no second-rate sorceress. This is a person who breaks bread with the rulers of the North and who most recently has been working with the Nilfgaardian emperor himself. Familiar with courts the world over, she possesses an ability to manipulate that even the wiliest diplomat would envy.<br><br>Yennefer has displayed an unhealthy interest in the site of the cataclysm we are striving to study. I have not given her permission to go near it, but I caution you to keep your eyes and ears open all the same. The sorceress from Vengerberg is a stubborn and effective manipulator. I know that in the past her and Crach’s paths crossed. I suspect that she will wish to use this old friendship for some ulterior purpose. What that is, exactly… I will try to determine. Once I do, I will inform you in a separate letter.<br><br>May the Power be with you, Brothers<br>Ermion

   1206347|ed599e7f||The Noble Alondra is widely believed to be a mythical figure. Yet thanks to a painstaking analysis of the source materials, I have been able to establish beyond all doubt that the myth has roots in true events in which Alondra, a real woman of flesh and blood, took part.<br><br>What, then, do we know about the Noble Alondra? Dressed as a man and calling herself by a false name, she served as a squire. Just before being dubbed a knight, she revealed her true identity and was forced into exile. She lived in the desert and, as the mysterious Heron Knight, defended pilgrims. She fought at the Battle of Cervantes Pass, where she was badly wounded and taken to the field hospital, where she was recognized.<br><br>We know the duke, moved by her courage, dubbed her a knight and she then became the heroine of many tales which describe the righteousness of her character and generosity of her spirit.<br><br>Alondra’s disappearance remains shrouded in mystery.  The most popular legend claims the knight was summoned by the Lady of the Lake and journeyed to the bottom of the lake to see here, where she remains to this day, as the guardian of that subterranean domain.

   1061803|eda9be4c||Emhyr var Emreis rules to expand. He has trained his strategic brilliance on a singular vision - to conquer the world, though he rightly calls this not conquest, but salvation. Yes. The emperor of Nilfgaard sets the world alight with the torch of civilization.<br><br>Trampling the still-warm corpses of his father's usurpers, the emperor seized the throne and began to assimilate the Northern Realms, one after the other. Terror engulfed the North. Only the Battle of Brenna slowed the Imperial Army's march toward victory. A temporary peace then took hold, though none believed this mirage would last. Emhyr’s aim, to make the entire North a vassal of Nilfgaard, remained unchanged. Emhyr used peace as a cover to intensify his political efforts. Now all can see their results - chaos and disorder devour the Nordlings’ states. Ridden with internal bickering and backstabbing, they near collapse. Only a strong ruler can grapple this dysfunction into function. Only a wise ruler can give vision to their blindness. Only Emhyr var Emreis can save the North. So our armies have again crossed the Yaruga - for the third and final time…

The Beast’s dismembered corpse had been found in the river’s shallows, tangled in the man’s nets. The victim was identified as Count de la Croix.<br><br>The evidence suggesting this was the Beast’s third victim were the wounds to the body’s rib cage, which were dealt by long claws and constituted the immediate cause of death. It is not known why the Beast dismembered the body. Perhaps this was a matter of staging to provoke certain connotations, as in the case of the two previous victims.<br><br>No additional objects or tracks were found near the body. Count de la Croix’s personal effects most probably were carried off by the river’s current.

   1206246|f01383e1||Though Pomino does not enjoy the fame of Est Est or even Erveluce, it still attracts a considerable number of admirers and remains among the best wines in the world. Few, however, know how close the world came to losing its slightly acrid, surprisingly deep aftertaste. The cause of this averted disaster was Phylloxera Mortifera, that is to say, Phylloxera the Deadly, a species of aphid whose sudden attack nearly wiped out all existing vines of this variety. For many weeks no one was able to exterminate this pest and it seemed Pomino was doomed to extinction. In the end, however, the aphids were defeated by ducal alchemists and a carefully selected group of vintners was appointed to ensure its vines took root at Castel Ravello once more. Some experts from the time of the plague claim their restoration efforts introduced cross-contaminants and never again were they able to extract from this grape that same bottomless flavor as before.

   1122954|f1632238||There once was a young woman named Marlene and a young man named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was so handsome no maid could tear her eyes off him. Every maid in the village, from the fairest to the plainest, yearned to win his favor.<br><br>Marlene, too, was struck by his beauty and soon fell in love with him, as a love as deep as only a first love can be. This feeling was so overwhelming, Marlene realized she could never live without Bartholomew. Yet it was her misfortune that by then Bartholomew already had a wife and a young son.<br><br>Marlene refused to give in to this misfortune, however, and worked long and hard to convince Bartholomew that she was his one true love. In the end she succeeded, for women possess the gift of persuasion and many a man has succumbed to their entreaties.<br><br>Bartholomew’s wife refused to accept his change of heart. But Marlene found a way to deal with that as well.<br><br>Marlene convinced Bartholomew he must get rid of his wife once and for all, and so he chopped off her head. Everything would have ended well, with the young lovers living happily ever after, had not the crime been witnessed by Bartholomew’s five-year-old son. Marlene saw no other solution than to convince Bartholomew, by now her rightful husband, to dispose of the child like his mother and bury his body next to hers, so that they might be together for all eternity.<br><br>Yet this time Bartholomew put his foot down and refused to do what Marlene asked of him. “It is one thing to kill my wife, but to kill my child, the fruit of my loins?” he said. He only changed his mind when the lad began to speak, loudly and frequently, about what he had seen. And though Bartholomew could never raise his hand against his firstborn son, he found another way to deal with the problem. While the boy slept, he snuck into his room, lifted him up and set him in a coffin, which he then buried under the apple tree in their yard.<br><br>After that day, strange things began occurring in the area where the couple lived. The trees lost their leaves and stopped bearing fruit. Folk dwelling nearby were hounded by evil dreams. One by one they fled their homes and farmsteads, until only Marlene and Bartholomew were left.<br><br>One day Marlene dreamt the boy had awoken in his casket under the apple tree and begun to cry. She yearned to have a child of her own and such dreams troubled her greatly. She thus took a spade and dug up the coffin. Inside she found the child’s body, but its arms or legs were missing. She thought the poor lad must have gnawed them off from wild hunger before he died. The sight of the child’s mangled torso so terrified Marlene she reburied the coffin at once and never said a word about it to her husband.<br><br>They lived together a great many years afterwards, but theirs was not a good life. Bartholomew had changed. He slowly stopped cherishing Marlene, and then stopped speaking. He hanged himself on the night of the summer solstice, leaving his wife alone with her dreams. Before she died, Marlene dug up the child’s coffin one more time. No one knows where she went and what she did with it. Their lands have lain deserted ever since. No plants will grow there, and no birds sing.<br><br>Wilhelm & Jacob G.

In his youth, his story went, he served as squire to a knight errant and together they defeated a bloodthirsty cockatrice. The beast’s head decorated the auberge’s entrance for many years until a certain traveler from Oxenfurt ascertained it was unfortunately but a rather amateurish hobbling together of pheasant, weasel and pig parts. His pride wounded, de Guy took down his trophy, but the inn kept its name.

They quickly spread across all the Continent, trying to adapt to their new situation. According to legend, one of them, Khagmar, settled in Toussaint. Grim tales are whispered about his deeds, but whether he truly even existed is hard to say. The tales do agree on one thing, however: Khagmar’s story is inextricably tied to the mysterious fortress known as Tesham Mutna.

No doubt you wonder why I have drawn you out here, and why we cannot meet in person. You see, in my present situation, any kind of meeting is very risky – not so much for me, as for the person with whom I meet, for I am afflicted by a curse, or (as I hope, and why I have turned to you), the side effects of medicine given to me some time ago by a herbalist.<br><br>Soon after I visited this herbalist, she disappeared without trace. I desperately wish to understand my illness, so I wish to hire you to find her. When you do, learn as much from her as you can about the medicine she gave me. If my suffering is a result of her wickedness, then make her provide an antidote. I assure you I have ample wealth and will reward you with no small part of it for your services.<br><br>If it turns out my suffering is not the fault of the herbalist, please let her go. I will then have a different task for you, because this shall mean I am afflicted by a terrible curse which only the gods can cure. I believe it was cast upon me by a certain beggar who came by the manor while I was hosting a soiree for a few friends. If you can find that vagrant, I will pay you double. Sadly, all I remember of him is that he sold mirrors. I am aware this is not much aid for your hunt, yet I trust in your considerable talents and wish you the best of luck.<br><br>Marlene de Trastamara

   1087425|f22f8341||What time of year is the best for visiting Ard Skellig? Any time. To whom is such a sojourn recommended? To anyone who seeks adventure, craves miraculous views and adores charming villages. These last Ard Skellig has in spades: it is the most densely-inhabited isle in the archipelago, though this does not mean it lacks virgin forests or untrammeled landscapes. Particularly worthy of a visit are the villages of Rannvaig, Arinbjorn and, last but not least, Holmstein, one of the most important ports in all the Isles.<br><br>Anyone lucky enough to enjoy the sea voyage to Arinbjorn will surely notice the majestic lighthouse guiding ships to its harbor. Built at the behest of the famed Jarl Skjordal, it constitutes one of the most fascinating spots on the isle and offers breathtaking views of the entire region.<br><br>The most spectacular vista on Ard Skellig, however, must certainly be that of Kaer Trolde, a fortress cut out of the mountain overlooking the bay and serving as home seat to the powerful an Craite clan. According to legend, Grymmdjarr, mythical Skellige hero and founder of Clan an Craite, carved the fortress with his bare hands (for more on this, see the "History" and "Culture" sections).

   1068459|f254740c||Such is my quest - to wander the villages of this fair land of Velen singing the praises of Maid Bilberry. I shall bring due fame to her unequalled beauty and unparalleled charms. Maid Bilberry is without a doubt the most intelligent, most understanding and most compassionate of all creatures to walk this our imperfect world. I shall immediately and with full prejudice correct any man who dares to claim otherwise. The most stubborn and foolhardy of these ignorami shall taste of my family blade. Indeed, just the other day I came across a certain gentleman fondling some tart and having the cheek to call her "my most beautiful little flower." This enraged me so egregiously that I decided to explain to the fool the magnitude of his error, but he refused to listen, and when I insisted further, he fled. This truly is a land of cowards. I shall not rest until I've convinced all the locals that they should direct their compliments to Maid Bilberry - and only Maid Bilberry.

   1126469|f2e3df17||Kulik Kulikov and his men are busy preparing the hunt, so I’ve a few moments to write up this whole incredible affair.<br><br>Week back I arrived home in Oxenfurt after a long journey and found I’d received a letter from my barrister. My aunt Helena had finally passed on and left all her belongings, including her hut outside Novigrad, to me. The letter included a copy of her will and a key to the chest in which she had stashed her savings. Remembering how my dear auntie would serve her guests only bread and water, I was sure she’d managed to save up a hefty stash of coin during her long and miserly life. So I raced off in a flash to my aunt’s hut, to pay my respects at her grave, and while there, take a gander at what’s in that chest. But when I got there, the hut was in ruins and the neighboring peasants were claiming a griffin had nested on my aunt’s lands. So there I was, a fortune in arm’s reach, and not a way to get at it. So I went back to Oxenfurt and raced to the Alchemy, fast as my feet would take me, for I’d heard the famous Kulik Kulikov and his crew were watering their horses there after their latest adventure. We agreed terms quick enough (he’d get a portion of what we found in the chest) and set off to exterminate this ploughing pest of a griffin.<br><br>Now I’m sitting and watching Kulikov’s lads arm the ballista, writing this all down to calm my nerves and pass the time.<br><br>Fun’s about to start!

Not that I don't trust you, but the gods help those who help themselves, as the Kaedweni saying goes.<br><br>Getting straight to your question: Princess Adda's curse could indeed be caused to return. The witcher from Rivia had only a rudimentary knowledge of magic arcana, and so was not able to fully remove the spell, and instead only temporarily disrupted its workings.<br><br>For Adda to become a striga once more, one would have to sprinkle her food with three drops of blood from her father, King Foltest, three drops of blood from a wolf and three drops of bile from a freshly-buried woman, one who died having finished one hundred years but not yet having started her hundred and first. Then one must cast the Incepted Triangle over the meal thus prepared. That should do the trick - yet please consider carefully whether you truly wish to carry out such an ignoble deed.<br><br>Hoping to do business again with you in the future,<br><br>-Alyssandra Deviel

   1058758|f48914f5||Running through many folk tales is a common motif of travel between worlds. By way of example, think of Orphelius, who ventured into the nether realms to save his beloved, Theodor, who, fleeing a hurricane, found himself in the drab and monotonous world of Zo, or Ecila, who tumbled down a ferret hole into a land that had never heard of wonder. Also of this ilk are the many rural legends about people captured by the Wild Hunt, only to return to their homelands after years riding the sky with the spectral cavalcade.<br><br>Academia has, for the most part, dismissed these tales as mere epiphenomena of human irrationality. I, on the other hand, always operate on the assumption that a grain of truth lies in every tale - and so have decided to make it my goal to find it. After years of research, I have ascertained with great certainty that travel between worlds was once indeed possible - though only to a select few.<br><br>The key is the so-called “Elder Blood” - or rather, to use the scholarly term, the gene of Lara Dorren, the powerful elven sorceress. By comparing her genealogical tables against all known folk tales I have been able to determine that she and her descendants were the archetype of the worlds-traveling heroes of many legends. The bearers of Lara’s gene possessed an extraordinary talent which allowed them to move through time and space and to reach realms beyond the borders of the known world. The overwhelming majority of them, however, did not know how to control this. It would only manifest itself in extreme situations, pushed out by sudden bursts of emotion or when the bearer’s life was at risk.<br><br>That is how the above-mentioned Orphelius, in shock after the death of his wife, could in fact journey to another world, which he foolishly mistook for the afterlife. The hurricane provided the pressure needed for Theodor, terrorized at home by his zany Uncle En, to unleash his talent and teleport to a world free from madcap antics. And if we read between the lines, we clearly see Ecila was a prostitute and a fisstech addict - the “ferret hole” represents how, when she had reached rock bottom, she whisked herself away to another universe to get sober.<br><br>Unfortunately for any future Ecilases, the sad conclusion of my research is this: Lara Dorren’s line has been irrevocably cut off. The last bearer of her gene, Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon, heiress to the throne of Cintra, died childless many years ago.

A small trappers’ post located on its outskirts has grown into the tranquil village known as Francollarts. Here hunters, woodcutters and beekeepers come to sell the fruit of the woods. The village springs to life once a year, when Baron Trastamara organizes his annual Wood Festival and invites all the court out for a spectacular hunt.

The outbreak of war brought Redanian troops to the city, King Radovid at their head. The university dorrs were shut and locked, the students were driven out, and the entire town began to feel like an extension of the infamous prison located within its walls.

   1061924|f7269743||During my many travels I have seen countless extraordinary places - the primeval wilds of Brokilon, with trees so high their tips disappear in the clouds, dwarven chambers carved into the guts of the Mahakam Mountains, with walls plated in pure gold, the ice palace of Pont Vanis, adorned with stained-frost windows - yet none of these made such an impression on me as did the rightly-famed Zerrikania.<br><br>Yet while I was traversing the Fiery Mountains, I feared disappointment awaited me on the other side. I had heard many a fantastic tale about Zerrikania - about its trackless sands, burnt white by the sun, its golden-scaled dragons, weaving their nests amidst the dunes, its hunch-backed horses able to survive weeks without even a swallow of water - yet none seemed to me at all plausible. I was sure all these sensations were but the figments of some bard’s overactive imagination.<br><br>I know this will be as hard for you to believe, dear reader, as it once was for me - but all of the unbelievable tales are true. Not only that - during my many months of travel I came across wonders far surpassing those any prior travelogues mentioned. I saw temples dedicated to the worship of dragons. I heard their voice, almost human, but reverberating with a thousand echoes. I met warrior maids clad in leopard skins, tattooed from head to foot and giving no ground to witchers in mastery of the blade. I saw mages who channeled Power from fire. I saw seemingly harmless flies whose solitary bite would make a man fall into a deep slumber, never to awake save to die. In short, Zerrikania is a land where the fantastic is normal, and the impossible occurs daily…

Don't ask how - modesty prevents me from trumpeting the heroic deeds I performed in the fight for our beloved fatherland. At any rate there's so damned much of it that there's no way in any hell I'll carry it back on my own, so I’ve put everything in a chest and buried it on the beach, at the base of the cliff with the two burned-out huts on it. You know, we'd go crayfish hunting there, remember?<br><br>So here's what you’ve got to do: grab a wheelbarrow, throw a shovel in it and take it to the beach - but make sure no one sees you.

The first rode a steed the color of fog, the second of sulfur, the third black as the abyss, and the fourth – a pony.<br><br>And then I beheld a fountain, a clear spring, but the Princes did not drink of it, for it was forbidden.<br><br>And then a Bird of Paradise, shining in ruby and gold, flew above them and alit upon the branch of a tree. And the tree had arms numbering a thousand and forty.<br><br>”Draw from the source,” said the Bird, but they pointed to the Sun’s bloody tears and did not draw.<br><br>And then a pure Virgin appeared with bared breast, exposing her modest bosoms, ruddy and firm like ripe linden berries.<br><br>Then my nose became accustomed to the aroma and the vision passed.<br><br>Tomorrow I shall try to unseal that well-aged sample from Genno Myvort. It is said to have a refined, deep scent with slightly nutty aftertastes. Well. We shall see.

They should either send more men or let you retreat. Tell that to those brilliant generals of yours! High time someone talked some sense into them. You might only be a Corporal Treasurer, but if you lay it all out to them calmly, I'm sure they'll listen to reason.<br><br>Be careful out there, sweetie. Always wear a helmet to battle and put on those thick socks I sent when you go to bed. From what I've heard, it's always cold and rainy in the North, so remember to look after your health!<br><br>-Your Dweffren<br><br>P.S. Darling, do you think you'll win the war by Midinváerne?

The story of his alcohol-fueled romps number today among the most cherished of traditional Toussaint tales. This state of perpetual tipsiness might just be what drove his decision to surround the duchy with a series of castles, meant to protect Toussaint from the barbarous highlanders of Mount Gorgon. Thing is, no one has ever heard of such a folk.

   1077091|f9d97cae||Those were the days... You'd smuggle a few bottles of hooch into Oxenfurt, then loiter about the dormitories selling it to students. You'd come away with a hefty sack of coin, and they'd have their spirits fortified for study. Then along came Radovid, who shut down the university, chased the students away and positioned ballistae on the riverbank to sink everything floating up or down the Pontar, swans included.<br><br>But there's not been a dark cloud yet that didn't have a silver lining. Yesterday I saw our brave soldiers sink a merchant vessel. Went straight to the bottom, it did, along with its whole crew... and its cargo. A shame about the men, really, but it would just as big a shame to let all those goods go to waste. So me and Martin will fish them out, dry them off and sell them - and maybe at last I'll have something to put in my pot.

I understand it's an honor to die in battle – but that weren't no battle. 'Twas a a slaughter! He exiled us, the bloated walrus, the siren and troll-spawned miscreant… And so off we went, but not empty-handed. Since he weren't using his ancestral horn to sound no retreat anyways, not even when his shield bearers were dying like flies, well, we took it off his hands. Kjarre took the horn with him and went north, into the fjords, where pirates and smugglers cast anchor atimes – says maybe they'll buy it off us… and then Mathios will never find it. Good. He didn't say a word in our defense when Holger was driving us off, so let him go out in a blaze of shame and disgrace.

Sadly, it turned out his master builders were as fond of the bottle as he, the result being structural flaws in the building’s foundations. The sloppily-placed stones proved unable to bear the weight of the walls and the castle collapsed. Many years later the ruins were reconstructed into a small fort to house knights protecting the high road, but currently it lies empty and abandoned.

In 1178 the structure was restored so it could stage the works of Beauclair’s most renowned theatrical virtuosos. Unfortunately, its grand opening was marred by an unplanned tragic ending: the mysterious death of the play’s leading lady.

   1063961|fc92150d||Each foe slain accelerates Vitality regeneration for the duration of the battle.
   1063962|fc92150e||Whenever a single hit drains more than a third of Vitality, a Quen shield is activated which protects against the next attack.
   1055158|fc921524||Increases the witcher's resistance to Vitality-depleting critical effects applied during combat. The resistance level rises the longer the critical effect is applied.

    459339|fced51c0||I, Kjarre, son of Knut, have twice disgraced myself. First by running from the field of battle out of fear of dying. The shield I abandoned then rests on the bottom of that marsh, and there it will stay until Ragh nar Roog, as testimony of my cowardice. The second time was when Orn Two Heads convinced me to help him steal Holger Blackhand’s horn. Orn thought I’d sell the horn to smugglers, but I won’t. If I’m to live like a thief and a bandit, I prefer not to live at all. The one thing I can do to regain my honor is to return the horn to where it belongs, to its ancestral home. Mathios, who Holger charged with getting the horn back, has family near these cliffs. I hope he’ll come here for the equinox festival. Then I’ll be able to give him back the stolen horn and ask for him to vouch for me with the jarl. That’s all the hope I have left.
