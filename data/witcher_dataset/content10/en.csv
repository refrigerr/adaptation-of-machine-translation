   1025017|00000000||Get out!
   1047646|00000000||They just keep coming!
   1047648|00000000||We can't hope to defeat them all!
   1047650|00000000||As soon as the portal opens, you must jump in after me!
    569327|00000000||Oh boy.
    569320|00000000||Anyone home?
    572535|00000000||Who're you?
    569322|00000000||Friends. Are your parents home?
    569323|00000000||Aye, but they're busy. Mum's after Pa with the fryin' pan. 'Cause he, uh… bubbered this lady?
    572546|00000000||Ahem. Fucked.
    569324|00000000||I see. We shan't bother them. Will you let us in?
    572548|00000000||I will.
    454814|00000000||At last.
    538457|00000000||This Tir ná Lia?
    454816|00000000||The Palace of Awakening, formerly the Moon Palace. Ge'els' headquarters.
    569351|00000000||Mummy!
    454824|00000000||{Que aynimm rhovir'le? } [What will you title it?]
    312001|00000000||{No rhovir'le. } [I will not.]
    312005|00000000||{Ledwedd varlledu cyall, no ghar. } [Paintings should convey emotion, not words.]
    312007|00000000||{Emw a ledwedd... es dallistro thrbíoch, que déacum'le elaine. } [To title a painting… is to destroy the multiplicity of meanings that render it beautiful.]

    170734|00017dcc||Boy
   1008086|00000000||Avallac'h?
   1009442|00000000||Great. Gotta find the next passage on my own.
   1008085|00000000||Another wilderness?
    538231|00000000||What is this world?
    538345|00000000||Where are we? World of the Aen Elle?
    538428|00000000||No. This is Tedd Deireadh, the Time of the End. The world destroyed by the White Frost.
    538429|00000000||Alas, this awaits us all, though at differing stages of our existence.
    584026|00000000||So calm when you say that…
    584028|00000000||Eredin succumbed to his knowledge of the apocalypse. Fear rules him now. I'll not commit the same error.
    584030|00000000||Care to clarify?
    584032|00000000||Not here, not now.
    585952|00000000||Why is Ge'els so important?
    585954|00000000||Going after Ge'els is proving quite a trek, but I still don't know why he's so important.
    585956|00000000||Eredin differs from the king he killed. Power for its own sake interests him. He has little patience for bureaucracy.
    585958|00000000||He spends most of his time atop his steed, leading the Red Riders. So what does he need in the capital? A good viceroy.
    585960|00000000||Ge'els is an excellent administrator and an even better plotter. He's the most dangerous individual amongst the Aen Elle.
    585962|00000000||He got any weaknesses?
    585964|00000000||Yes. He's righteous.
    513363|00000000||Took you a while. Did you run into trouble?
    538207|00000000||Erm, no. Just taking in the sights.
   1010785|00000000||What is this place? Feels like I've been here before.
   1010787|00000000||You have. You fought Eredin's projection here. Before that, Ciri fought here. For you.
   1010788|00000000||What're you talking about?
   1010789|00000000||Ever wondered how you managed to leave the Red Riders?
   1010790|00000000||Many times, but I don't remember a thing.
   1010865|00000000||Ciri came for you. She sensed you were in danger, tore you from the Hunt's grasp, then deposited you in the woods near Kaer Morhen.
   1010867|00000000||Did Eredin start hunting her because of that? Because of me? Why didn't she say anything?
   1010869|00000000||Ugh. What would it have changed?
   1010905|00000000||Where did your journey take you?
   1010907|00000000||I was hoping we wouldn't get separated.
   1010909|00000000||I warned you it could happen.
    538234|00000000||Where'd your journey take you?
    538356|00000000||Through a world whose sun had just died. I barely reached the next passage in time.
   1026260|00000000||That light on the peak - you put it there?
   1026261|00000000||Light on the peak - was that you?
   1026262|00000000||I thought it might aid your passage. After all, that is what lighthouses do - show the way.
    538230|00000000||Let's go.
    584900|00000000||Doesn't look safe here, either. Let's go.
    538442|00000000||This way.
   1042827|00000000||Next passage - when will it open?
   1023398|00000000||Shortly.
    582346|00000000||Yennefer, if this is untrue…
    584241|00000000||It's true.
    454427|00000000||We're close.
    454717|00000000||Ready to travel to another world?
    548834|00000000||Found the passage?
    548836|00000000||Yes, step over here.
    568595|00000000||I know this house.
    568597|00000000||Supposed to drive a godling from here.
    572896|00000000||Supposed to?
    572898|00000000||Decided it was harmless.
    568596|00000000||Met a godling pretending to be a ghost here. Drove her out.
    568635|00000000||Hmm, then we might run into it. Along with the person who's agreed to help us.
    454120|00000000||What then? What'll we do with Ge'els?
    534847|00000000||Plan to talk to him and that's that?
    534849|00000000||Words alone won't convince him. But I think Miss Tilly's oneiromancy might.
    582438|00000000||He seems to have aged…
    582439|00000000||Witchers don't age.
    584650|00000000||But he looks more serious, more grave somehow.
    584652|00000000||He's had more than his share of concerns…
    584654|00000000||Sh, he's coming.
   1009380|00000000||No reason to tarry, come.
    582466|00000000||All are present. You were the last to arrive. Might we set sail?
    582469|00000000||Anchors aweigh.
    582467|00000000||Yes, let's go.
    582470|00000000||Wait here, forgot something.
    582468|00000000||Gimme a minute.
    570282|00000000||Not in the mood.
    570345|00000000||Didn't come here for tea.
    312230|00000000||No, but it doesn't matter.
    312238|00000000||No. But honesty's not a facet of your species. So quit spewing bile, won't gain you anything.
    312240|00000000||Shut your mouth or I'll shove a gag in it.
    312099|00000000||This way, please.
    312103|00000000||Better believe it. This way, please.
    312220|00000000||Witcher Geralt, a true man of action. Might I know where we're going?
    312242|00000000||To the world of the Aen Seidhe.
    570724|00000000||Directly, this time.
    570584|00000000||Let's go. Before any guards show up.
    312101|00000000||Tired of your pseudo-sophisticated courtesy. Let's go.
    312218|00000000||Where to, if I might ask?
    312097|00000000||Talked enough, let's go.
    570360|00000000||I detect a shadow of impatience in your faces, it seems. So, what brings you here?
    312074|00000000||I've come to tell you who killed our king.
    570363|00000000||You've gone through a great deal of trouble to reach me…
    570566|00000000||So I must believe you've put equal effort into preparing this lie.
    312082|00000000||You shall see the truth. You will dream it.
    312084|00000000||You've an oneiromancer? Hmph.
   1084781|00000000||My intuition was correct - this will be interesting.
    312234|00000000||I think that even among the Aen Elle elves there are those capable of being decent.
    312236|00000000||Naïvety is a fool's blessing…
    312228|00000000||Yes, he's honest.
    570347|00000000||Hmm… I must admit, you appearing here - quite the surprise, witcher.
    570356|00000000||Incidentally, interesting choice of allies. Do you think Avallac'h is honest with you? Just curious…
    570329|00000000||Got any vodka?
    570344|00000000||Oh, yeah, keep forgetting you don't touch that filth, disgraceful as it is.
    570281|00000000||Be glad to have a drink.
    312072|00000000||Crevan Espane aep Caomhan Macha and the witcher of Rivia. Ceádmil.
    312224|00000000||Do you like my new model? Something of Lara Dorren about her, wouldn't you agree, Crevan?
    570188|00000000||Her height, perhaps. Nothing more.
    570212|00000000||Ah, I see I've touched a tender spot… So let's change the subject, shall we? Care for a drink?
    570111|00000000||Oh! Who's this? And why are they here?
    568674|00000000||I believe we're done for the day, my tulip. Be a dear and leave us alone.
    570150|00000000||For I think we can agree this matter is between us and us alone, correct?
   1041855|00000000||Hmm… beautiful.
   1041857|00000000||I'm glad to know you appreciate it. Elven architecture is a bit more sophisticated than yours.
    569347|00000000||Don't know why Mum's so angry with Pa.
    572674|00000000||Pa's real nice.
    572676|00000000||Stinks o' gin and piss sometimes.
    572678|00000000||But he brought me some new toys today.
    572680|00000000||Wooden blocks and a three-wheeled cart.
    572682|00000000||Shame the wheels are missin'…
   1074542|00000000||Just as well, could've been bluffing. Might've just said that so we'd let him go.
   1074544|00000000||Dammit. We should've pressed him.
   1074546|00000000||Calm down. Avallac'h knows him better. We'll hear him out when he returns.
   1074548|00000000||Speak of the devil.
   1074550|00000000||Geralt's worried. He believes we let Ge'els go too easily.
   1074652|00000000||Can never be too careful.
   1074654|00000000||Agreed. Yet I do believe Ge'els will keep his word, withhold support from Eredin.
   1074650|00000000||Just wanna be careful.
   1074649|00000000||I don't trust him.
    585866|00000000||He got off cheap and easy… Sold us a few pieces of advice, some story about a Sunstone…
    305315|00000000||He gave us his assurance that he'll not support Eredin. And that is quite a lot.
   1074656|00000000||Seems to me you have a plan. Care to share it with us?
   1074658|00000000||Once we find the Sunstone, aided by your sorceresses and their magic, we shall draw Eredin's ship to a bay along the coast of Undvik.
   1074660|00000000||We will wait in ambush. Lay a trap. When the King of the Hunt arrives, we will spring it and kill him.
   1074662|00000000||Just like that?
   1074664|00000000||Defeating Eredin will be no small feat, but we will accomplish it.
    305293|00000000||I take it I needn't introduce our guest.
    305301|00000000||Greetings, Zireael. So it's true - the Swallow has befriended the Fox.
    305303|00000000||There's naught you can do to make us turn on one another.
    305305|00000000||Avallac'h blackmailed you - do you not remember? Tried to force you to warm our king's bed?
    570793|00000000||Treated your body like a side of pork.
    312716|00000000||I remember. But I also remember what you advised Eredin do with me once I was caught. And I remember what the Red Riders did at Kaer Morhen.
    312743|00000000||I didn't come here to argue. The proof you promised, where is it?
    312745|00000000||You will see it. In your dream.
    312747|00000000||Ah yes, the oneiromancer. Visions that cannot be fabricated. Do you wish to show me how Eredin murdered our king?
    539115|00000000||What then? Am I to incite the Aen Elle against Eredin? Call for revolution and proclaim Avallac'h our new king?
    313048|00000000||You'll do what you want. If you decide to continue serving the regicide, so be it. Wouldn't even be surprised.
    312763|00000000||You'll do what you want.
    312755|00000000||No. Defy Eredin, that's all.
    313046|00000000||Don't flatter yourself. Defy Eredin, that's all you need to do.
    313086|00000000||Very well. Have your oracle summon dreams of my king's last moments.
    313088|00000000||We shall all dream them. To make certain there are no misunderstandings.
    313090|00000000||Why not.
    312654|00000000||The king is dead. Long live the king.
    539127|00000000||You must face him on your terms, in this world, in a place of your choosing. It's your only chance.
    539195|00000000||Sail to Skellige and find the Sunstone. With it, you will summon the Naglfar. Eredin will come, too.
    585868|00000000||Should he call for reinforcements, no Aen Elle will answer.
   1063146|00000000||You have done the thing most just.
   1074534|00000000||A new portal to Tir ná Lia will open. I shall stabilize it, and you will return. Come with me.
    539374|00000000||Find the sorceresses of the Lodge and we'll meet at the port. Then we sail to Skellige.
    313080|00000000||Gather everyone and we'll meet at the port. Then we sail to Skellige.
   1005844|00000000||Welcome to the Ddiddiwedht Desert.
   1009406|00000000||This somewhere in our world?
   1009408|00000000||Ever seen such canyons in your world?
   1009410|00000000||Come, we must go.
   1022644|00000000||Ah, the portal.
   1022645|00000000||Looks more like a ruin.
   1022646|00000000||Appearances can be deceiving.
   1042745|00000000||So what're we waiting for?
   1042747|00000000||For it to open. Shouldn't take but a few moments.
   1047393|00000000||What's going on?
   1047395|00000000||The sandcrabs have sensed our presence.
   1022647|00000000||Wonderful.
   1022665|00000000||Three, two, one… Very good. On time.
   1042783|00000000||What a relief.
   1047402|00000000||Quickly! Jump in!
   1047404|00000000||Faster, Geralt!
   1022657|00000000||What is this place?
   1042751|00000000||A very old world, thoroughly raped and destroyed.
   1042753|00000000||Anything live here?
   1042755|00000000||Mainly desert creatures able to survive months on end without water.
   1042757|00000000||Oh, and large sandcrabs, beneath the surface.
   1047389|00000000||We must be careful they don't sense us.
   1042759|00000000||And before? Were there any… people? Or elves?
   1042761|00000000||Do you believe humanoids have a monopoly on destroying worlds?
   1042763|00000000||So what did live here? Sentient monsters of some sort?
   1042765|00000000||Look at those cliffs. Remind you of anything?
   1042767|00000000||Hmm… Look a bit like the bed of a giant river.
   1042769|00000000||Or the bottom of a sea.
   1042773|00000000||Mean there were water creatures here once?
   1042775|00000000||No creatures. Merely a sea.
   1042771|00000000||Trying to say that…?
   1042777|00000000||That there are many different worlds, and even more forms of life.
   1042779|00000000||Many of them intelligent, much more so, in fact, than you humans.
   1042781|00000000||But as it turns out, not even that could stop them from exhausting all the resources of their world. To the last drop.
   1005828|00000000||Where are we?
    584372|00000000||Emperor hid that from you?
    584417|00000000||Hmm… Take it the emperor forgot to tell you about this?
    584363|00000000||I don't like it. That was not our deal. When it's all over, I'll need to have a candid discussion with the emperor.
    584365|00000000||Come, they're all waiting for us.
    584360|00000000||How's Rita know? Barely got out of prison herself.
    584362|00000000||She spoke to Fringilla before they imprisoned her. Fringilla said that the emperor had summoned her and she'd explain why after the meeting.
    584408|00000000||No one's heard from her since.
    584410|00000000||Thought this kinda drama only happened around Radovid.
    584371|00000000||How would Rita know?
    584301|00000000||Bit about Fringilla - what was that? Triss told me you couldn't contact her.
    584356|00000000||Perhaps because she sits in the emperor's dungeon, chained in dimeritium.
    584358|00000000||At least that's what Rita implied.
    584289|00000000||What was that bit about Fringilla?
    584290|00000000||Secured them amnesty? Really?
    584292|00000000||I hear right? You convince the emperor to pardon them?
    584294|00000000||Provided they help us defend Ciri.
    584296|00000000||Hmm… Got a hard time believing emperor'd go in for a deal like that.
    584298|00000000||If you can't believe it, don't. I don't need you to.
    584243|00000000||Help protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt, and the emperor will grant you amnesty.
    584250|00000000||I hope we can trust you.
    584252|00000000||You can.
    582347|00000000||What of Fringilla?
    582348|00000000||That I don't know… But I shall take it up with him.
    582394|00000000||You've barely said hello and you're already plotting something.
    582395|00000000||It's clearly in our nature.
   1045380|00000000||Snow's up to the rooftops, wonder how long this blizzard's been blowing.
    532897|00000000||Need a hanky? Gotta admit, never expected this of you…
    532899|00000000||You humans have… hm, unusual tastes.
    532901|00000000||How did you fare on Bald Mountain?
    532903|00000000||Need to ask? You're a Sage.
    532905|00000000||I ask as a courtesy. A concept you clearly forgot when you left without uttering a word.
    550887|00000000||Ciri was in a hurry.
    550888|00000000||I know, so she wrote in her letter. But that is not my concern. You eliminated Imlerith adeptly. So adeptly you might say you inspired me…
    533892|00000000||Skip the guessing games, I'm tired.
    532907|00000000||Be straight with me.
    532906|00000000||What've you got in mind?
    533890|00000000||Meaning?
    533895|00000000||The loss of one of his great generals has weakened Eredin. Significantly. Two others remain.
    533923|00000000||How do we get rid of them?
    534030|00000000||Caranthir is a loyalist, but Ge'els - that is another story.
    539031|00000000||He was a devoted follower of our former king…
    534033|00000000||And as it happens, Eredin poisoned our beloved ruler.
    539044|00000000||How do you know it was Eredin?
    539046|00000000||How do you know? Or are you bluffing?
    539047|00000000||Eredin made sure very few individuals knew of his betrayal. Most are now dead.
    539092|00000000||Didn't answer my question.
    539059|00000000||"How" matters not. What matters is I know - and I've an idea how to use this knowledge.
    565519|00000000||You make it sound important. So, guess it's not exactly common knowledge…
    565521|00000000||I'd even call it a secret.
    565546|00000000||How'd he manage to hide it?
    565548|00000000||Oh, I assure you, he's excellent at covering his tracks - though not terribly subtle.
    565554|00000000||But I'm even better at uncovering them.
    534144|00000000||Who knows this?
    534121|00000000||Think Ge'els would betray Eredin?
    534152|00000000||Regicide - serious stuff… Take it not many know about this?
    565525|00000000||Of the living - only I. And Eredin, of course.
    565526|00000000||Question is, can you get Ge'els to believe you?
    534154|00000000||Nothing you need worry about.
    565572|00000000||Think you can make a deal with Ge'els?
    565583|00000000||Haven't mentioned killing Ge'els…
    565584|00000000||Such drastic means are not always necessary.
    565585|00000000||So, you probably plan to offer him a deal.
    565592|00000000||Brilliant deduction, bravo.
    534472|00000000||What do you intend to do?
    534473|00000000||I'd rather kill Ge'els than make a deal.
    539106|00000000||How can you be sure Ge'els'll believe you?
    534478|00000000||Wanna deal, talk to him, trust him? I'd rather just kill him.
    534479|00000000||That is precisely one of the reasons why Ge'els abhors your world. Your senseless brutality.
    534705|00000000||At times one must use reason, rather than blades.
    534334|00000000||Fine, so what do you propose?
    534474|00000000||Why, to bring Ge'els here, show him the truth of what happened.
    534475|00000000||Fabulous plan - if we only knew where to find him.
    565596|00000000||We do. In the land of the Aen Elle.
    565597|00000000||Land of the Aen Elle? What's that?
    565607|00000000||Land of the Aen Elle?
    565609|00000000||You don't recall? After all, you did travel with Eredin for some time.
    565614|00000000||The land of the Alder Folk. The world where we arrived centuries ago, a world that is now our home.
    583984|00000000||The Red Riders come from there. And it is there where we will find Ge'els.
    565605|00000000||How do you mean to get there?
   1042836|00000000||Think you're forgetting something - you and Ciri might know how to travel between worlds. But me, not so much.
    534476|00000000||You clearly know there are many other worlds apart from the one where we now stand.
    565632|00000000||They're linked by passages, hidden gateways that afford travel from one world to another.
    534514|00000000||Of course, few know of these gateways, even fewer can locate them.
    534483|00000000||Elven Sages, for example?
    534484|00000000||For example. One such passage will open soon, near where we are, fortuitously enough. Between this noble edifice and the Butchers' Yard.
    565798|00000000||That's our chance. Shall we go?
    456130|00000000||Meet you there. Gotta see to something along the way.
    534746|00000000||Hurry. I'd rather not loiter in the street any longer than necessary.
    534734|00000000||Meet you there.
    534671|00000000||Let's go now.
    534749|00000000||Let's go.
    569341|00000000||What's she got that I don't, eh? She better with a broom? Like her cookin'?
    569342|00000000||Her arse! That's what's better!
    572758|00000000||You soft-cock fool!
    572760|00000000||Oh, I beg to differ! Huh? Why even say that? Have I insulted you?
    572762|00000000||You-- You-- I was fakin' it! Every time!
   1074573|8e4585b4||Sandcrab
   1021842|00000000||Vapors don't look terribly inviting.
   1022597|00000000||Any longer and I'd have suffocated.
   1041891|00000000||Should avoid those clouds. Or bolt through them.
   1021840|00000000||Akh akh. Dammit, gotta hold my breath.
   1042817|00000000||Freeze to death if I don't hide somewhere.
   1024251|00000000||And I gotta find that next passage quick.
   1024253|00000000||If I can just find cover along the way, I should make it to the passage.
   1024260|00000000||Light, in a place like this? Someone must've lit it.
   1042824|00000000||With any luck, it was a certain grouchy elven Sage.
   1026259|00000000||Finally. Warm up a bit.
   1047428|00000000||Course… What else? Might've expected this.
   1047430|00000000||Just one more wave…
   1024247|00000000||Brrr… Cold.
