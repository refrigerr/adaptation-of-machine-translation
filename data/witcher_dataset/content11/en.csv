    558987|00000000||I'd even 'ave thought Cerys fit to be queen if she'd only achieved somethin' on her own.
    558994|00000000||Folk say she'd 'ave perished on Spikeroog if not for that witcher.
    558996|00000000||Might've been better for the lass that way…
    558998|00000000||I'd even 'ave thought Hjalmar worthy of the crown if he'd slain the giant himself.
    559000|00000000||Folk say the whelp would've returned from Undvik as gnawed bones if not for that witcher.
    559002|00000000||There, that - might've been more fortunate for the lad…
    558427|00000000||Look, the Craites' lackey's back!
    558428|00000000||Crach entrustin' his doin's to continentals - that's why he's damn impossible to reason with.
    555189|00000000||Least we know where to look for Ciri.
    555191|00000000||Mhm. Follow me. And stay alert.
    555186|00000000||Least we know where Ciri is.
    555187|00000000||What can we expect?
    555195|00000000||What're we gonna find there?
    555201|00000000||If the tomes are to be believed, nature's laws will cease to hold. Gravity, time, Undvik - all of it will be turned on its head.
    556036|00000000||Exaggerating for effect, right?
    556038|00000000||Not one bit.
   1076947|00000000||The Conjunction of Spheres has begun. The worlds - they're aligned, permeate one another. Avallac'h could use this - bring the Aen Elle here… or something far worse.
    554522|00000000||Where's Ciri?
    554524|00000000||What? I thought you knew.
    554526|00000000||All I know is Avallac'h might've betrayed us.
    555181|00000000||What the--? That a storm?
    555183|00000000||Geralt… Look!
   1062109|00000000||Wha… What the hell's happening?!
   1062111|00000000||I find it damned hard to believe, but…
    554268|00000000||The gate between the worlds is open.
   1076944|00000000||We must reach the tower. Quickly. Stop Avallac'h while this can still be reversed.
    555197|00000000||Magic anomalies of the third order.
    555199|00000000||Specifics, Yen. Specifics.

    558389|00000000||{Ess onderorde aep prionnsa var Attre? } [Have you served under Duke var Attre before?]
    558390|00000000||{Mhm. Aen peanasa triall aep Angra yn hwre, aep oostcòmhrag. } [Mhm. Penal expedition in Angor, and now, on the eastern front.]
    559010|00000000||{Esse erkene? } [He any good?]
    559012|00000000||{Erkene. Ess marca deich eate’n fem evalla, ro va'ess du jinearalt. } [Yes. Rode ten years in the Fifth Cavalry before they made him a general.]
    559014|00000000||{Yea. N'esse vind orde aep ardadel, que orloog va'viss aep skool. } [Good. I dislike taking orders from aristos. Most know war only from the books they read at the officers' academy.]
    558426|00000000||Cerys and Hjalmar - where are they?
    561484|00000000||What happened to Cerys and Hjalmar?
    561503|00000000||Soon as the imperial fleet was spotted on the horizon, Hjalmar rallied the longships, set sail to face it.
    561505|00000000||Cerys went with him… Neither has returned.
    558425|00000000||We move out at once.
    561481|00000000||Ye hear what the king said? Move!
    561486|00000000||Svanrige… Who could've known. The jarls have one they can believe in again.
    561488|00000000||And what brought you here? Come to make sure no scandal in Skellige passes you by?
    558394|00000000||Heard of the Sunstone?
    558165|00000000||Listen, Ermion. know anything about the Sunstone? Legends place it somewhere in Skellige.
    557579|00000000||The Mask of Uroboros first, now the Sunstone. Monsters may rest easy - you've become a treasure hunter.
    558001|00000000||I've never found the Aen Seidhe elves interesting. But there's a skald, Eyvind - he could help you. Once told me of some inaccessible caverns or ruins or somesuch…
    558005|00000000||Where will I find him?
    558007|00000000||Today? In Arinbjorn, doubtless.
    558167|00000000||You might also ask the pearl divers Erling and Matthias Fishlung. Of late they hunt near the tip of the bay, eastern end.
    558168|00000000||Fishlung?
    558170|00000000||Fishlung? Interesting.
    558252|00000000||So they call him. Submerges for hours at a time.
    558254|00000000||None know how he does it. But I've my suspicions.
    558263|00000000||Hm. Not too fond of him?
    558359|00000000||It's nothing personal. I couldn't stand his father or grandfather either.
    558040|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    558042|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    558044|00000000||One thing, Geralt. These caves or ruins - Matthias' and Erling's ancestors would've looted them bare centuries ago were they not protected by some magic barrier.
    558059|00000000||Take a sorceress with you. You must've brought at least one along.
    558065|00000000||Whole gaggle, this time.
    558067|00000000||Ugh! Gods protect us.
    534114|00000000||And truly you could do nothing? At all? For six whole months?
    538599|00000000||Why don't you tell me about the emperor. He's apparently become terribly attached to you.
    538601|00000000||Philippa…
    538603|00000000||What?
    538605|00000000||Want a cracker?
   1065677|00000000||Perhaps this was not a good idea after all…
   1070234|00000000||Did you see the Vigo woman?
   1070236|00000000||How? She is not to leave her cabin.
   1070389|00000000||Also, merely to gaze at her is to commit treason, they say.
   1070393|00000000||Mmm, is that so? I believe I would risk it.
   1070382|00000000||Ooo, nothing but splinters left of that one.
   1070242|00000000||I wonder which of the brave jarls sent that tub against the imperial fleet.
   1070244|00000000||The Skelligers are not so thick. I wager it was a merchant vessel.
    458124|f759b018||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    557209|00000000||I'd rather verify it now. Otherwise, I'll continue to wonder if he's not about to stab me in the back.
    557211|00000000||You've something of a persecution complex.
    556435|00000000||You needn't come with us.
    556437|00000000||I hadn't intended.
    553769|00000000||I'll rip their heads off!
    553771|00000000||Ciri… These people, they’ve endured a lot.
    553773|00000000||That is no excuse. Nothing can excuse this.
   1067916|00000000||The druid's gone to reason with the dimwitted knob.
    558202|00000000||Went to see Lugos. An an Craite on the throne remains a thorn in his arse, heheh. Now he's seen the Black Ones, it pricks him even harder.
   1067883|00000000||Went to see Lugos. Since Hjalmar took the throne, it's as if someone stuck a goad up the old prick's arse. Now he's seen the Black Ones, bloody believes he'll save Skellige with their aid.
   1067926|00000000||How was the coronation?
   1067934|00000000||Coronation go well?
   1067938|00000000||Hah! Why should I tell you, Wolf? You might've come. All others did.
   1067945|00000000||And when I say all, I mean all.
   1069040|00000000||Lugos appear as well?
   1067943|00000000||Yeees, a frown on his face over all three days as if he'd filled his gut with addled oysters and was too sheepish to ask the way to the privy.
   1069056|00000000||Might've guessed then he'd not relent.
   1067925|00000000||Think I'll join him.
   1067928|00000000||Think I'll join Ermion. Need to talk to him.
   1067932|00000000||Go. And when you see that bloody twit Lugos, be sure to tell him-- Argh, best not. The druid knows what to say. Farewell.
   1067897|00000000||Went to see Lugos. Since Cerys took the throne, it's as if someone stuck a goad up the old prick's arse. Now he's seen the Black Ones, bloody believes he'll save Skellige with their aid.
   1067912|00000000||Wolf, did you see? The black dogs in their rickety tubs! They bay at our gates, seek to strike fear in our hearts!
   1067914|00000000||Saw 'em all. Where's Ermion?
    563338|00000000||Feel like I've walked into somebody's bedroom.
    563339|00000000||Hm, mirror's standard. Might've expected a hidden portal.
    563343|00000000||Huh, didn't know he had a sweet tooth.
    563344|00000000||Mff. Hmm. Elves sure know their fragrances.
    533362|00000000||Loose at will!
    533363|00000000||An assassin! Let fly!
   1072906|00000000||Damn the dogs. He's hidden somewhere!
   1072904|00000000||We got him. Return to your stations.
   1063092|00000000||{Eisio! Galle vuanedd! } [Ice! Reduce speed!]
    301032|5a979acb||Wild Hunt Warrior
   1070422|00000000||When I was a boy, my parents brought me to Skellige once.
   1070424|00000000||Huh? What for? Why? There is nothing here but crags, harpies and ploughing seaweed.
   1070426|00000000||For a boy, it was a delight to sail out with fishermen. Quite the adventure.
   1070430|00000000||I remember Undvik. They showed me how to weave nets.
   1070428|00000000||Hm. Pleasant to come back after all these years.
    558391|00000000||{Ma morvudd esse trom'caith. Truinn'armach. } [The enemy will be heavily armored. Full plate.]
    558983|00000000||{Esse'va veloë aep mass. Que'ss a il'edrithean? } [Good. The faster they will sink. What about mages?]
    558393|00000000||{Esse'aer qinnte. Il'edrith foghnè ess onbekend. Esse'kraihen nhetwerk yn dwimeritium bomaeb a va. } [A certainty. Unknown form of magic. You'll receive nets and dimeritium bombs.]
    558928|00000000||{Nor gláeddyv. } [A sword will do.]
   1063114|00000000||Said you had something to tell me.
   1063116|00000000||Avallac'h has tricked us both.
   1063118|00000000||He set us against each other… and he's made off with Cirilla.
    556965|00000000||I don't believe you.
    413756|00000000||Those fucks on Faroe'll faint soon as they see the imperial sun.
    413758|00000000||Heheh. Be kickin' themselves when they wake on seein' us with most of the booty.
    534835|00000000||Be the first raid where the Black Ones deliver the goods to our doorstep.
    413760|00000000||It's like a sheep grindin' 'gainst the shears for ye.
    454261|00000000||Hm, I could use a fine Viroledan for me Madds. My blade's too heavy for the lad.
    559847|00000000||Done deal?
    559858|00000000||Nothing to be done?
    559860|00000000||It's too late.
    559848|00000000||I'd do it for free.
    559854|00000000||Do it for free, gladly.
    559856|00000000||Ehh.
    559862|00000000||The king pledges to fulfill all the conditions by the summer solstice.
    559868|00000000||Before I sign, I wish to hear this from the king's mouth.
    559887|00000000||Svanrige.
    559917|00000000||Aghh...
    559890|00000000||Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
    559910|00000000||Tuirseach!
    559912|00000000||Tuirseach!
    559850|00000000||Same price as for an erynia.
    559852|00000000||Tempting.
    559846|00000000||Same as for an erynia.
    559805|00000000||Who is this?
    559807|00000000||No one important.
    559827|00000000||As I was saying - we shall discuss the details later. His Majesty accepts the document in its current form.
    559829|00000000||Never thought I'd live to see the day…
    559841|00000000||We are prepared to seal the treaty.
    559845|00000000||How much would I need to pay you to take off her head here and now?
    528605|00000000||No way around it - gonna have to dive. They call him Fishlung for a reason.
    556706|00000000||Mhm.
    556708|00000000||Geralt… I did help Triss escape.
    556718|00000000||Once it's over, you'll go to Kovir, live happily ever after.
    556720|00000000||What I do once it's over is not your concern.
    556722|00000000||Why do the others even concern you?
    556724|00000000||You serious? If that's really your question, no way you'd understand my answer.
    555047|00000000||We need to focus on Ciri. What do you think Avallac'h wants from her?
    555049|00000000||Same as Eredin, I imagine. He will use her to open a gate between the worlds.
    556726|00000000||And thank you. For helping us.
    556728|00000000||No more. Please.
    556730|00000000||Right.
    556710|00000000||What's next for them?
    556712|00000000||Interrogation, torture… Then death, possibly. Philippa certainly.
    556714|00000000||I'm not proud of myself, Geralt. But as it is, I've risked much by saving Triss.
    556716|00000000||I understand.
    556704|00000000||Search the beach to start…?
    562434|00000000||Keep looking. It must be here.
    528556|00000000||Must be the pearl divers' boat.
    533496|00000000||Shoot him! Keep him away from the ship!
    533497|00000000||There, in the water! Shoot!
   1072896|00000000||Did we hit him?
   1072898|00000000||Where the hell has he gone?
    558397|00000000||{Innleadair korps ess'deireadh sonde. } [The engineers have finished their survey.]
    558899|00000000||{Hoog aep dei'bai esse fem heamh, an que yn a tre cairt. } [Maximum depth of the bay - five fathoms. But only over one third of its area.]
    558901|00000000||{Tanalach… } [Shallow…]
    558903|00000000||{N'esse evellien. Esse klipaen yn zandbankean am meadhan aep de'bai. Hwre, hwre... Yn hwre. } [That's not all. Rocks and sandbars in the center. Here, here… and here.]
    558905|00000000||{Anns a'ques vlaggeskipaen esse balla aep har. Òrde-zreth cruinn yn cnàmhan aespar. } [The flagships must stay close to shore. Ring formation, continuous bombardment.]
    558907|00000000||{Yeá, awr! } [Yes, sir!]
    465467|05df8c2c||Golem
    551841|00000000||I'll come back. With Ciri.
    551840|00000000||Get to work.
    551861|00000000||Get to work.
    551876|00000000||I'm fine. Now go… and give Avallac'h my heartfelt regards.
    552063|00000000||Now, Geralt!
    551868|00000000||Agored, teirgane agored!
    551864|00000000||I'll come back - with Ciri.
    551866|00000000||I know.
    551432|00000000||Damn… Avallac'h's surrounded the tower with a magic barricade.
    551433|00000000||Can you dismantle it?
    551804|00000000||Dismantle? No. I can make a tear, at best. But only for a moment, because there's no--
    551806|00000000||Specifics, Yen. Will we both get through?
    551839|00000000||No. You must go alone.
    551874|00000000||I'll be fine. Go.
   1074174|00000000||We knew in settin' out - there'd be no returnin'!
   1074176|00000000||We was to kill Black Ones!
   1074178|00000000||Now we face the wraiths of Mörhogg! We'll die glorious deaths, fightin' in the Final Battle!
   1066342|00000000||Waaaaaaagh! Outta my way, whoresons!
   1070238|00000000||I heard Gerben got the dog watch again.
   1070240|00000000||Yes. Rotting in the bilge should teach him not to mock the commander.
   1070405|00000000||True. Though you must admit de Vijver smells a bit like a wet ferret.
   1065050|00000000||Child of the Elder Blood, do you come to surrender?
   1064980|00000000||No. I come to kill you.
    539896|00000000||Look, Geralt.
   1065527|00000000||Dammit all! They'll pick us off like ducks!
   1073882|00000000||Fuckin' hell!
   1074217|00000000||Demons! The demons of Mörhogg!
    533934|00000000||Do you think the elf is to be trusted?
    533935|00000000||I don't recall you having these doubts when he was healing you.
    538567|00000000||Do you know what I just realized?
    538587|00000000||Hm?
    538589|00000000||Except for the two of us and Ciri, Geralt has slept with every woman on this ship.
    538591|00000000||Don't worry, it's only a matter of time in your case.
    562143|00000000||Found it!
    558402|00000000||{N'esse va lamh voorsnit? } [Shall we not take the irons?]
    558403|00000000||{Neen. Ker'zaer n'iarr hevangen. } [No. The emperor wants no prisoners.]
    558826|00000000||{Yn yea. Ess nor zeist, que Temerian, que'ss ess'va lamh aep Hamm. } [Good. They'd just be trouble, like those Temerians we took at Hamm.]
    560557|00000000||{Que'ss fa'dhe vae seann? } [Were they ever ransomed?]
    560559|00000000||{Neen. Ess'va nach doo. } [No. Ended in a ditch.]
    520728|00000000||Ready.
    520729|00000000||Let's go.
    538377|00000000||Let's see what Avallac'h's really planning…
   1065753|00000000||Let's look around. Should be a relatively fresh grave mound.
   1065755|00000000||Thank you for coming. I detest graveyards, especially wandering them alone.
    553779|00000000||Don't like graveyards either.
    553781|00000000||Graveyards, not my favorite either.
    553783|00000000||Why not?
    553785|00000000||Remind me of work.
    565970|00000000||Never been to a cemetery to visit someone's grave. Always hunting some ghoul or rotfiend.
    565972|00000000||Ah, frankly, I'd rather have come here with a contract, to do some witchers' work.
    553752|00000000||Think… The body… What could have become of it?
    553754|00000000||They didn't burn it. Save that honor for kings and heroes. Doubt they left him in the garden, too. Hm.
    553756|00000000||Ugh. Bastards!
    553758|00000000||What?
    553760|00000000||Beyond the village - there's a pit. They fill it with sheep taken by blackleg. Crabs pick at their bones at night.
    553654|00000000||Lasse, son of Njord… Olaf, son of Ove… Ynge, daughter of Trottnir…
    553704|00000000||Dammit. He's not here. Skjall has no grave!
    553728|00000000||Geralt, I shan't leave until I bury him.
    553778|00000000||Let's look around together. Come on.
    553776|00000000||Let's look together.
    553643|00000000||Glad you made it. I'd started to think you wouldn't find the time.
    553645|00000000||You don't mean that.
    553647|00000000||So… find the grave?
    553648|00000000||No, I can't stand graveyards. Really dislike wandering them alone.
   1068681|00000000||I shall try to get through the barrier…!
    546936|00000000||Riannon. Amavet. Fiona. Corbett the Cintrian. Muriel. Adalia. Calanthe. Pavetta…
    556408|00000000||Grab the horse! We'll save time!
    556411|00000000||Move, Geralt! I won't wait!
    556412|00000000||Use the Axii, dammit!
    556414|00000000||I've no idea why you refused to grab that horse… But fine. We'll do it your way. Let's go!
    561087|00000000||Don't you think it's time you stopped interfering in Ciri's life?
    561089|00000000||No.
    561091|00000000||But you do know we're not a pack of wolves you can just drive away from her with your sword.
    561093|00000000||Sure you are, and yes, I can. If the need arises.
    170811|72cb8ee5||Drowner
   1062832|00000000||Geralt! Stay close!
   1062830|00000000||We must stay together!
    554553|00000000||At laaaast…
    554501|00000000||Hand it over, and let's get outta here.
    554534|00000000||Not so fast. We've a matter to discuss.
    561095|00000000||Lemme guess - you gotta fly. You're about to tell me why you need the Sunstone so much more than we do. Then you'll change into an owl and - whoosh!
    561097|00000000||No idea where you got such a ridiculous notion. Ciri's safety is most important to me now.
    561099|00000000||But I wish to talk to you about the future. My future.
    529556|00000000||You may go. I know you've things to do. I shall find my own way back.
    556799|00000000||Any other words of wisdom? Or can we go?
    561104|00000000||Done? Can we go?
    561105|00000000||You want to take Yen's place beside Emhyr.
    561107|00000000||You wanna take Yen's place at Emhyr's side.
    561109|00000000||And at Ciri's.
    561111|00000000||I think you understand it's inevitable. And I would truly prefer Yennefer to be far away when it happens.
    561112|00000000||Holding her in the imperial dungeon would be costly. And it would give the wrong impression.
    556753|00000000||Triss might object.
    556756|00000000||Ah, yes. So give Yennefer some friendly advice, would you? She'll listen to you.
    556697|00000000||Once we've defeated the Hunt and Ciri is safe, Yennefer's meteoric rise at the imperial court will come to an abrupt end.
    556702|00000000||Which is wonderful from my perspective. I'm not interested in reviving the Lodge if I'm not to have the deciding vote.
    556739|00000000||You're telling me this because…?
    556740|00000000||If I know even one bit, I expect that once we've defeated the Wild Hunt, you aim to slip out the back door, with Ciri… to disappear into the wilds, correct?
    561100|00000000||All very romantic, but perhaps instead of destroying the girl's life, you could take Yennefer with you. And go.
    556693|00000000||Wouldn't worry. Emperor's got plans for you, I'm sure.
    556701|00000000||Stop playing the jester and listen to me carefully.
    556580|00000000||Emperor's got plans for you - I'm sure of it.
    556579|00000000||I recommend the alpine air of Nazair.
    556582|00000000||You'll like Nilfgaard - no two ways about it. I recommend the fresh alpine air of Nazair.
    556584|00000000||Hahah, and Yennefer claims you have no sense of humor. Now listen carefully.
   1037385|00000000||It's sure to be today. Hm, yes, what is it?
   1037387|00000000||Stop that!
    551290|00000000||Shit. An earthquake?
    551782|00000000||We must hurry.
    551771|00000000||Tremors're getting worse.
    551772|00000000||We've not much time.
    556528|00000000||{Ess'sheysse aep leith orde. } [I say plough these orders.]
    556529|00000000||{Thaess aep… Esse'iare a va y esse'croigh. } [Quiet… Before they hear us, and we hang.]
    556524|00000000||{A bloedde pest. Quess'aen? } [Shit… What is that?]
    556525|00000000||{Geasë inisan… } [Cursed isles…]
    519805|00000000||Let's go.
    563086|00000000||Someone's there. Beyond the door…
    563166|00000000||Pretty cozy. Doesn't look much like a lab at all.
    563168|00000000||That proves nothing. We must look around.
    563170|00000000||It's a bit low, isn't it? Rummaging through his papers?
    563172|00000000||You wished to come, my dear.
    563175|00000000||Portrait of Ciri, I think.
    563177|00000000||No, that's not me. Where's the scar?
    563179|00000000||It's definitely you. Hm, really captured you.
    563181|00000000||Sure Avallac'h's only interested in you for your magic abilities?
    563183|00000000||Pfff. Very funny.
    539924|00000000||It seems someone was literally just here…
    543794|00000000||Avallac'h's assistant, maybe?
    543796|00000000||No, somehow doesn't seem like Avallac'h to have one.
    543786|00000000||An assistant, maybe?
    543785|00000000||Avallac'h's on the ship. We know that.
    543788|00000000||Avallac'h's on the ship. We know that.
    543790|00000000||What if he's not…?
    543792|00000000||Stop.
    543825|00000000||Hm. A distillate? Smells like…
    543827|00000000||Verbena.
    539962|00000000||A-ha.
    543819|00000000||"A-ha" what?
    543822|00000000||No, nothing.
    543823|00000000||Sometimes you really get on my nerves, you know?
    539963|00000000||Herbs. Not very incriminating.
    539964|00000000||Wait. We've not examined the entire laboratory yet.
    166754|68667754||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    534001|00000000||Cemrae ei iache!
    534002|00000000||Rhane, toriad rhane!
    534003|00000000||Gvaethe ei arwyneb!
   1075777|00000000||Zireael! I await.
    520677|00000000||Hm. So how do we get up the--
    520678|00000000||The stairs? I'll fix them right away.
   1031396|00000000||Look what the cat dragged in. Fringilla Vigo!
   1031402|00000000||Philippa. A pleasure, as always.
   1031410|00000000||Come now, we need none of that. Fringilla, we must speak.
   1031412|00000000||Oh my.
   1031505|00000000||Fringilla!
   1031507|00000000||Triss… Where's Yennefer?
   1031508|00000000||She'll be here soon. And she's sure to want to talk to you.
   1031539|00000000||I don't doubt it.
    544117|00000000||Yen…!
    539431|00000000||Genealogical chart of the Aen Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood. From Lara Dorren…
    549911|00000000||To me. You never showed me the full version. I had no idea Videmont of Aedirn was an ancestor.
    561713|00000000||Was he the one who punished his daughters with a hot iron, or the one who had his own father's eyes gouged out?
    539470|00000000||Him of the daughters. My, even I'd never seen the full version.
    561812|00000000||Seems Avallac'h has analyzed all the paths of Lara's gene, even those we thought extinct.
    561325|00000000||Only analyzed?
    561920|00000000||He's only analyzing - really believe that? If he's anything like our mages, I seriously doubt he's standing back and observing how Lara's descendants are doing.
    561935|00000000||I don't think we'll ever know if or how deeply the elves have meddled in the gene's mutation.
    561937|00000000||Did you have a hand in… in what Geralt mentioned? The work of those human mages…
    561939|00000000||Of course not.
    566181|00000000||Forget this. Not like we're gonna learn anything new.
    566182|00000000||How can you know?
    566185|00000000||I don't wish to read this either.
    566179|00000000||Had enough of this.
    561321|00000000||Let's look at his notes.
    561818|00000000||Let's look at his notes.
    561847|00000000||Gods… he's spent over two centuries on this. He was the first to study Lara's gene. Falka… Mh, some entries about Ciri…
    561865|00000000||But it's here, later, that things get interesting. He actually tried to cultivate a genetic mix like Ciri's. But one excluding the human line.
    561880|00000000||Meaning what exactly? That I ought to be looking about for giant jars holding my siblings?
    561882|00000000||Don't be foolish! Avallac'h never got that far. Apparently, all his experiments ended in failure.
    561924|00000000||You are unique.
    561966|00000000||And that's why we've the Wild Hunt to contend with.
    540694|00000000||Let's ferret on - see if we can't find something even more interesting.
    565251|00000000||We mean no harm.
    565258|00000000||We mean you no harm.
    565262|00000000||I care not at all why you're here. Get out.
    565294|00000000||Ciri, let's go.
    565296|00000000||Ciri, let's get out of here.
    565298|00000000||No. I want to listen.
    565269|00000000||Didn't actually believe her, did you?
    565265|00000000||Ciri, you didn't actually believe her, did you? She's, uh… personally involved in the matter, that's clear.
    565267|00000000||What of it?
    565312|00000000||Go for it.
   1070643|00000000||Ha-rah!
   1070649|00000000||Ugh!
   1070654|00000000||Eeeeeeerrrgh!
   1070656|00000000||Aaa-argh!
   1073637|00000000||There. That's better. Let's get out of here.
    549267|00000000||What's that?
    549269|00000000||A necklace. Lara Dorren's.
    549272|00000000||It's beautiful, but…
    549274|00000000||Yours, to wear…
    565317|00000000||Let's go. I'm sick of this place.
    565319|00000000||Calm down. The elf was right.
    565321|00000000||Argh. Aren't you supposed to cheer me up?
    565323|00000000||You carry Lara's gene - nothing you can do about it. Inherited her talent and her power, too.
    565325|00000000||That she-elf would give up a century of her life to be you.
    565327|00000000||Certainly didn't seem so.
    565329|00000000||You were born with a great gift. And only you can decide how to use it.
    565311|00000000||Calm down.
    565304|00000000||If they despise me so, they should leave me be!
    565306|00000000||Ciri…
    565308|00000000||What?! Do you fear I'll level this place like I did Kaer Morhen?
    565310|00000000||Shame I can't do that at will, because I'd really like to now!
    565300|00000000||Avallac'h means that much to you?
    565302|00000000||What's that got do to with anything?
    565268|00000000||He that important to you?
    565271|00000000||He said you shared Lara's features - I don't see whatever it is he sees. It seems a bit like trying to drink water from a mud puddle.
    565273|00000000||But… I imagine that belief somehow helps him with his task.
    565275|00000000||What task?
    565278|00000000||Do you think he trails you everywhere for pleasure? Even I grow ill at the sight of you.
    565280|00000000||It's incredible how those like you still believe you're superior to humans - in any way.
    565282|00000000||She's no human. She's a degenerate half-breed. To have no choice but to use something like that - it's humiliating.
    565284|00000000||Another word and I'll--
    565286|00000000||What? You'll change nothing. She must do what she must. Then Avallac'h will finally be free of her.
    565290|00000000||If he hates me so deeply, why didn't he tell me to my face?
    565292|00000000||Like what?
    565293|00000000||For example?
    565332|00000000||You… I remember you. From Tir ná Lia.
    565334|00000000||Remarkable. I thought all elves looked alike to those of your race. If it's Avallac'h you seek, he's not here.
    565336|00000000||I know.
    565338|00000000||And yet you come here? What for? To spy on him? He tries his damndest to save you every time you do something stupid - is that not enough?
    565340|00000000||What can you possibly know about that?
    565342|00000000||You'd be surprised. He's told me a great deal about you.
    565253|00000000||Who are you?
    565255|00000000||Not your concern. Get out of here. Now.
    565250|00000000||Who are you?
    565249|00000000||How did you get in here?
    560064|00000000||Couldn't help notice the tension between you and Yennefer and Triss. It's very hard on Ciri, I think.
    561076|00000000||There are times I doubt you three realize how it looks.
    561078|00000000||Triss plays the big sister to Ciri, but eagerly awaits a chance to hop in bed with you. You and Yennefer play the parents--
    561080|00000000||Yeah, so if you're angling to make it a fivesome, there's clearly no room.
   1062819|00000000||Wait! Gvares, tavel!
   1062823|00000000||Keep near me!
   1062817|00000000||Dammit… It'll bury us!
    562141|00000000||The scan's echo is strongest here.
    546700|00000000||We've awoken the sentry.
    517397|00000000||I'll take care of him.
    520682|00000000||I'll get her!
   1063059|00000000||"I give you my heart?" What kind of a spell is that?
   1063061|00000000||It's an old love letter. Ancient.
   1063063|00000000||As I said, this stone was to reunite a pair of lovers.
   1063065|00000000||Never thought I'd say anything of the sort to Eredin.
   1063067|00000000||{Aen verelith cyrre naid. } [I give you my heart.]
   1063069|00000000||{Ader eich blaen eide ‘me. } [But I shall take your head.]
   1063071|00000000||The elven bauble worked.
   1063073|00000000||They approach.
   1063077|00000000||Break a sword, Geralt.
    553195|00000000||These are your people.
    553321|00000000||Never heard of Skelligers looting fallen warriors. That a tradition? I mean, these are your own people.
    553322|00000000||You not have eyes? Whaddaya mean, our own? These are Faroe scum!
    553366|00000000||Went after the Black Ones with two longships. Fishbrains!
    553393|00000000||We got nothin' else for you, so if you're done, we'd rather get back up top.
    553396|00000000||I'm done. And good idea.
    553390|00000000||But what you exactly… What was that? Ye hear it, Erling?
    553226|00000000||Listen. Heard you know a thing or two about elven ruins in Skellige.
    553271|00000000||Who says?
    553273|00000000||Ermion.
    553275|00000000||Hm. You'll not tell 'im what you saw today, will ya?
    553277|00000000||Depends.
    553279|00000000||Elven ruins, you say. What you want to know?
    553356|00000000||Druid mentioned some cavern you've never been able to enter. Where is it?
    553228|00000000||East of Kaer Trolde, in a cove you can only reach from the sea.
    553212|00000000||Heard you know something about elven ruins.
    553221|00000000||Plan to return the bodies to their families at least? I mean, once you're done?
    553222|00000000||They speak true - mutants got nothin' resemblin' refined sentiments.
    553289|00000000||Look at 'em. You think their ever-lovin' mums and wifeys wanna see 'em in this state?
    553290|00000000||The sea'll bury them.
    553300|00000000||And that's that.
    553211|00000000||Hand the bodies over to their families after?
    553213|00000000||Taking quite a risk.
    553257|00000000||Risking a lot.
    553403|00000000||Why? That a threat or somethin'?
    553405|00000000||Don't need to worry about me. But I heard calls underwater. Monsters - must've sensed blood.
    553414|00000000||Huh. I-I don't… hear nothin'.
    557014|00000000||Ordinary folk never hear these things… till it's too late.
    553409|00000000||We best get outta here, Matthias.
    553191|00000000||Run outta pearls?
    553200|00000000||Not your concern. What the sea gives, we take.
    553202|00000000||Seems she's a reluctant giver.
    553203|00000000||Aye, I could use a better knife. But a few hours and their fingers are swollen.
    553194|00000000||No more pearls?
    553182|00000000||Look, Erling. Told you we wasn't done for the day. Didn't even have to fish this one out.
    553184|00000000||You daft? Can't you see he's a witcher?
    553219|00000000||What's a witcher doin' here?
    568598|00000000||Who's next? Who wants to taste Skellige steel?!
    568599|00000000||Hjalmar! You seen Ciri?!
    568600|00000000||By the Naglfar!
    568602|00000000||We'll drown all you bastards! Till the bay's black with your corpses!
    458483|00000000||Wraiths.
    170734|00017dcc||Boy
   1076961|00000000||Mhm… More on the way.
   1076963|00000000||We must hurry, Geralt. The gates between the worlds are growing wider.
    556472|00000000||"And giants shall face giants in battle…" Just like the ballads.
    556473|00000000||This is not Ragh nar Roog… Not yet. The Conjunction is just beginning.
   1076958|00000000||What'll happen next?
   1076960|00000000||I don't know, Geralt. I'd rather not find out.
    562764|00000000||Greetings, White Wolf!
    556375|00000000||{Verloos? } [Losses?]
    556376|00000000||{Tve tuveë, yn sehr ràno. Als esse'lamh esan… } [Two dead, one heavily wounded. If we carry him to--]
    556377|00000000||{N'ess tedd. Ver'spreiden evellienn. Que esse'iare beanna esse kraihen dri bethaalen. } [No time. Spread out. Triple pay to the one who finds the woman!]
    556373|00000000||{Aen skip esse krach! Ratreut! } [The ship's about to fall apart! We must retreat!]
    556374|00000000||{Ess orde a me! Adhart! } [I give the orders! Onward!]
    344533|00000000||Well, that settles the question of His Imperial Majesty's whereabouts.
    344535|00000000||Does he aim to conquer Skellige? But he knows… those are my friends!
    534211|00000000||He wishes to grant you the isles. With Cintra… and the rest of the empire.
    534224|00000000||There is an upside to all this.
    534226|00000000||Is that so?
    534228|00000000||The emperor will have to help us fight the Hunt. And we've just found Fringilla Vigo.
   1075807|00000000||Almost, Zireael. Almost.
   1075809|00000000||Ysgarthiad…
   1075811|00000000||Witcher…? So be it. Let us end this.
    557112|00000000||Making too much of it.
    557128|00000000||Making too much of it. Avallac'h's as secretive as any elf. What're your suspicions, exactly?
    557135|00000000||I… don't know, Geralt. I've a feeling it's important. Come with us.
    557142|00000000||Fine. Where is it?
    557151|00000000||On a small isle between Undvik and Spikeroog.
    557159|00000000||Not exactly on our way. Just found out the Sunstone's on Ard Skellig. Cavern along the coast, that we can only access from the sea.
    557161|00000000||Gonna need some real magic to get in, too.
    557162|00000000||Go find this laboratory. I will explore Ard Skellig. You can join me later.
    557164|00000000||Philippa, your eyesight - only just recovered and magically simulated. Didn't you say you'd need some time to get accustomed?
    557192|00000000||Did I?
    557194|00000000||I'd forgotten how irritating she can be. Come, Ciri.
    557197|00000000||We'll await you there.
    557114|00000000||So what? Wanna just sneak in and root around?
    557116|00000000||Exactly. Coming with?
    557111|00000000||Yes, sufficiently.
    549090|00000000||Going somewhere?
    549091|00000000||Ciri says there's a site in Skellige we must examine. Avallac'h's clearly hiding something from us.
    557091|00000000||Earlier, when we were in the Isles together, Avallac'h mentioned a laboratory.
    557700|00000000||At one point, he wished to teleport there… to retrieve something. And he refused to take me with him. It was all very strange…
    557093|00000000||Sufficiently suspicious, don't you think?
    517102|b339ce5d||Eyvind
    335378|05e21ea5||Guard
   1068720|00000000||Come.
   1081898|00000000||Ciri…
    517276|00000000||Entrance is very well protected. I believe we'll find something interesting inside…
    549089|00000000||How will you lift the barrier?
    549067|00000000||Atlan Kerk's inclusion should do the trick. Remember the spell?
    549069|00000000||I remember you teaching me. And to think I thought you an overbearing, cold shrew at the time.
    549087|00000000||Now, now. This is no time to get soppy.
    558545|00000000||And what else would Crach have?
    559046|00000000||He not content to have the mightiest fleet, take control of my isle, and seat his spawn on the throne?
    558546|00000000||Under present circumstances--
    559049|00000000||Under present circumstances Crach can go ahead and reap the shite he sowed.
    559060|00000000||Almighty Crach - well, surely he can take on the Black Ones and meself.
   1073880|00000000||Now's our chance!
    568591|00000000||Bjaaarni! You and your crew against the imperials! I'll lead mine at the wraiths!
    568589|00000000||Aaaargh! Follow me if you dare! Death to the black dogs!
    568592|00000000||Have you seen Ciri?!
    568594|00000000||Ciri?! Find the elf! Aaargh! C'mon, you bastards! The more the merrier!
    568593|00000000||She was with your elf!
    568743|00000000||You'll not cut through their plate! Too thick! Push 'em in the sea!
    555836|00000000||Ugh. Eyvind failed to light the signal fire again. Someone should go there.
    555838|00000000||Don't dare look at me! My job's to stand here and watch, not quarrel with that loon.
    555839|00000000||Your watching'll be for naught if our lads don't see the signal.
    556546|00000000||What happened to them?
    556547|00000000||The White Frost.
    552675|00000000||Dammit… That ship's about to disintegrate!
    552717|00000000||Hide in the hollow on the other side. Go!
   1069114|00000000||The emperor's ship lies at anchor near Undvik - still!
   1069916|00000000||We cannot hope to break through without Holger's longships. We had better wait…
   1069116|00000000||No! We ought to hit them now! While they don't expect it.
   1069128|00000000||We've no time to lose.
   1069130|00000000||Bjarne, Stian! Come! Assemble everyone. We sail.
    559826|00000000||Come, we should not stay here.
   1069459|00000000||Farewell.
   1069461|00000000||Take care now.
   1069627|00000000||So, you won't tell me how to find them.
   1069629|00000000||No, I won't. But I am grateful for your help. Farewell, and fortune smile upon you.
   1069350|00000000||So, not gonna tell me?
   1066180|00000000||You were kind to help.
   1066182|00000000||Don't mention it.
   1066184|00000000||As to the elven ruins, truth is…
   1066186|00000000||Yeah?
   1069343|00000000||Let it go. Leave them be. Surely you've other ways to make a living. You needn't resort to crude looting.
   1074107|00000000||Bloody hell! Which ones?! Who're we to shoot at?
   1074109|00000000||Whoever the fuck you have in your sights!
   1064768|00000000||Watch out! Behind you!
    413740|00000000||Ah sooner expect the white whale than the Black Ones' ships.
    413744|00000000||Folk say the emperor commands a fleet twice the size of ours.
    454263|00000000||And if they said he had a tail, would you believe that?
    534798|00000000||Not concerned with what grows out his arse. I only care whether in a year's time we'll all be sittin' in a fortress eatin' rats.
    553429|00000000||Your laws don't bind us.
    553433|00000000||We're not bound by them.
    553434|00000000||Aye, and you've clearly no respect for our customs, either.
   1055970|00000000||Back to the boat.
   1066205|00000000||Mhm.
   1055967|00000000||Together.
   1055972|00000000||Go back alone. Need to tend to something.
   1066227|00000000||Very well. I'll see you.
   1055968|00000000||Got something to tend to.
    553634|00000000||Well, they shouldn't spit on his name anymore.
    553636|00000000||Let's go.
    553630|00000000||We were right to come.
    553632|00000000||I was deeply troubled. You've no idea.
    553516|00000000||What would the specters be wantin' of some lass who--
    553526|00000000||I am not some lass. And anyone who so much as touches this grave will learn that the hard way.
    553568|00000000||Aye, none will disturb it. Desecratin' graves - well… it's the only thing elders punish harder than fleein' the battlefield.
    553570|00000000||And what you said… Can't know the truth of it. The gods'll judge Skjall now.
   1031284|00000000||Ugh. Skjall saved your bloody lives!
   1031286|00000000||The Wild Hunt was after me. Had Skjall not led me away then… Why, they would've reduced Lofoten to ash.
   1031288|00000000||Craven's place is in the ditch.
    553431|00000000||Lower your voice. Before we need another grave.
    553439|00000000||How can you defend him?!
    553428|00000000||Quiet down.
    553421|00000000||What're you doin'?
    553423|00000000||What you should've done long ago. We're burying Skjall.
    553425|00000000||Buryin' Craven? You defy the writ of the elders.
    553427|00000000||Begone, leave this place. You defile our laws!
   1065313|00000000||Drowners were protecting her. Damn, there's a lot…
   1057740|00000000||I hope you don't plan to muck about in this carrion, now.
   1066320|00000000||We came here for a reason.
   1057742|00000000||I say, look at this!
   1012999|00000000||You look good.
   1013000|00000000||For a captive of Emhyr - is that what you mean?
   1016824|00000000||Seems like he's shown you surprising… leniency. No interrogations, no torture. Or did you just tell him everything he wanted to know?
   1013001|00000000||If I'd told him everything, he'd hardly still need me alive, wouldn't you say?
   1013002|00000000||Anyway, we shan't speak of it. I and what concerns me have not been a concern of yours for some time now.
   1012997|00000000||Looking good.
    313072|00000000||So long.
    313076|00000000||So long.
   1012998|00000000||Who's Cantarella?
   1013004|00000000||Cantarella - who is she, really? She mentioned you knew each other.
   1013005|00000000||You ran into her? Her real name is Carthia van Canten, Assire's former collaborator. She's very… talented.
   1013006|00000000||Spied for you?
   1013007|00000000||Not just for us, probably. I doubt she wishes any harm upon me or other sorceresses, but one must be very careful what one says in her presence.
   1016576|00000000||Seemed like you'd told her quite a lot about me.
   1016579|00000000||You ought to feel flattered, then. That makes you famous on both banks of the Yaruga.
   1016626|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
    172334|06c10782||Skellige Woman
   1050539|00000000||Hold! It's the witcher!
   1050541|00000000||Emperor's orders! Stand down!
    556136|00000000||They know we're here?
    556138|00000000||Think they know we're here?
    556140|00000000||Emhyr's mages? Of course.
    556142|00000000||If the matter of Fringilla Vigo were resolved, they'd probably just send her over here in a skiff.
    556143|00000000||It's far from resolved. The emperor pledged to ensure the Lodge's safety, but…
    556209|00000000||Fringilla is a pricklier matter. She's his subject, one officially sentenced to death for treason.
    556239|00000000||You'll need to learn what Emhyr has planned for her - once we've found a way to toss you over to the imperial flagship.
    556382|00000000||I'm off.
   1065244|00000000||Good luck.
    556120|00000000||I'm off.
    561552|00000000||Skellige's preparing for war. Kaer Trolde's the only place he could be.
    561556|00000000||Know where he is?
    561558|00000000||I'll ask around the port. Crach's longships are moored there.
    551562|00000000||The Sunstone's in Skellige? How do we know that?
    551610|00000000||From legends. Elven ones. It lies where the White Fleet landed centuries ago.
    551680|00000000||Meaning anywhere on any one of the Isles. Splendid…
    551692|00000000||Ermion - I'll talk to him.
    555543|00000000||We're sure the Sunstone's in Skellige?
    555587|00000000||What I wanna know is if we'll be able to use the Sunstone.
    555589|00000000||You? No. Me? Naturally.
    561084|00000000||With a touch of help from the sorceresses.
    555591|00000000||Of whom some are below deck vomiting, while others remain unreachable.
    551556|00000000||I'm more interested in how to use it.
    551557|00000000||I love Elven legends, let's hear it.
    551554|00000000||Tell us, please. Absolutely love elven legends.
    551560|00000000||Gealbhan was a Sage of the Alder Elves. He fell in love with an Aen Seidhe elf - Dillian. Yet she spurned him.
    551564|00000000||Ahem. That was a jest on Geralt's part?
    551565|00000000||Too late. It won't hurt any of you to know this. On the day the White Fleet was to set sail, Gealbhan gave Dillian a gift - the Sunstone.
    551608|00000000||He believed Dillian's heart would soften in time.
    555433|00000000||Once her longing for him burgeoned, she was to use the Sunstone. Though worlds away, he would return for her.
    551614|00000000||Sounds promising. Let's just hope this Sunstone proves more useful to us than it did to that elf woman.
    551413|00000000||It was created so the Mountain Elves could summon the vessels of the Aen Elle. Now it merely serves as a symbol of a lost opportunity to unite the two tribes…
    551469|00000000||Truly? Can all of you be unfamiliar with the story of Gealbhan and Dillian of the White Fleet?
    556380|00000000||At the moment we don't even know what the Sunstone is.
    556117|00000000||Don't even know what the Sunstone is.
    556116|00000000||Can you teleport me onto the emperor's ship?
    534280|00000000||Can you teleport me onto Emhyr's ship?
    534282|00000000||Not a chance. It's better shielded than the emperor's alcove.
    534283|00000000||Though we could try to force our way through…
    555535|00000000||We need Fringilla in one piece.
    556130|00000000||Get on Emhyr's ship myself.
    556134|00000000||I'll get on the emperor's ship myself.
    556340|00000000||Plan to swim? With swords on your back? You'll get shot up like a sitting duck before you can say "The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes."
    556342|00000000||Don't panic. He'll find a way.
   1072912|00000000||Make your approach by night, you'll stand a better chance then. Once you're on board…
   1050495|00000000||Show His Imperial Majesty this letter. Hand it to him directly. We should remind him what he promised, and what he’ll get in return.
    556081|00000000||We must hurry and find the Sunstone. Seems we've plenty to do in Skellige after that.
    556108|00000000||Fringilla Vigo - we need her here.
    551466|00000000||You should have come with my daughter, your welcome would have been different.
    551526|00000000||Where is she?
    551539|00000000||In Zerrikania. She longed for sunlight.
    551541|00000000||I am known neither for my sense of humor nor for my patience.
    551529|00000000||Zerrikania.
    551527|00000000||Nearby.
    551531|00000000||Close.
    551533|00000000||Close, White Wolf, is what you are to decapitation.
    551543|00000000||You're insolent because you believe I cannot afford to hurt you. And you're right.
    551545|00000000||Yet that will change one day. When you are no longer indispensable but… disposable.
    551547|00000000||But enough of that. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
    551986|00000000||Fringilla… Been a while.
    532268|00000000||The other sorceresses, they're on Gynvael, near Ard Skellig. We could take a boat--
    532319|00000000||I'm sick to death of boats.
    551993|00000000||And I despise teleports. But have it your way. Let's go.
    551970|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    551972|00000000||At last, a point we agree on. Guards! Bring me Fringilla Vigo! You may remove her dimeritium shackles.
    551975|00000000||No introductions are necessary from what I've heard. Farewell.
    551959|00000000||Time for me to go.
    551960|00000000||Ready to forgive them? Truly?
    551962|00000000||Truly prepared to forgive them? Amnesty in exchange for help?
    551964|00000000||I'm prepared to abide by the agreement I made with Yennefer.
    551966|00000000||Didn't answer my question.
    551968|00000000||Nor must I.
    551940|00000000||Fringilla Vigo. Been told you promised Yennefer you 'd free her. I can see… I know you're a busy man…
   1050522|00000000||…so here's a letter. Oughta refresh your memory about the Lodge.
    551942|00000000||Hm… Even Yennefer's humblest requests seem like threats. I've always liked that about her. Very well, so be it.
    551549|00000000||What do you want?
    551467|00000000||We are at war, if you've not noticed.
    551487|00000000||I've noticed. Can see the smoke from burning huts miles away.
   1071752|00000000||Witcher. What a pleasant surprise.
   1050514|00000000||Hold.
    551464|00000000||Warm welcome. Thank you, Your Majesty.
    555010|00000000||Stay away from Ciri.
    555025|00000000||She's an adult, Geralt. You keep forgetting. She can decide for herself.
    555071|00000000||So, onward?
    554808|00000000||This deal with Emhyr - it's sorceress business. Pick someone else's brain.
    554819|00000000||So she's not told you anything? What about personal plans?
    554983|00000000||Has she mentioned anything? A possible advisory position? Beside a young, promising empress?
    554797|00000000||Deal with Emhyr is sorceress business.
    554880|00000000||You'll get to work with the emperor. Not excited?
    554882|00000000||No. I-I mean, yes, of course I am. Thus far the Lodge has oft banked on weak rulers. It's been one of our biggest mistakes.
    554908|00000000||Hm… So you're impressed Emhyr keeps his mages on a short leash.
    554950|00000000||Yennefer's wise to keep you out of politics. I'm afraid you'd not realize which way the wind was blowing if you pissed straight into it.
    554821|00000000||Not excited to work with the emperor?
    554801|00000000||Hash it out with Yennefer.
    554804|00000000||You oughta talk to Yennefer. Painfully clear there's unfinished business there.
    554859|00000000||Yennefer's always walked her own path. I'm actually touched she decided to take an interest in matters of the Lodge this time.
    554897|00000000||You don't trust her. So once the Hunt's defeated, leave, find asylum elsewhere. I hear Redania's offering.
    554906|00000000||I'd sooner stick my head in a zeugl's spiky orifice. Thanks, but I've other plans.
    554713|00000000||Yennefer must have tremendous pull with the emperor. To get him to guarantee the Lodge's safety? What's your take on it?
    554721|00000000||My take? Obviously a leading question. No "Geralt, I'm tired, let's sit and chat a bit" first?
    554723|00000000||Is foreplay that important to you?
    521646|00000000||There you are.
    521639|00000000||What now?
    541763|00000000||It appears I must do everything for you.
    542020|00000000||See the sentry who seems to be waiting for payment?
    555775|00000000||I'm fresh out of change.
    555777|00000000||Ugh. In blood, not coin. The sentry is Fiallan, of the elven legend. Do you literally read nothing?
    558387|00000000||Let's get these bastards.
    558388|00000000||With pleasure, Geralt. With pleasure.
    558386|00000000||We can start.
    559812|00000000||Need a bit longer.
    559814|00000000||Fine. But don't dawdle excessively.
    558385|00000000||Gimme a minute.
    558384|00000000||So, Geralt… Ready?
    558356|00000000||Geralt of Rivia?
    558357|00000000||Know any other Geralts?
    559160|00000000||Come with me, please. They've been expecting you.
    558379|00000000||…You will position yourselves on the cliffs, here, here and--
    559165|00000000||Thank you. I believe we know how to form a circle.
    559167|00000000||Even those of us who lack eyes for the moment.
    559169|00000000||I simply wish to avoid-- Oh, Geralt. We were waiting for you.
    559191|00000000||Simple, yet with so many complexes. Not now, Geralt.
    559193|00000000||Don't worry. Simplicity has a charm all its own.
    559175|00000000||Really? Seems to me you'd started already.
    559177|00000000||We were discussing questions of a magic nature. Nothing of great interest to you.
    559179|00000000||Right. 'Cause I'm just a simple witcher.
    559171|00000000||Really? Looks like you started without me.
    559170|00000000||How nice.
    559173|00000000||That's nice of you.
    559383|00000000||You were about to explain your plan.
    559385|00000000||It's simple… which does not mean it will be easy to execute.
    559387|00000000||I shall activate the Sunstone. If Caranthir answers the call, the Naglfar should appear in the bay shortly afterwards.
    559389|00000000||The Lodge must then prevent the ship from returning to the world of the Aen Elle, while the imperial fleet blocks its escape by sea.
    559391|00000000||The 7th Ymlats Infantry Regiment under Duke var Attre must then board it. With your help, naturally.
    559403|00000000||What about you? Where will you be?
    559405|00000000||Waiting in reserve. If something goes wrong… I shall react.
    559407|00000000||Mm. Like a general commanding troops from a hilltop. Gonna signal us by horn or use messengers?
    559409|00000000||Exquisite irony, but what did I do to deserve it? Have I given you cause to doubt my intentions?
    559393|00000000||And you? What're you gonna do?
    559392|00000000||Emperor's not stingy…
    559395|00000000||Wow… Emhyr's being generous with his resources.
    559397|00000000||He's halted his entire Skellige campaign to help us.
    559399|00000000||Not doing it just to be nice, believe me.
    559401|00000000||He's doing it for the same reason we all are.
    559411|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen - less talk, more action, please. Sisters, we must scale the cliffs.
    559413|00000000||Good luck.
    559416|00000000||Plan's missing one important element - what about Ciri?
    559420|00000000||Zireael will wait. At a safe distance from the Naglfar.
    560269|00000000||Got no right to give her orders.
    560271|00000000||Don't have the right to order her around.
    560273|00000000||Amusing. Zireael said the same thing, only at much higher volume.
    560274|00000000||I do, in fact, have this right. For only I know how to activate the Sunstone. Which I shall do on my terms - or not at all.
    560343|00000000||Zireael recognized the strength of my argument. I've no doubt you'll do the same.
    559476|00000000||Forbidding Ciri from doing things is pointless.
    559502|00000000||Telling Ciri she can't do something is counter-productive. Speaking from experience there… Ultimately, she does what she wants.
    559504|00000000||Let us hope.
    559506|00000000||Pardon me?
    559477|00000000||She didn't sound convinced.
    559508|00000000||Didn't sound convinced.
    559510|00000000||No. But I can't very well tie her up and teleport her away, can I?
    559512|00000000||Hm. Definitely advise against trying that.
   1123509|00000000||There's a lighthouse not far from here…
   1123676|00000000||Hm. There's a lighthouse not far from here, you know.
   1123679|00000000||Geralt! Are you suggesting we--?
   1123681|00000000||No… well, at least not right now. Just wanted to say…
   1123684|00000000||Wanted to say that since… since Novigrad, whenever I see the beam of a lighthouse, I feel good. Thinking of you.
   1123709|00000000||I'll be fine.
   1123758|00000000||I'll manage.
   1123760|00000000||You always say that.
   1123762|00000000||Haven't killed me yet.
   1126893|00000000||Well, except for that one time.
   1051794|00000000||Yen? Why're you here?
   1051796|00000000||To see you.
   1051798|00000000||Something happen?
   1051800|00000000||Not yet. But it might soon. We may not survive this. In fact, our chances are slim.
   1051819|00000000||Well, we are here to battle Eredin and the Wild Hunt at full strength. Could be like Sodden. Could be worse.
   1051825|00000000||Nothing could be worse than Sodden was.
   1051802|00000000||True, things could get rough.
   1051821|00000000||Yen, try not to panic. Just doesn't suit you.
   1051823|00000000||I'm not panicking. Just trying to be realistic. But that's not what I came to discuss.
   1051803|00000000||Try not to panic.
   1051801|00000000||Don't worry. It'll be all right.
   1051805|00000000||We've come a long way, and I'll be damned if we've come to fail. It'll be all right.
   1051808|00000000||I admire your optimism. Wish I shared it.
   1051811|00000000||Listen to me. Once it's over, if we survive… I wish to leave, go far away. And I'd like you to come with me.
   1051813|00000000||Where?
   1051815|00000000||Wherever. To Poviss, beyond the Dragon Mountains, Zerrikania, even. As far as possible from politics, plots and so-called high society.
   1051837|00000000||You dropping politics? That'll be the day.
   1051840|00000000||You? Dropping plots and politics for good? You're in your element in that world, it's your life.
   1051842|00000000||Time to start anew.
   1051844|00000000||I'll believe it when I see it. Even now, you're up to your neck in it.
   1051847|00000000||Yes, but only to set matters straight, to be able to withdraw having retained the upper hand.
   1051849|00000000||What then? A small, secluded hut with a flower garden to tend to?
   1051851|00000000||Why not? If that is what you dream of?
   1051853|00000000||We shall leave together, go where we please, do whatever strikes our fancy.
   1051860|00000000||So. Coming with?
   1051870|00000000||I dunno, Yen. Honestly, sounds too beautiful to be possible, even.
   1051880|00000000||You can always return - if after a month we can't stomach each other's company.
   1051882|00000000||All right. Willing to try.
   1051884|00000000||That's good enough for me.
   1051836|00000000||Sounds too beautiful.
   1051835|00000000||Course I'll go.
   1051862|00000000||I'd go anywhere with you.
   1051864|00000000||The answer I was hoping for.
   1051868|00000000||Go, Geralt, Avallac'h awaits.
   1056445|00000000||And don't get killed, witcher.
   1123764|00000000||Ah, Geralt. You're so charming when you try to be funny.
   1123766|00000000||Try? Take it back. That was a great joke.
   1123768|00000000||Mhm. Sure.
   1123771|00000000||I love you, you know.
   1123780|00000000||You trying to make me cry? Ciri'd never let me forget it. Go on, get.
   1123783|00000000||Love you too.
   1123752|00000000||Can't think about that.
   1123754|00000000||So what am I supposed to think about?
   1123756|00000000||Emhyr var Emreis. On parade. Completely naked.
   1123708|00000000||Don't think about that.
   1123702|00000000||Unbelievable. You said something romantic! You, Geralt of Rivia!
   1123686|00000000||Moment of weakness.
   1123707|00000000||Well, none of those during the battle, please. If anything should happen to you…
   1123688|00000000||All this snow… it makes me think of Kovir.
   1123690|00000000||And what do you think about?
   1123692|00000000||That it's like this all year there. Dark and cold.
   1123694|00000000||And you know what? It won't bother me one bit.
   1123696|00000000||It won't?
   1123698|00000000||No. Because the days, yeah, days might be short, but the nights? Nights'll be long.
   1123700|00000000||I can't wait.
   1123674|00000000||Can't wait till we leave for Kovir.
   1123499|00000000||Triss? Everything all right?
   1123501|00000000||Yes. I just wanted a moment to talk to you. Before… before it begins.
   1123503|00000000||Chin up. The Hunt's weakened. We've got--
   1123505|00000000||No. No more about the battle.
   1123508|00000000||Just hold me. And say something nice.
   1056437|00000000||No time to lose. Sooner we get this done, the better.
   1056439|00000000||Follow me.
   1056434|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
   1056441|00000000||Could probably use a few potions. Go. Join you soon.
   1056443|00000000||Just don't delay too long.
   1056435|00000000||Join you later.
   1056433|00000000||Unless you wish to come with me now?
    559514|00000000||Time is short. If you wish to do something, brew your substances or whatnot… Do it now.
    559516|00000000||You won't get the chance later. I shall await you by the boats, amongst the soldiers.
    559518|00000000||Never mind.
    559496|00000000||Gets that from her father.
    559498|00000000||I beg to differ… Emhyr is a pragmatist, Ciri an idealist.
    559500|00000000||An idealist? What're you talking about?
    559468|00000000||Got her personality from her father.
    560395|00000000||Zireael, do you swear to stay on shore?
    560397|00000000||Do I have a choice?
    560400|00000000||Where are you going?
    560403|00000000||For a walk. Or is that not allowed either? Because I could break my leg…
    560410|00000000||Oh, yes… the Elder Blood can be fiery.
    560338|00000000||Huh. I thought I could at least count on you to treat me seriously.
    560340|00000000||Never treat you any other way. You know that.
    560393|00000000||You can't defeat Eredin, don’t stand a chance. Dammit, I don't know if I can. So stay away from him, far away.
    560345|00000000||Well, can't say you're wrong there.
    560268|00000000||Can't say you're wrong.
    560263|00000000||Wild guess - not what you had in mind…
    560265|00000000||No. I wanted to go with you - that was my idea.
    560267|00000000||But I won't allow it. Far too great a risk.
    559421|00000000||Guessing this wasn't Ciri's idea…
    559422|00000000||Wise.
    560347|00000000||Makes sense.
    414295|00000000||Wait, there's something here. Feel it?
    414297|00000000||No. My medallion--
    562076|00000000||A ridiculous bauble. Don't make me laugh.
    562138|00000000||Tuning into elven magic is just slightly more difficult than sniffing out a malodorous fiend.
    562140|00000000||Watch this. Arha'an lumar!
    562134|00000000||Uh-huh.
    562136|00000000||That means the Sunstone is here. Don't stand there looking stupid. Try to shift the mirrors.
    549864|00000000||Think I'll spare you?
    549866|00000000||Think I'm willing to spare you?
    549868|00000000||I think you will not attack one unarmed.
    549870|00000000||Wouldn't be so sure. I'm in a foul mood.
    549884|00000000||Didn't think to warn me?
    549886|00000000||Didn't think it worthwhile to tell me, warn me of your plans?
    549888|00000000||I'm sorry. I know, I should have… but I feared you'd not understand.
    549890|00000000||Ahhh… Feels like I'm talking to Yennefer.
    549892|00000000||Leave with me. Please.
    549894|00000000||I will, Geralt, once I emerge from the tower. If I emerge.
   1077808|00000000||Avallac'h's put nonsense in your head.
   1077828|00000000||Avallac'h's muddled your mind with a fortuneteller's fables.
   1077830|00000000||You're wrong. The White Frost truly does approach. Worlds will freeze, one after another, and all life will be eradicated.
   1077832|00000000||Avallac'h gave me a choice. I made the decision. I must stop it.
   1077806|00000000||You don't have to make this sacrifice.
   1077816|00000000||You don't have to make this sacrifice.
   1077818|00000000||You're wrong. The White Frost is inevitable, it will come to freeze the worlds one after the other, eradicating all life.
   1077820|00000000||Only I can stop the destruction. I've given it much thought and made my decision.
   1077805|00000000||There's no annihilation coming.
   1077810|00000000||Ithlinne's Prophecy is drivel. Destruction is not our fate.
   1077812|00000000||You have seen the future, don't you remember? Entropy cannot be stopped. The worlds will freeze, one after the other, and all life will perish.
   1077814|00000000||Avallac'h is right. If I do nothing, humans, elves, all will face destruction.
    549907|00000000||Ciri… I forbid it.
    549922|00000000||Ciri, I forbid you.
    549924|00000000||You know me. Nothing I like more than breaking rules.
    549926|00000000||This? You're breaking more than a rule.
    549928|00000000||I'm sorry.
    549908|00000000||Don't do this to me. Please.
    549930|00000000||Don't do this… to me. Please. Not now.
    549932|00000000||Geralt, believe me… A tavern, mulled wine, our boots drying by the fire - I'd like nothing better.
    549933|00000000||But I can't. I must try. For you, Yen, Triss… for everyone.
    549969|00000000||Keep your fingers crossed.
    549909|00000000||Good luck.
    549935|00000000||Good luck, Ciri.
    549937|00000000||Perhaps I should have told you. I see now you might have understood.
    549939|00000000||Know you better than you think.
    549941|00000000||Don't keep me waiting.
   1062870|00000000||[Say nothing.]
   1077834|00000000||There's gotta be another way…
   1077836|00000000||What can you know about saving the world, silly? You're but a witcher.
   1077841|00000000||This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it.
   1077822|00000000||I couldn't care less about the White Frost. Let's just leave, go.
   1077824|00000000||No, Geralt. I've seen what is to come, I know destruction approaches. The worlds will freeze, one after the other, and all life will be eradicated.
   1077826|00000000||Only I can prevent this from happening.
   1077807|00000000||I don't care. Let's go.
    549896|00000000||Why the hell would you do this? The Wild Hunt's been defeated.
    549898|00000000||The White Frost has not.
    549900|00000000||The prophecies are true. I have seen worlds bound in ice. I know what awaits you.
    549902|00000000||Only the Elder Blood can stop the White Frost. Only I can stop it.
    549883|00000000||Why would you do that?
    549876|00000000||I am not your foe. I am merely helping Cirilla.
    549878|00000000||I don't believe you. Can't. Not after all that's happened.
    549880|00000000||Will you believe me?
    549882|00000000||Avallac'h speaks the truth. I asked him to help me open the tower - because I aim to enter it.
    549872|00000000||Think I'm gonna fall for that? No chance, you're wrong.
    549874|00000000||Trusted you once. Won't make that mistake again.
    549863|00000000||Not falling for that.
    549835|00000000||Geralt… So unfortunate. I'd hoped you wouldn't have to witness this.
    549837|00000000||Where's Ciri?
    549839|00000000||Nearby. Listen…
    549840|00000000||Shut up.
    549861|00000000||I've heard enough of your bullshit. Draw your weapon, let's get this over with.
    563092|00000000||Hm, it's open now.
   1063099|00000000||Any last words?
   1063101|00000000||Shut your trap… and fight!
   1063103|00000000||You had your chance.
   1063105|00000000||Witcher. I was hoping you'd come.
   1063107|00000000||Because?
   1063109|00000000||I've something to tell you. But I'll do so afterwards.
   1063111|00000000||As you expire.
    533366|00000000||Sink the boat! Shoot!
    560184|00000000||Wait! Parley! I'm a--! Dammit!
   1074904|00000000||Shit!
   1074912|00000000||Geralt… Not now, please.
   1074908|00000000||Looks like you're making progress…
   1074910|00000000||Mhm… Slow… but gradually forward…
    559249|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    559251|00000000||One thing, Geralt. These caves or ruins - Matthias' and Erling's ancestors would've looted them bare centuries ago were they not protected by some magic barrier.
    559253|00000000||Take a sorceress with you. You must've brought at least one along.
    559255|00000000||Whole gaggle, this time.
    559257|00000000||Ugh! Gods protect us.
    559237|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    559236|00000000||Fishlung?
    559239|00000000||Fishlung? Interesting.
    559241|00000000||So they call him. Submerges for hours at a time.
    559243|00000000||None know how he does it. But I've my suspicions.
    559245|00000000||Hm. Not too fond of him?
    559247|00000000||It's nothing personal. I couldn't stand his father or grandfather either.
    559221|00000000||Listen, Ermion. Know anything about the Sunstone? Legends place it somewhere in Skellige.
    559223|00000000||The Mask of Uroboros first, now the Sunstone. Monsters may rest easy - you've become a treasure hunter.
    559229|00000000||I've never found the Aen Seidhe elves interesting. But there's a skald, Eyvind - he could help you. Once told me of some inaccessible caverns or ruins or somesuch…
    559231|00000000||Where will I find him?
    559233|00000000||Today? In Arinbjorn, doubtless.
    559235|00000000||You might also ask the pearl divers Erling and Matthias Fishlung. Of late they hunt near the tip of the bay, eastern end.
    559208|00000000||Ever heard of the Sunstone?
    559340|00000000||Hjalmar handling things all right?
    559371|00000000||Lad's developed quite a taste for heroic adventures. Left ruling the Isles to his father.
    559372|00000000||Quite fortunate, in fact, as now, on the eve of war, we need a more experienced leader.
    559375|00000000||And Cerys?
    559377|00000000||I would say she's being more useful than Hjalmar.
    559310|00000000||How's Hjalmar?
    559209|00000000||How's Cerys?
    559217|00000000||How's Cerys handling things?
    559332|00000000||Has the makings of an excellent queen, if she would only flee her father's shadow.
    559334|00000000||Everyone, Lugos excepted, declared their support for her. Yet the minute the imperial fleet appeared on the horizon, the jarl took matters into his own hands.
    559342|00000000||And Hjalmar?
    559354|00000000||The lad's led three raids against the imperial fleet. All against Crach's will, all failed. Yet he'll find volunteers for another.
    559356|00000000||Yeah, sounds like Hjalmar.
   1066633|00000000||Well, Geralt, I see no row can occur in Skellige without your participation.
   1066635|00000000||Mean and inaccurate, Ermion. Seems to me I've missed quite a few.
   1070684|00000000||The blood of Crach's blood sits upon the throne, and that is your doing. I'm afraid you've ignited a small civil war.
    559275|00000000||So, Clan Drummond will attack sooner then we expected, it seems.
    559277|00000000||Thought Crach sent you to negotiate an agreement with Lugos.
    559279|00000000||Hah! An agreement! Only Crach believes such a thing possible at this stage.
    559302|00000000||Mean I didn't actually ruin things for you?
    559304|00000000||Not this time. Lugos' death stands to change a great deal. His cousin, who will now be named jarl, is a weak commander, stupid. This war will start soon, end even sooner.
    559219|00000000||But why have you returned to Skellige?
    556499|00000000||{Esse'tilleadh, theervil esse'caen. } [We should turn back while we can.]
    556500|00000000||{Dat esse'croigh a va voot breuk aen orde? Ess ae’iarr--} [To be hanged for disobeying orders? I would rather--]
    556501|00000000||{Gar'ean! Havfrue! } [Watch out! Sirens!]
    556513|00000000||{N'esse mar a tha. A'ess ver'spreiden aep evellien Inis. Caen Skellig'ea esse'dekk hwre. } [Not good. We are dispersed over the isle… There could still be Skelligers lurking.]
    556514|00000000||{Ker'zaer esse'vyos que getan. } [The emperor knows what he's doing.]
    553661|00000000||Eyvind!
    553684|00000000||Eyvind!
    553687|00000000||What?
    553689|00000000||I… ugh, just wanted to assure you I only wanna look around the cavern. It's research.
    553702|00000000||Gathering material for an adventure novel.
    553735|00000000||Writing an adventure novel. Gathering material for it.
    553737|00000000||Mean to write up the comin' of the White Fleet? Prime idea.
    553745|00000000||Mayhaps you could use my translation of the Song of Gealbhan and Dillian?
    553739|00000000||Gladly, gladly. So, where's this cavern?
    553698|00000000||Gotta sail east from Kaer Trolde. Cavern's in a cove, only accessible from the sea.
    553708|00000000||So long. And… good luck with the white whale.
    553710|00000000||It'll show today. I'm sure of it.
    553718|00000000||Writing a historical treatise on the Aen Seidhe elves. Under Ermion's tutelage.
    553720|00000000||Ermion? Man never cared a whit about the Elves of the Mountains.
    553722|00000000||I've seen through you, you conniver! Cut me to bits if you like, I'll never tell you about the cavern.
    553764|00000000||Ugh…
    553701|00000000||For a treatise on the Aen Seidhe. Under Ermion's tutelage.
    553700|00000000||Research?
    553693|00000000||Hah! Can tell by your mug I was right! And to think, didn't take you for a looter at first…
    553695|00000000||I just wanna look around the cavern. Research.
    553662|00000000||[Say nothing.]
    553617|00000000||Let's watch for Gevorg together. And you can tell me what you know about any elven ruins in Skellige.
    553640|00000000||Heard of some cavern no one's been able to enter?
    553638|00000000||Good thing, too. Elsewise they'd 'ave plundered it long ago, like all the others.
    553527|00000000||I'll watch for Gevorg with you.
    553523|00000000||What's this whale?
    553462|00000000||What's this whale about?
    553592|00000000||He's to appear when specters descend from the heavens into the waves, the serpent wakes the sea's wroth, and an icy monster devours an isle.
    553593|00000000||Be the first bard to compose a ballad about him.
    553598|00000000||Legends don't happen to mention a Curse of the Black Sun, do they?
    553600|00000000||Black sun? What're you on about?
    553610|00000000||Never mind.
    553456|00000000||Not now!
    553553|00000000||Watching for Nilfgaard's fleet?
    553555|00000000||Fleet? Oh, aye, they mentioned something… Nay, I've more important matters on my mind.
    553590|00000000||By my calculations, today's the day Gevorg, the legendary white whale, will swim the waters of Skellige.
    553566|00000000||Been waitin' for this my whole life.
    553461|00000000||Forgetting anything?
    553469|00000000||Eh? Oh, yes! The pyre. All that chattin'…
    553471|00000000||I'll be… Tinder's soaked. So what'm I to use to--?
    553472|00000000||Lemme help.
    553458|00000000||You forgot to light the signal fire.
    553457|00000000||So long.
   1065605|00000000||Let's do this.
   1065607|00000000||Come back soon, all right?
   1067788|00000000||Mhm. See you.
   1067732|00000000||Let's go, Ciri.
   1065609|00000000||You can take that alone, Ciri. Meet you on Hindarsfjall.
   1065611|00000000||As you wish. I'll be at the graveyard.
   1065613|00000000||Please get it done quickly. And Ciri, try not to get into any trouble, all right?
   1067785|00000000||Certainly don't plan to. See you.
   1067753|00000000||Meet you there.
    565138|00000000||I'll go with you.
    565463|00000000||Thank you.
   1067735|00000000||Could you open a portal - to Hindarsfjall?
    565465|00000000||I can.
    565136|00000000||Yeah. I'll go with you.
    565384|00000000||Yes. There are always more important things.
    565390|00000000||I'll talk to her. You're liable to spill.
    565380|00000000||Ciri, no time for that.
    565382|00000000||You can go later. We've more important things to do now.
    565137|00000000||No time.
    565487|00000000||Must we return to the boat right away?
    565611|00000000||Something else you wanna see?
    565612|00000000||Not here. On Hindarsfjall. In Lofoten. I met a young man, Skjall, and I'd like…
    565631|00000000||What is it?
    565651|00000000||Ciri, Skjall is dead.
    565653|00000000||The Wild Hunt… Everyone…? No one survived?
    565659|00000000||Skjall died later.
    565676|00000000||You sure it was him? You'd met him?
    565716|00000000||I was there. I saw his body.
    565719|00000000||Will you visit his grave with me? I'd like to… to say goodbye.
    517302|00000000||So? Any incriminating letters? Closets full of skeletons?
    517303|00000000||We've not even opened the door yet.
    517305|00000000||It's a highly complex magic barrier. Let's try…
    517311|00000000||Geata'ar ligen!
   1055110|231374e3||Skelliger
    556520|00000000||{Aen iarean nyald aep kroofeir… } [Like searching for a needle in a haystack…]
    519932|00000000||Hear that?
    519933|00000000||Mhm.
    534052|00000000||Out of my way, old man… And I shall spare your life.
    534726|00000000||I dare you to take it instead.
    534728|00000000||Hahahaha… As you will.
    534778|00000000||Aaaaach!
    534051|00000000||Any last words?
    534721|00000000||Haven't killed me yet.
    534723|00000000||No. I'm enjoying this. You are my toy.
    534050|00000000||Pathetic… simply pathetic.
    534772|00000000||Stop playing the warrior… Fight!
    534774|00000000||You would die an honorable death, is that it? You will be disappointed.
    534776|00000000||Aaaargh!
    566083|00000000||Perhaps you should talk to him after all.
    566085|00000000||What would be the point? Surely none now.
    566087|00000000||And later? Don't count your father out just because he's the world's richest and most powerful--
    566089|00000000||…authoritarian rotter unworthy of even one inch of trust?
    566091|00000000||Actually, of all people, I believe you can trust him, perhaps you even should.
    566093|00000000||What about the dictatorial rotter part?
    566095|00000000||Something to get used to.
    548880|00000000||Heh. Thanks a lot.
    533642|00000000||I thought you'd wish to see Crach.
    533645|00000000||It's just that… What if I disappear again tomorrow? For good this time, like my mother did?
    534678|00000000||I feel like… I shouldn't see anyone who… who is fond of me. At least not until we defeat the Wild Hunt.
    534679|00000000||We can always drop you back on the Isle of Mists.
    534066|00000000||We looked around your laboratory.
    534067|00000000||I never doubted you would. But why did you? You might've just asked me.
    544423|00000000||To hear you reveal all about your experiments with the Elder Blood gene? Unlikely.
    544425|00000000||I've hidden nothing that could be useful in our struggle against Eredin.
    544426|00000000||As regards the Elder Blood… you're all aware Ciri is exceptional. I am alone only in knowing to what extent.
    544440|00000000||Or maybe you're just obsessed with her?
    544442|00000000||I'm obsessed?
    559125|00000000||Wanna be king by the grace of Nilfgaard?
    559129|00000000||Would you be king by Nilfgaard's grace?
    559142|00000000||That your bark before you bite?
    559149|00000000||Did Crach send you here for my head? Well then, go ahead, try to take it!
    561116|00000000||Get 'em!
    559127|00000000||What would you call it, if not treason?
    559124|00000000||What is it if not treason?
    558553|00000000||I'll not kneel before an an Craite! Never! That clear to you?!
    558554|00000000||You prefer to aid the Black Ones?
    559089|00000000||I'd sooner aid the wraiths of bleedin' Mörhogg than let Crach rule all Skellige!
    558555|00000000||And your men, what do they say? Will they follow you when the jarls call you a traitor?
    559120|00000000||This here's my land, druid! Watch your words!
    558886|00000000||Birna Bran arranged everythin' behind our backs! Why, she's not even denyin' it!
    558872|00000000||What's going on in there?
    558868|00000000||Something going on in there?
    558870|00000000||That slag's sellin' us to the Black Ones! Wanna watch? Go on in!
    558888|00000000||Grrr… I refuse to look upon this disgrace!
    558891|00000000||And Svanrige? He is king, after all.
    558893|00000000||As good a king as a fish's arse is a whistle!
    558878|00000000||Looking for Ermion.
    558880|00000000||Oh, he's in there with 'em, pale as a beached carp. If he don't bring the brat in line, who will?
    558882|00000000||But no, he says, the gods gave us a king, we must support 'im! Support what? Svanrige standin' there like a mute fencin' dummy, gazin' on as that hag sells us to the Black Ones?
    558871|00000000||Looking for Ermion.
    558874|00000000||Bran would slit that traitorous bitch's throat were he alive!
    558876|00000000||And we should've drowned that whelp in deep water the day he was born!
   1070432|00000000||Mashed potatoes with thick gravy. Or some hard cheese from Gemmera.
   1070452|00000000||Beef stew- that's what I would have. My mother adds roasted onion, you see. The crunchy kind.
   1070454|00000000||Argh… How long can one eat fish and ship's biscuits?
   1063162|00000000||Silence. It's completely still.
   1063164|00000000||It's a trap. We must flee. Now!
   1063166|00000000||Not this time.
   1063168|00000000||No, Zireael. You are not ready. You do not control your powers.
   1063170|00000000||I'll manage. Get out of my way.
   1063172|00000000||Ciri.
   1063174|00000000||Ciri!
   1063176|00000000||The ice… it's a spell. You must find the mage who cast it, destroy his staff.
   1063178|00000000||I'll not stop with his staff.
   1063094|00000000||Follow me. The Naglfar must be nearby.
    557050|00000000||Arhaaam shinaaaz!
    557045|00000000||What'd she just say?
    557046|00000000||You're not her type.
   1069328|00000000||Be easier to sneak on board after dark.
   1031236|00000000||What now? Gonna grow yourself some new eyes, like Vilgefortz did?
   1056344|00000000||I remember the moment I killed him - cultivation wasn't complete, they hadn't grown in fully yet. Looked… disgusting, but…
   1031237|00000000||I take it your mention of that deviant is purely coincidental?
   1056346|00000000||Course.
   1056348|00000000||Also heard of this rich, blind dwarf from Mahakam…
   1056350|00000000||…had them put two sizable rubies in his eye sockets.
   1056352|00000000||Couldn't see a damned thing, but word is it looked pretty tasteful.
