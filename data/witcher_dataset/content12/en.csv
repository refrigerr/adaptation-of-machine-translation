    581146|00000000||Aaaaaa!
    581147|00000000||Mercy!
   1061012|00000000||Unbind me! Quick!
    581145|00000000||Help!
    581222|00000000||Thank you…
    584339|00000000||Wounds need a look?
    581225|00000000||I'll manage now.
    584342|00000000||Hunters could come back…
    584344|00000000||I'll not wait round for them.
    584346|00000000||Good luck.
    584348|00000000||I could use it.
    584658|00000000||Retreat? We have not lost the war.
    584660|00000000||Quiet.
    584662|00000000||The whole North we had on a platter. What happened?
    584712|00000000||Silence, or they will throw the book at you for sedition.
    580688|00000000||The Redanians will be here shortly.
    577580|00000000||The decision must be taken now. If the emperor refuses, someone else must do it.
    577582|00000000||How dare you?!
    577589|00000000||His Majesty would have been a cold corpse if my men hadn't stopped the assassin last night.
    577591|00000000||And you believe that gives you the right to be arrogant?
    577593|00000000||What I believe is that another attempt is imminent, and I can't be sure we'll be able to stop it.
    577597|00000000||What of Novigrad's hierarch?
    577599|00000000||What of him?
    577613|00000000||Will he get his well-earned rest or be sent straight to Darn Ruach?
    577615|00000000||At his age, the journey would be ill advised. And costly.
    577617|00000000||Mhm.
   1068673|00000000||All right. Let's go.
    578175|00000000||Who taught you that?
    553330|00000000||Vesemir. A long time ago.
    562382|00000000||How long?
    553331|00000000||Very. Back when I wanted to call myself Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarcie.
    572394|00000000||What? Hahahah.
    578177|00000000||Tell you about it tonight.
   1068675|00000000||And about the time you broke your leg, after wagering you'd jump off the roof of Kaer Morhen and land a horse's back?
   1068677|00000000||Hm, how do you even know about that?
   1068679|00000000||Eskel told me. But I want to hear you tell it. I'm certain you have a rational explanation.
    584083|00000000||Fresh trail… Medallion's vibrating. Maybe I should try…
    172329|52a3f146||Peasant
    577437|00000000||She's sufferin'…
    577438|00000000||An ol' she-wolf…
    578820|00000000||Still fightin'.
    578821|00000000||Knows she's dyin'.
   1030982|d9a6387b||Temerian Soldier
   1051892|00000000||Footprints. A dwarf's…
    579138|00000000||Someone's waiting for me.
    579129|00000000||Someone's waiting for me.
    579130|00000000||Triss Merigold? Fear not - I do not intend to have her pursued.
    579126|00000000||Yennefer needs me. I can't abandon her.
    579127|00000000||I understand.
    579897|00000000||None of your business.
    579901|00000000||That's none of your business. Not anymore.
    580118|00000000||Hmmm.
    579142|00000000||You weren't a good father…
    579144|00000000||You weren't a good father. Ciri saw you as a threat.
    580462|00000000||Even if she'd asked me to tell you something, I doubt you'd have liked to hear those words.
    579145|00000000||Understood.
    579143|00000000||Didn't talk about you.
    579148|00000000||We didn't talk about you.
    580471|00000000||I see.
    579135|00000000||If there's nothing else…
    577341|00000000||There is. But you may go.
    579136|00000000||Witcher. I do not wish to see you. Ever again.
    579146|00000000||She regretted not getting a chance to say goodbye.
    579147|00000000||Did she tell you this, really?
    580421|00000000||Didn't have to. She wanted to make peace, I know that.
    579141|00000000||Regretted not being able to say goodbye.
    579140|00000000||Did Cirilla say… Did she ask you to convey anything?
    579123|00000000||Plenty of work for witchers after a war. I'll travel east, maybe north…
    579137|00000000||Got post-war work to do.
    576114|00000000||Where is the body?
    576122|00000000||I doubt it'll ever be found.
    577275|00000000||Who else knows?
    577277|00000000||Avallac'h, elven Sage… But I doubt you'll find him, either.
    579115|00000000||And Yennefer?
    576167|00000000||She's decided to stay in the North. Provided you don't object.
    579116|00000000||I don't. And you?
    573735|00000000||Speak.
    575807|00000000||Ciri is dead.
    575833|00000000||How did it happen?
    576006|00000000||The White Cold… You're familiar with the prophecy? Ciri tried to stop it. She did, but paid the ultimate price.
   1058925|00000000||Enough.
    582651|00000000||Dwarves are hiding in the bushes.
    582644|00000000||The dwarves - out with it.
    583360|00000000||Dwarves?
    583362|00000000||I don't have time for your games. The Commandant will have his stolen chalice back.
    583364|00000000||The thieves - where are they? Tell me, or I'll...
    582653|00000000||No dwarves here.
    582638|00000000||No dwarves here.
    582645|00000000||Where are the dwarves?
    583424|00000000||Dwarves?
    583425|00000000||Do not play games with me, witcher. They are thieves, they stole Lord Dagborg's golden chalice.
    583437|00000000||Dagborg? Who's that?
    583438|00000000||The new governor of these lands.
    583442|00000000||The chalice must be found. Tell us what you know, or you will force us to extract it.
    582654|00000000||I knew it! Eternal Fire reward you. Get them!
    583472|00000000||I can't believe it! Bloody whoreson witcher!
    582656|00000000||Thanks, witcher. Get them!
    582655|00000000||Thank you, witcher. Get them!
    582641|00000000||Dwarves are in the bushes.
    583340|00000000||That a threat?
    583336|00000000||You threatening me?
    583366|00000000||The witcher will not cooperate. Take him.
    583358|00000000||You threatening me?
    583445|00000000||I see you'll not respond to courtesy.
    583447|00000000||Grab him!
    583348|00000000||Don't like your tone, mutant. Will you force me to teach you respect for those who serve the Eternal Fire?
    583350|00000000||Give it a shot.
    583439|00000000||You threatening me?
    582642|00000000||No dwarves here.
    582661|00000000||Will you insist this is your camp? Five cups, five saddles? All yours?
    583410|00000000||Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. Abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
    583413|00000000||Why do you follow them?
    583415|00000000||They stole from me.
    583417|00000000||Clever little bastards to steal from a witcher…
    583419|00000000||We must go. Should you catch them… well, never mind. We march tomorrow.
    582662|00000000||You mean to tell me this is your camp? Five tankards, five saddles - all yours?
    583450|00000000||Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. Abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
    583452|00000000||Why do you trail them?
    583454|00000000||Stole from me, too.
    583456|00000000||Stole from a witcher… cunning midgets.
    583458|00000000||We'll move on. Catch them yet.
    583421|00000000||Mean to say this is your camp? Five tankards, five saddles - all yours?
    582660|00000000||Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. They abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
    583344|00000000||Hm…
    583346|00000000||Could be they heard about Reverend Michelis' ire.
    583407|00000000||Let's go. And you, mutant - better not get in our way.
    582640|00000000||No dwarves here.
    582639|00000000||Dwarves are in the bushes.
    582637|00000000||Dwarves are in the bushes.
    583321|00000000||Reverend Michelis? Who's that?
    583323|00000000||Who's this Reverend Michelis?
    583325|00000000||A traveling preacher, a saintly man anointed by the hierarch himself. He's purged thousands of souls already.
    583327|00000000||By, uh, "purging" you mean the cleansing fire of the stake?
    583329|00000000||Mheh. You know of another way?
    582643|00000000||The dwarves - where are they?
    583297|00000000||Dwarves?
    583299|00000000||Don't feign ignorance. We've been after them since yesterday, after they stole the Reverend Michelis' golden chalice.
    583300|00000000||Anyone aiding criminals will be subject to punishment by the Holy Tribunal of the Eternal Fire.
    170734|00017dcc||Boy
   1061202|7baad1c6||Temerian Soldier
    583647|00000000||A witcher's silver sword…
    583648|00000000||Like it?
    583649|00000000||It's beautiful. May I?
    583650|00000000||Not here. You'll have ample opportunity soon enough, witcher.
    583651|00000000||What's this inscription?
    583652|00000000||An old witchers' motto. Had a sword like this once myself. But this one's better… much better.
   1077577|00000000||Let's try it out, then.
    583641|00000000||A witcher's sword… Swallow.
    583642|00000000||Oooooo.
    583643|00000000||Beautiful. May I?
    583644|00000000||Not here. You'll have ample opportunity soon enough, witcher.
    575132|00000000||Is it done?
    575133|00000000||Yes.
    576809|00000000||Did he believe you?
    576811|00000000||I have no idea.
    576799|00000000||For the cockatrice. And we've a new contract. It won't pay much, but I think it worth the toil.
    576801|00000000||You've been busy.
    583639|00000000||It's yours.
    579151|00000000||Triss awaits in Ellander.
    579152|00000000||We can meet her in two days if we hurry.
    579149|00000000||Yen awaits in Ellander.
    579150|00000000||We can meet her in two days if we hurry.
   1077618|00000000||The Path awaits. Come on.
    579054|00000000||Slandering servants of the Eternal Fire and his majesty, was he?
    579055|00000000||And how!
    574781|00000000||My brother-in-law's hidin' Nilfgaardian spies.
    582006|00000000||Hmmm…
    582008|00000000||Just don't tell my sister I told you, right?
    582010|00000000||Sister's clearly involved. We'll take her in, too.
    582015|00000000||We'll need to confirm your allegation.
    582025|00000000||Aye, yep, aye.
    582027|00000000||We know which house it is. You may go.
    582029|00000000||Hm, see I heard 'em make mention… that there's some award for information… some coin…
    582031|00000000||You heard wrong. The mention was of new taxes.
    574783|00000000||I know what I saw. She spent the whole winter cavorting with them Nilfgaardians.
    582046|00000000||Ciril saw it, too. Go on, tell them Ciril.
    582043|00000000||Mhm.
    582072|00000000||Did she worship Nilfgaardian idols, their deities?
    582074|00000000||How would I know? I'm a decent woman.
    582076|00000000||She ought to tell you herself. She will if you poke her with hot irons.
    582047|00000000||The Nilfgaardians are gone.
    582051|00000000||But she's stayed! We should birch her out of here!
    579073|00000000||He's not on the list. What did he do? Exactly.
    579075|00000000||He cozied up to 'em! Worked with 'em! Plotted! Schemed! Against the king!
    579083|00000000||Pelko Sambor, aged fifty, two children, a rye field, and one goat.
    579084|00000000||Do what you will. I'm just sayin'.
    579046|00000000||Twas like I said. He was workin' with the Black Ones. Tpff!
    575034|00000000||Over here, sir! That's him!
    575055|00000000||You lost your mind?
    575023|00000000||I knew 'em right away to be Nilfgaardians! Spies, I mean. He's hid them a week now.
    575025|00000000||You sure?
    575026|00000000||Oh, aye - Skaro's always been a fox. Ploughed up my furrow, once, the thief. I'll show him to you, show you his home. C'mon!
    577991|00000000||Come on. Show you something.
    572153|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    572421|00000000||So long.
    572154|00000000||Farewell.
    572152|00000000||What did we have yesterday?
    572155|00000000||What was that stuff we drank yesterday? After the charred oak spirit?
    572156|00000000||Me very own thrice-distilled plum brandy. Everyone's talkin' on it, though I tapped the barrel just recent.
    572644|00000000||Likely to get more patrons now.
    572647|00000000||Truth be told, got me hands full with you lot. But, aye, place'll likely fill up more come evenin'.
    572862|00000000||I cannot work out why the old inn wife abandoned this tavern and moved to Rustone.
    572151|00000000||Sadly, all out of curdled milk… if your head's swimmin', that is.
    577752|00000000||Hmm.
    577753|00000000||Bad luck.
    577751|00000000||Old tracks, but…
   1044165|002e13b4||Bear
    575125|00000000||You just invent this count bit? Quite the imagination for one who's sober.
    575503|00000000||Geralt'll vouch for me. Tell him - I've always said I'm a count.
    575505|00000000||True. You have always said so.
    575507|00000000||Just nobody's bothered to verify it, hahahah.
    575509|00000000||What's with this count business all of a sudden?
    575527|00000000||Well, when we finally leave this gods-forsaken dung hole, I plan to reclaim my heritage - the titles and estates that are rightfully mine.
    575588|00000000||And what'll you do with them?
    575590|00000000||Got plans for all these lands and titles?
    575592|00000000||I'll take possession of them. 'Course, there's also the issue of progeny…
    575594|00000000||Is that so? Mean you finally found a lassie worthy of the great Dandelion?
    575595|00000000||My dear friend and companion, why, my heart belongs to the one and only Priscilla, known also as Callonetta.
    575617|00000000||Your heart might, true… but the rest of your anatomy…
    575619|00000000||I resent the insinuation! And hasten to remind you that you are talking to a count!
   1075523|00000000||No need for the count to get riled. Rather you told us how your beloved is.
   1075532|00000000||She's recovered. Back to full health physically. Mentally - almost.
   1075534|00000000||Recovered? What'd I miss?
   1075536|00000000||Ah, right… Ended up not hearing about it?
   1075538|00000000||She was attacked. Around the time you were in Novigrad. Bugger hurt her somethin' awful.
   1075540|00000000||But as I said, she's getting better. Even started performing again. Thank the gods.
   1075529|00000000||Recovered, mostly. Even started singing again. Her voice is a little lower pitched, gravelly… Actually sounds a little better.
   1075546|00000000||Thanks for helping back then, Geralt. Meant a lot. Really.
   1075548|00000000||What're friends for…?
   1075542|00000000||Sorry I couldn't help you out. Had to--
   1075544|00000000||Forget about it, Geralt. Done and gone.
   1075550|00000000||Give her my best.
   1075552|00000000||Don't worry, I will. Give her a kiss, even - a bit from you, mostly from me!
    570444|00000000||I'm going hunting.
    571969|00000000||I'm going rabbit hunting. Dandelion?
    571971|00000000||Glad to have some rabbit stew. But freezing my ass off to amass the ingredients? Did not sign up for that.
    571973|00000000||I'll gather the herbs, spices. No stew is complete without some sun-drenched thyme and the aroma of rosemary…
    571975|00000000||Aye, fields're covered with rosemary bloomin' like wild just before Yule, aren't they?
    571977|00000000||That's why I'll be gathering my herbs from the kitchen.
    575654|00000000||Eh, so long.
   1061558|00000000||You're heartless, the lot of yous! Even them Black Ones showed more mercy!
   1061560|00000000||Oh, Black Ones showed you lots, I wager, might've even paid you, eh? I've seen uglier…
   1061562|00000000||Get inside, woman. Unwise to raise a row.
   1061564|00000000||Heheheh.
   1061553|00000000||Two sacks of barley, one of buckwheat, three none too plump hens, and one goat lean as grass.
   1061702|00000000||Is that all?
   1061704|00000000||Yes, sir. I looked twice to be sure they've not stowed nothin' away.
   1061555|00000000||Then look a third time. On the double!
    574465|00000000||Meaning they'll be burnin' witches.
    574466|00000000||Where they gonna find witches round here?
    574485|00000000||Oh, don't you worry, they will.
    584377|00000000||This Lord Dagborg, who is he? Some relation of the noble we had before?
    584379|00000000||How am I to know?
    575975|00000000||What's he sayin'?
   1008572|00000000||That there's to be new taxes.
    578012|00000000||Really interested?
    578015|00000000||You actually interested?
    578018|00000000||Absolutely. You said it yourself - a royal griffin's a rare sight.
    578020|00000000||Not that rare. Venture to say we'll have to slay a couple more before we get back to Kaer Morhen. But if you wanna see the nest, it's just up the hill.
    578025|00000000||Come!
    578022|00000000||We should pick up the snares.
    578031|00000000||Mislav will collect them. And we should probably try to hunt along the way.
    578065|00000000||Just this morning the rabbits were a matter of life and death.
    578067|00000000||To be honest, I just wanted to go for a walk with you.
    578069|00000000||Let's go, then. Nest is just up the hill. Griffin's carcass might still be there.
    578071|00000000||Mmm, splendid!
    578011|00000000||We should collect the traps.
    577994|00000000||Not up to hunting rabbits anymore?
    577996|00000000||Tsk. Not really.
    577998|00000000||What now?
    578000|00000000||Nothing. Just sitting, waiting for you. It's nice here.
    578002|00000000||Ah, wait till you see Dol Blathanna in winter. And the Blue Mountains.
    578010|00000000||We'll head east soon as the snow melts. Think we might've settled in a bit too much…
    578004|00000000||You promised to show me that griffin's nest before we left. Let's go now.
   1061583|00000000||Sir… My grain…
   1061585|00000000||Don't interfere. Military operation underway.
   1061726|00000000||In my field? Midst my grain? D'you know its worth?
   1061587|00000000||Well, we dug up a chest of Nilfgaardian gold out by your boundary line. Would you wager your grain's dearer?
   1061728|00000000||Now, I expect if we're thorough, we're like to find more. Midst your grain…
   1061730|00000000||But--
   1061732|00000000||Off you go! And be sure to stay in the village. We'll want a word with you.
   1061581|00000000||Deeper, now! Dig deeper!
   1061724|00000000||You're to sift through every inch, is that clear?! Every fucking mole hole!
    458124|f759b018||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    577129|00000000||A werewolf…
    552365|00000000||Brr, it's cold.
    563748|00000000||Come on.
    579546|00000000||Hm?
    578145|00000000||All right. Enough. Let's go fishing.
    578135|00000000||Ciri? What're you talking about?
    578138|00000000||I'm sorry. It's just… it's not a good time.
    578141|00000000||Wanna head back?
    578125|00000000||What?
    577573|00000000||A hair faster - that's all it needed to be to rip your shoulder wide open.
    577574|00000000||But it wasn't and it didn't. We killed it. What is this about?
    577575|00000000||You're angry, wanted to unload. But be that careless, and next time--
    577576|00000000||Don't you understand?! There won't be a next time!
    577680|00000000||I'll improvise. Wait here.
    577682|00000000||With bombs.
    577676|00000000||I'll be damned…
    577677|00000000||Should we go?
    577678|00000000||No, no way.
    578161|00000000||Lake's gotta be full of perch, bream, or pollard. Mmm... fresh pollard - would you like that?
    578165|00000000||I wouldn't mind some, but... do we plan to wait here until he leaves?
    578167|00000000||No, we'll scare him off.
    578171|00000000||How?
   1061579|00000000||Ah, poor Milos.
   1061773|00000000||I see no reason for pity. He done got chummy with the Black Ones. Just deserts.
   1061777|00000000||Hmm. He peered at me all funny a month back. Now I know why.
   1061775|00000000||Nilfgaardian treasure! He didn't peep a word to us about it.
   1061779|00000000||I wonder, I do, what they'll dig up.
   1061571|00000000||D'you see? Redanians in Milos' field - harrowin', diggin' it up?
   1061573|00000000||Now?! Why, they'll destroy his harvest, trample the grain!
   1061575|00000000||Pfff, grain! Folk say the Black'uns buried somethin' in that field, commanded Milos to sow wheat to hide it.
   1061769|00000000||Aaah!
   1061771|00000000||Come on. Let's see if they found anythin'.
    575860|00000000||There, in that hut!
    575853|00000000||Help, untie me…
   1059138|00000000||Hold up, sir! I beg ye!
   1059141|00000000||What's the problem?
   1059143|00000000||Soldiers've bound 'em! There! In the hut!
   1062036|00000000||Bound who?
   1062038|00000000||They've got me dad! And Uncle Bogurt! And Klimko! Help me!
    578973|00000000||I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
    578986|00000000||Haha, more likely you'd just say I stole them.
    578988|00000000||Heheheh.
    578975|00000000||Dimwits.
    578978|00000000||Weren't you supposed to be somewhere?
    578980|00000000||Yeah.
    578983|00000000||All right.
    579026|00000000||Where'd you agree to meet?
    579028|00000000||By the huntsman's cottage.
    579007|00000000||I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
    579009|00000000||More likely you'd just say I stole them.
    579011|00000000||Heheheh.
    579013|00000000||Dimwits.
    579016|00000000||You were supposed to be somewhere.
    579018|00000000||I was.
    579021|00000000||Fine.
    579030|00000000||Where will you meet?
    579032|00000000||Near the huntsman's cottage.
    579035|00000000||Can I get ye more of that hooch you praised so high yesterday?
    579037|00000000||Nah, gotta go. Promised I'd be at the huntsman's cottage at the crack of dawn.
    579039|00000000||Oh, aye, that's right - rabbit huntin'.
    579041|00000000||Mhm.
    578990|00000000||I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
    578992|00000000||Hahaha. More likely you'd just say I stole them.
    578994|00000000||Heheheh.
    578996|00000000||Dimwits.
    578920|00000000||Glad to see the horse is in good hands.
   1074799|00000000||The best. His owner's. D'you miss me, Gulden, huh? D'you miss me?
   1074801|00000000||I'd say he did. Bolted off soon as he sensed you. Toppled anyone in his way.
   1074803|00000000||Um… D'you mark anyone calling after 'im? "Ploughing armpits" or somesuch?
   1075628|00000000||But one man here curses so odd. My neighbor, Mirko. Gave him Gulden to care for when I left… Oughta go see 'im, must be worried.
   1075631|00000000||Here… Token o' my appreciation. For running after Gulden, to see he was all right.
    578904|00000000||Can see the horse is in good hands.
    578951|00000000||And madman Radovid wins it in the end. Simple soldiers know that man's missing a joining peg.
   1075606|00000000||But things could be looking up. Folk say Chancellor Dijkstra's a wise one, rules by reason…
   1075608|00000000||Wise? Cunning's probably more accurate.
    578953|00000000||But I wonder what awaits me back home…
    578955|00000000||Didn't see the emperor take Novigrad, but I don't regret it. Beautiful city…
    578910|00000000||Been away long?
    578912|00000000||A year, not quite. But it feels like more, lemme tell you.
    578924|00000000||They force you to join?
    578914|00000000||Nah. I was eager to fight. Thought I'd bring home more'n just the scars on my back.
    578922|00000000||Did see a chunk of the world, though. Some mammoth battles. A few famous generals from afar. And lots of whoresons.
    578903|00000000||Been away long?
    578902|00000000||Which side were you on?
    578906|00000000||Which side you fight for?
    578908|00000000||Like most - my own. Fought to stay alive.
    578918|00000000||Dyin's all the same - dirt and shite, be it under the Redanian eagle or the imperial sun. No glory in it.
    578885|00000000||To think the nag would know me after all these years…
    578899|00000000||They're smart, grow attached - bit like people. Saw officers weep for their fallen mounts…
    578901|00000000||Though wailin' women and cryin' babes didn't move 'em one bit.
    578957|00000000||Word is the emperor poisoned his own army. There's politics for you. Boggles the mind.
    582809|00000000||Oh, thank ye for that, witcher. Told the lads back then you're a good fella, and we shouldn'ta took your boat.
    583261|00000000||Heard you've gone into investments, asset management…
    583263|00000000||Aye, aye - investments in moveable assets. Well, these days you just never know when--
    583265|00000000||That extra gold chalice could come in handy, I get it.
    583267|00000000||What'd you do with it?
    583268|00000000||Uh, we don't have it. Found a buyer. Mr. Mirrory, was it? Funny name, paid good coin, though.
    583274|00000000||We'd share it with you, we would, but you look like one who'd just frown on any proceeds from theft.
    583276|00000000||Aye, you got that righteous frown on you. Definitely.
    583286|00000000||I don't want your coin.
    583287|00000000||Aheheheh! Look at him, all offended! You'd think we showed him a picture of a naked lass.
    583290|00000000||Witchers got their creed. No stealin', no pinchin' wenches at the tavern, and no assaultin' travelers.
    583292|00000000||We make exceptions. For travelers, especially.
    583294|00000000||Uh, oh… er… Farewell, witcher.
    583278|00000000||Don't worry. I don't want your coin.
    583277|00000000||Since you insist, I'll take the coin.
    583279|00000000||Won't say no to friends. Actually, I'll gladly take some of that coin.
    583281|00000000||Witchers' ethics. Pfft! World's going to shite.
    583284|00000000||Least we nicked his dinghy.
    582142|00000000||They've come for us! Hide!
   1059837|00000000||Zzzzzz… heh. Heh?
    583252|00000000||What's going on?
    582143|00000000||You've not seen us!
    583244|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
    583246|00000000||Our affairs brought us here. Hard times, you know. Got to earn a coin where you can.
    583249|00000000||Folk around here need surveyors?
    583255|00000000||We've shifted our efforts. Investors now.
    583258|00000000||Investors?
    583179|00000000||What are you doing here?
    583180|00000000||You stole my boat.
    583184|00000000||You stole my boat.
    583189|00000000||Borrowed. We knew it was yours, still is. You don't think we'd do that to a mate like you - plough you soapless while you slept off a bender?
   1059839|00000000||Zzzzzz… mheh… hm? Oh, that's good. Heheheh zzzzz…
    583192|00000000||So, gonna give me my boat back?
    583236|00000000||Why in the gods' names would you need a boat in this brush?
    583238|00000000||Fair enough, forget I said anything.
    583996|00000000||All right. Out.
    583166|00000000||How was your trip? Smooth sailing?
    582136|00000000||You still on about that leaky tub from the Isle of Mists? You're lucky you and that lass weren't in it with us.
    583171|00000000||You'd not 'ave fit anyhow. 'Twas so laden that boat, we barely made land.
    583173|00000000||And it reeked of fish manure.
   1059835|00000000||Zzzzzz…
    579282|00000000||You never gave me piggyback rides at Kaer Morhen, remember? Vesemir was the only one willing.
    579280|00000000||Ugh!
    579284|00000000||Had to wait till now to remind me? You've put on some weight since Kaer Morhen.
    579287|00000000||{Hahahah.}
    579289|00000000||{Hahahah.}
    579292|00000000||Ciri?
    579294|00000000||We should get back.
    569886|00000000||Many thanks! I'd never 'ave caught him myself.
   1074807|00000000||Ploughin' ear pits! Who's this? Hubrecht! That explains why Gulden was so frisky! Bucking like a horsefly'd bit 'im!
   1074809|00000000||Good to see you, Mirko. You've not changed a bit. Not a smidgen.
   1074811|00000000||Inside with you. Throw off your cloak, set yourself by the hearth! I’ll just tie Gulden off and be back in a flash with a flask!
    578096|00000000||She's gone.
    577477|00000000||Mad she had to wait?
    577478|00000000||No, eager to roam the fields. Prepared the cover scents and oiled the jaw traps all by herself.
    577479|00000000||Make a good hunter, wouldn't she?
    577480|00000000||Nah. Too impatient, that one.
    578109|00000000||Probably snatchin' rabbits barehanded, puttin' 'em in the traps 'cause they're too slow to step in themselves.
    577481|00000000||Where'd she go?
    578103|00000000||Not far. Over yonder.
    578106|00000000||Farewell.
    574033|00000000||Understood?
    574039|00000000||He can be a friend, he can be your brother - I do not care.
    578814|00000000||Deserters must be executed on sight. No trial.
    574037|00000000||Robbery of artwork from temples or elsewhere is forbidden. All instances will be punishable by death.
    578858|00000000||All such items are subject to official confiscation. They will be packed, sealed and transported to Nilfgaard.
    578861|00000000||Bonus pay to be awarded accordingly upon our return.
    172334|06c10782||Skellige Woman
    568547|00000000||Help me!
    568544|00000000||Heeeeyyyy! Bloody hell! Ooooow! Ploughin' earpits!
    595891|fbee3e23||Peasant
   1061290|00000000||We march in two hours!
   1061734|00000000||Any man not standing ready in full outfit will be considered a deserter.
   1061736|00000000||You have grown lazy, shit-heels, drinking your Temerian wheat beer!
   1061738|00000000||I shall remind what it means - the imperial army marching!
    577221|00000000||The Crone, what's she done to you?
    577308|00000000||Stole my daughter's medallion.
    577310|00000000||Heed my words. The Crone will fight like a hounded wolverine. She may cripple, even kill you…
    583061|00000000||Why risk it? Find the girl a new pendant. Her sorrow will pass in time.
    577312|00000000||No, it won't. My daughter's dead.
    577218|00000000||Fine.
    577223|00000000||Speak.
    577224|00000000||There's a wolf den nearby. Wolf cubs inside. Carry them out of the swamp.
    577225|00000000||Why?
    577226|00000000||They'll not survive here, or they'll change into something… evil.
    578819|00000000||I'll try.
    578948|00000000||No.
    577217|00000000||No.
    577141|00000000||None. How many have you already killed? How many more might you still?
    577142|00000000||I don't know. Mostly I had no choice in the matter. 'Tis a foul age.
    577143|00000000||That it is.
    577182|00000000||A last wish?
    577139|00000000||No.
    577212|00000000||There's one. Find the Crone, guide me through the swamp - to her.
    577213|00000000||And then?
    577214|00000000||Then I'll see.
    577215|00000000||Uh… The Crone, what's she done to you?
    577216|00000000||Stole my daughter's medallion.
    577304|00000000||If I may… why risk it? The Crone'll fight. Like a hounded wolverine, she'll fight. She may cripple, even kill you.
    583084|00000000||Find the girl a new pendant. Her sorrow will pass in time.
    577305|00000000||No, it won't. My daughter's dead.
    577307|00000000||Go.
    577140|00000000||There's one.
    577130|00000000||Who are you?
    577131|00000000||You know who I am. And why I'm here.
    577132|00000000||I do. You needn't… I'm no longer a threat. I starve, for the swamp is poisoned. I've no strength to hunt humans.
    577133|00000000||Crone summon you?
    577134|00000000||In my sleep… once I had wolf dreams. Now I dream hunger, pain, and blood.
    577135|00000000||Where is she?
    577136|00000000||Out there… in the swamp.
    577181|00000000||Is there no other way?
    573702|00000000||They're only rumors. The emperor has no reason to plunder Novigrad. It would be like pouring coin from one pocket to another.
    573703|00000000||My father claims there's a vault beneath the Temple of the Eternal Fire. And the emperor will empty it to hire mercenaries.
    573704|00000000||That is different. Novigrad's merchants will hardly protest to see the emperor disperse the priests to the four winds.
    516508|b0678eeb||Horse
   1061683|00000000||The further we venture from the Holy Flame of the One True Faith, the vaster the dark of superstition.
   1061362|00000000||Here in the country, they don't even know how oft they blaspheme the Holy Fire.
   1061684|00000000||It's certainly better here. Novigrad's heretics have gone all clever.
   1061686|00000000||Show them iron burning red and the mongrels' sons entangle you in ethical debates.
   1061366|00000000||As I see it, more fuel for the pyres out here. We've landed well, no doubt about it.
    577544|00000000||We were supposed to train today.
    577545|00000000||Uh-huh.
    577546|00000000||Tomorrow at sunup, then?
   1068722|00000000||Work you hard like I did in the good old days.
   1068724|00000000||Probably been a while since anyone showed you just how much you still have to learn.
    577547|00000000||Mhm.
   1068727|00000000||Ahem. Almost there.
    553394|00000000||Remember me training on the pendulum?
   1068716|00000000||How I feared I'd never manage, yet you forbade me from giving up?
   1068718|00000000||I was black and blue practically all the time. That pendulum was a nightmare.
    553397|00000000||How could I forget?
    553398|00000000||Those months at Kaer Morhen - they passed so quickly.
    562408|00000000||I wish we'd spent more time together then.
    578869|00000000||What's your name, werewolf?
    578870|00000000||Berem.
    578871|00000000||Lead me to the Crone, Berem.
    577227|00000000||Maybe, once, in a different time… I'd have helped.
   1065298|00000000||I can't look at this… You must die…
   1065300|00000000||Stay out of it!
    579153|00000000||One cub lives…
    579154|00000000||Come on, no time for that.
    579155|00000000||Won't survive on its own.
    579156|00000000||Lead me to the Crone.
    578938|00000000||She's close. Somewhere here…
    578939|00000000||Go back to your wolf dreams, Berem. Save the cub. Go away, far away. Find yourself a comely wifewolf. And live.
    578940|00000000||Let me help you.
    578941|00000000||No.
    578942|00000000||Remember - like a hounded wolverine she'll fight. She could kill you.
    578943|00000000||I know. Now go.
   1061689|00000000||Don't say much about politics on account I don't know much. But first thing's first - you need assets, always.
   1061691|00000000||Three hundred fifty, three sixty…
   1061693|00000000||Grab them by their coin purses, and they'll follow, hearts and minds.
   1061695|00000000||Four hundred ten, four twenty…
   1061697|00000000||Black Ones left behind quite a lot, too. The chest we found, that was… how much?
   1061699|00000000||Four hundred… For fuck's sake, I told yous! Either I sht-- stop drinkin', or yous fuckin' stop interruptin' me!
    583007|00000000||Despair devours you like maggots devour a corpse!
    583009|00000000||Your flesh cured with toxins… sweet with pain.
    583011|00000000||She suffered too. Miserable and alone. Oh, so alone…
    583013|00000000||This shall haunt you forever.
    579063|00000000||Not anymore.
    582987|00000000||Do you wish to die, witcher? Do you wish your suffering to end?
    578944|00000000||You've changed. You suffer.
    578946|00000000||You seek death, I feel it. I know the smell of a suicide's breath… The omens do not lie.
    578947|00000000||That little whore, her accursed blood… She slew my sisters. I am alone - 'tis your doing.
    584873|00000000||"The flash that cuts…"
    584867|00000000||"Dubhenn haern am glâdeal, morc'h am fhean aiesin."
    584869|00000000||"The flash that cuts through darkness, the light that breaks the night."
    584871|00000000||Exactly.
    584855|00000000||Classic Elder Speech runes. No styling, simple and precise.
    584857|00000000||May I?
    584859|00000000||It is yours. If you'd like to test it - had my lacqueys put out a training dummy.
    584861|00000000||Mhm. Your payment - gems only, as requested.
    584863|00000000||If you've an eye out for work, heard a striga's prowling the Maribor Forest.
    584864|00000000||Thanks. Need to visit the tavern first, but after… who knows?
    584865|00000000||Good luck on the Path, witcher.
    584895|00000000||"Zireael." Swallow.
    584872|00000000||"Zireael."
    584875|00000000||You're late.
    584877|00000000||Soldiers…
    584879|00000000||…blocking the roads, I know. No matter. You have it?
    584881|00000000||As agreed.
    584883|00000000||Thirty-eight and a half inch blade. Weight - just under 40 ounces. Silver-plated siderite steel core. Glyphs and runes both the length of the blade and on the hilt.
    584885|00000000||Beautiful.
    584887|00000000||Been in this trade for three decades. Only the best swordsmen have the coin for my wares.
    584889|00000000||When I say no witcher has, or ever had, a better weapon, you ought to trust me.
    584891|00000000||Reputation precedes you, Master Ort. I'd never doubt you.
    584893|00000000||The inscription, as you asked…
    575206|00000000||Old man always had a soft spot for me. He could sense I was a family man, a man of peace… Good-natured like himself.
    575224|00000000||Woulda never crossed his mind to disown me if it wasn't for that hag I call my "sister."
    575226|00000000||What's the name again? Count Julian Alphonzo de what?
    575232|00000000||Viscount Julian Alfred Pankratz de Lettenhove.
    575233|00000000||Hahahahah!
    575234|00000000||Don't believe me? Just watch - you'll wipe that doubting leer off your face when we go visit my estates!
    575467|00000000||Hahahahah!
    577548|00000000||Careful now.
    577549|00000000||This is no time for you to lecture me.
    577550|00000000||Ciri, wait. There's something in the--
    577551|00000000||We really don't need to play hare and hounds.
    577552|00000000||Ciri!
    581646|00000000||Come clean, hand them over, and you might come out of this with your life.
    581648|00000000||He tell you this?
    584960|00000000||Go on, search my house. You'll find nothin' and no one.
    581649|00000000||We shall see.
    576003|00000000||Mercy, sir…
    576004|00000000||Enough!
    584988|00000000||Me? Never! Did he say that?
    581635|00000000||Come with us.
    584991|00000000||Hehehe.
    584993|00000000||You bastard!
    585004|00000000||Take him.
    575076|00000000||They say you harbor Nilfgaard's spies in your home.
   1059136|00000000||Oi! You there! Sod off! In the name of the king!
    575878|00000000||Folk say you hide unholy books.
    575867|00000000||Sir, I-I don't even kn-know how t-to r-read.
    575879|00000000||We shall see.
    575871|00000000||I swear by all the gods that…
    575884|00000000||Aha! Blasphemy! Been some time since we've had someone pulled behind the horses.
    575883|00000000||Mercy!
    575971|00000000||Out.
    575986|00000000||Gotsta clean this up.
    575987|00000000||And quick.
    172316|3a2616f8||Witch Hunter
   1055084|06691856||Peasant
    578825|00000000||I sense a wolf… and men.
    578826|00000000||How many?
    578827|00000000||Ten, no more.
    578828|00000000||Stay out of it.
    585744|00000000||Probably got held back.
   1059036|00000000||Master Ort!
   1061386|00000000||Hmm…
   1062260|00000000||Radovid had many faults. He was cruel, impetuous and pathologically ambitious.
   1062262|00000000||But he was a tactical genius – that's undeniable. Commanding forces far outnumbered by his foe's, he handily defeated the invader from the south.
   1062264|00000000||The Redanian Eagle spread its wings, taking all the North, including Novigrad, beneath them.
   1062266|00000000||The 3rd Northern War was a clash between two great strategists: Radovid V, known as "The Stern," and Emhyr var Emreis.
   1062268|00000000||Both seemed invincible, yet both were defeated. Nilfgaard, invading from the south, was repelled in the field, while the North's "supreme leader" fell victim to assassins.
   1062270|00000000||Yet Redania stood victorious, and a man who had thus far operated in shadow took up the reins of power. That man was Sigismund Dijkstra.
   1062254|00000000||The 3rd Northern War ended – the invader from the south achieved complete victory.
   1062256|00000000||Robbed of Radovid's tactical genius, the Northern Realms could not withstand Emhyr's countless legions.
   1062258|00000000||Black banners appeared over Novigrad and all Redania.
   1062273|00000000||With victory in the war against Nilfgaard secured, Radovid proceeded to complete his witch hunt.
   1062275|00000000||As they had in Novigrad, pyres burned in Temeria and Aedirn, lands now "liberated" by the Redanian monarch. In the drive for moral renewal, simple herbalists, pellars, healers and nonhumans – all supposed heretics – were murdered in droves.
   1062277|00000000||For many, freedom beneath Radovid's scepter proved more tragic than servitude to another.
   1062279|00000000||Once firmly in the chancellor's seat, Dijkstra ruled the victorious North in his patently cynical and ruthless manner.
   1062281|00000000||He knew that to preserve peace he would need to prepare for war. Following Nilfgaard's example, he consolidated his rule over vast lands through a broad program of settlement and industrialization.
   1062283|00000000||All for the good of his subjects – though often contrary to their will.
   1062285|00000000||Weary of rebel raids, Emhyr var Emreis conceded, restoring Temeria as a realm in liege to the empire.
   1062287|00000000||When the guerillas laid down their arms, the emperor shifted his forces to other fronts.
   1062289|00000000||Through Nilfgaard's victory, Temerians got their country back, and history, once again, proved a consummate trickster.
   1062291|00000000||Having dealt with Radovid, Emhyr var Emreis did the same with enemies domestic.
   1062293|00000000||The emperor's loyal spies named all who had conspired against him – traders, soldiers and aristocrats alike.
   1062295|00000000||Though their mutiny had only been a murky plan, the emperor showed no mercy. As was his wont.
   1062297|00000000||As long as his armies went from one victory to the next, Emhyr's subjects remained boundlessly obedient.
   1062299|00000000||When a string of humiliating defeats proved var Emreis fallible, the opposition – thus far secret – attacked.
   1062301|00000000||The subjects of the emperor who had danced on the graves of his foes laid him to rest in a tomb of his own.
   1062303|00000000||While the Continent bled engulfed by war, Skellige bloomed under Cerys' enlightened rule.
   1062305|00000000||Unlike those who had come before her, the young queen did not raid foreign shores, looking instead to her people, tending to her land.
   1062307|00000000||The island-bound nation prospered, though its fangs of yore were dulled.
   1062309|00000000||Though the war on the Continent had ended, Hjalmar refused to lay down his arms.
   1062311|00000000||The young king pledged to raid and burn the shores of the Empire of Nilfgaard each spring. He meant to keep his word, even at the cost of drowning his people in their own blood.
   1062313|00000000||Many islanders believed Svanrige would be no more than his ambitious mother's puppet. The young king proved them wrong, ignoring her whims and ruling with an iron hand all his own.
   1062315|00000000||Tired of the jarls and their endless feuds, he resolved to turn the Isles into an absolute monarchy modeled after those of the Continent.
   1062317|00000000||What he resolved, he achieved, but only by shedding his countrymen's blood.
   1062319|00000000||Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon, heir to Nilfgaard's throne, chose the life of a witcher, on the Path.
   1062321|00000000||Geralt taught her all he knew, every skill he possessed, then each set off on their own.
   1062323|00000000||Soon word of the ashen-haired witcheress had spread throughout the North – from the Yaruga to the mountains of Kovir…
   1062325|00000000||After years in exile, Ciri returned to Nilfgaard, her paternal home, where Emhyr prepared to name her his successor.
   1062327|00000000||The woman had the necessary qualities. From her father she'd inherited an empress' political instincts. From Geralt she had gained a sense of simple, human decency.
   1062329|00000000||Few monarchs boast both traits – which is quite a shame…
   1062331|00000000||As for Ciri? That's hard to say. Since the events on Undvik, she has yet to be seen.
   1062333|00000000||Which does not mean she is never to return.
   1062335|00000000||Hard as it may be to believe, Geralt planted roots – in faraway Kovir.
   1062337|00000000||He and Triss settled down, their home warm and smelling of freshly baked cakes. Guests were always welcome, no matter the day or the hour.
   1062339|00000000||The witcher would take jobs at times, more from habit than need. For Triss earned a true fortune as the mage advisor to Kovir's king.
   1062341|00000000||"And, what of Geralt?" you might ask. Well…
   1062343|00000000||He continued on as before, living hand to mouth, job to job, on the road, ever coinless.
   1062345|00000000||We would meet at times over a glass of strong drink  to talk about the old days and speculate what could have, would have, might have been…
   1062347|00000000||While monarchs moved borders and populations, Geralt and Yennefer lived a calm, quiet life far from all things political.
   1062349|00000000||They breakfasted well after noon, more often than not in bed, and passed the days on lazy strolls and long conversations.
   1062351|00000000||Boring, you say? Perhaps. But both had sought this more than anything else.
   1052050|00000000||Master witcher! Over here! Plenty of blades to try, if it's your will…?!
   1061302|00000000||Quick, now, with that wheel!
   1061741|00000000||Or will you stay to welcome Radovid's men?!
    574752|00000000||Next!
    574757|00000000||Will anyone else come forward?
   1062041|00000000||That is all for today! Disperse!
    574758|00000000||You! Yes, you.
    572807|00000000||The gentleman will follow.
    572810|00000000||His Imperial Majesty awaits.
    595913|6b1268cb||Peasant
    583129|00000000||Hey! Grab him!
    583128|00000000||This is how all traitors will end. We'll burn the rebellion's seed to the ground.
    584088|00000000||You can watch, from afar.
    171353|39b3095b||Redanian Soldier
    577981|00000000||An old witchers' trick for tough winters. Not terribly subtle, but…
    577983|00000000||Effective.
    577985|00000000||Mhm. Remember, don't ever do this.
    577987|00000000||Why show it to me at all, then?
    577989|00000000||Just in case. Never know what could happen on the Path, what could save your life.
    578288|00000000||Yeah we do.
    578689|00000000||Yeah we do.
    578692|00000000||You could come with me.
    578694|00000000||No, Ciri. That's not me, you know that.
    578696|00000000||I know, but… I thought--
    578698|00000000||You've made your decision. And I made mine long ago.
    578700|00000000||War's over. I'll have plenty of work chasing monsters round forgotten villages.
    578703|00000000||When do you leave?
    578709|00000000||Now.
    578764|00000000||Won't you at least give Yennefer some time to pack?
    578711|00000000||Won't you at least give Triss some time to pack?
    578714|00000000||So this is…
    578338|00000000||Course we don't.
    578347|00000000||I don't know when we'll see each other again.
    578349|00000000||You know where to find me.
    578353|00000000||You can't possibly stay at Kaer Morhen all the time.
    578355|00000000||Makes no difference. You'll find me.
    578375|00000000||True.
    578361|00000000||Remember what I taught you. Never know - could be useful there, too…
    578286|00000000||Course not.
    578248|00000000||Is this what you want?
    578258|00000000||Yes.
    578261|00000000||You'll not try to stop me? Take me to the Blue Mountains by force?
    578775|00000000||Traveled half the world to find you, but I never intended to force anything on you.
    578283|00000000||I know.
    578781|00000000||You'll be fine, you're a witcher.
    578285|00000000||We needn't say goodbye.
    578219|00000000||This what you want?
    578750|00000000||If you mean to suggest Yennefer had anything to do with this, then the answer is no.
    578754|00000000||Great. She even know?
    578756|00000000||No. And I'd prefer she not get involved this time.
    578761|00000000||I'll let you tell her that.
    578752|00000000||If you're asking whether Emhyr threatened to send the Alba Division after you if I didn't agree, then the answer is no.
    578767|00000000||Letter must've been convincing, then.
    578769|00000000||It was.
    578748|00000000||You make this choice on your own?
    578739|00000000||You make this choice on your own?
    578223|00000000||Could've told me.
    578221|00000000||You could've told me, warned me.
    578222|00000000||I wanted to, but… I didn't know how. I've been happy here. I was afraid I'd ruin it. I wanted to make every minute count.
    578777|00000000||So, back at the nest - that was about this.
    578779|00000000||I didn't pry, didn't want to force you to tell me. Thought we had time. A lot more time.
    578706|00000000||They're here for me, Geralt. I'm going to Nilfgaard. To Emhyr.
    578728|00000000||I know you didn't expect this, but…
    578730|00000000||In Vizima, my father and I spoke… for long. Argued, really, and parted. Then a messenger came, with a letter. I didn't say anything at first because I wasn't sure, and then…
    578738|00000000||I realized I had to stop fleeing. Realized that if I wish to change anything, I cannot do so hunting monsters round forgotten villages. I must do so from there. From Nilfgaard.
    578687|00000000||Almost managed to forget it was today.
    574832|00000000||Mariella! Will you wait for me?
    574833|00000000||Ah, I will.
    574827|00000000||You're all talk.
    574828|00000000||I will come back for you, I promise!
    574830|00000000||Yes, if only you'd done half what you promised!
    582400|00000000||I'll come back and take you to Nilfgaard.
    582402|00000000||You were to stay here!
    175619|ea15b01b||Innkeep
    552440|00000000||Out on a hunt, master witcher? Thought you'd cleared the area of beasts your last time through.
    552441|00000000||Rabbit hunting this time around.
    552971|00000000||Aah, so that's it.
    552972|00000000||Maybe you'd come 'round, visit us this eventide? Verka's bakin' a pie.
    552979|00000000||Hm, don't know if…
    552984|00000000||As you will. You're always welcome.
    586286|00000000||Do you see them? They've come to the feast! I shall feed them your pain!
    586287|00000000||Best go back where they came from if they value their lives. I've come for you.
    586288|00000000||They know you'll not spare them… You're a witcher, a murderer. You hunt down and kill.
    586289|00000000||Can't be bothered any more.
    586290|00000000||Do what you want - you can still go. None who stay will leave here alive.
    586291|00000000||Kill him!
    579064|00000000||I sense your pain. I see your fear…
    579065|00000000||Look about you! Feel their hatred? You slaughtered their brethren for a fistful of coin. They would see you suffer, while you've lost your claws, wolf.
    579066|00000000||The prophecies do not lie… You cannot survive this struggle.
    579067|00000000||Zireael is dead. Naught but a small frozen corpse in an icy wilderness.
    579068|00000000||And you are afraid… You feel fear.
    579069|00000000||You lie. I don't feel a thing anymore.
    578824|00000000||Patience, sisters. I sense him, he comes. You shall yet have his soul…
    578936|00000000||His pain, his icy suffering will be yours. And you will feast on him.
    578937|00000000||Soon, sisters, very soon.
    578958|00000000||Come out!
    576137|00000000||Be sure to take all your rubbish with you. Leave nothing behind, not one lice-ridden rag, hear me?
    576139|00000000||Tsk. We'll need to lime wash the walls anyway.
    576147|00000000||Nilfgaardian mutts.
    581876|00000000||This is Temeria, understand?
    581878|00000000||We shall see for how long.
    582555|00000000||Mahakaman double mead. Wonder where they pilfered this.
    582569|00000000||Enough stew to feed an army.
    582586|00000000||Wonder if they'll catch them.
    582538|00000000||Takes nerve to camp so close to the road.
    582556|00000000||Chalice isn't here.
    582557|00000000||Hm, looks like they're investing in movable assets now.
    581194|00000000||Evil eye! He's with the witch - get him!
    581170|00000000||Permit not the witch to lead her unholy life, burn all filth away with the fire most hallowed…
    581188|00000000||Shut it, witch!
   1068563|00000000||Come, now!
    578847|00000000||Don't make me kill you.
    578850|00000000||Calm down. We don't need to fight.
    578851|00000000||Just go. And the Lady of the Swamp - you leave her be…
    578836|00000000||Fine, not interested.
    578841|00000000||True enough.
    578842|00000000||Shove off, then! You're spoilin' our fun.
    578843|00000000||[Hit him.]
    578854|00000000||I'm off.
   1065296|00000000||See ya. Got something to do.
    578845|00000000||I'm off.
    578844|00000000||Release the wolf.
    578863|00000000||Release the she-wolf.
    578864|00000000||She's not weakened yet.
    578865|00000000||She's ragin', knows she's good as dead but has yet to accept it.
    578866|00000000||Get outta here.
    578867|00000000||What? You dim in the head? Beast killed our cattle, and she'll keep huntin' - damned animal! It's the ploughin' enemy! It's her, or us!
    578868|00000000||My sentiments exactly.
    578853|00000000||Release the wolf.
    578852|00000000||[Hit him.]
    578835|00000000||Release the wolf.
    578848|00000000||Uhh…
    578849|00000000||We'll flay you alive, you wretch!
    578846|00000000||[Hit him.]
    578837|00000000||Where's the Crone?
    578838|00000000||Sod off, your kind's not welcome. Leave our lands.
    578839|00000000||Not just yet. Soon. First the Crone.
    578840|00000000||You're one. We're ten, we've got hounds. Wanna end like the she-wolf?
    578834|00000000||Where's the Crone?
    578829|00000000||What're you doin' here?
    578830|00000000||A she-wolf's been on the hunt the last few days. Killed a cow, wounded a man. So we set some traps.
    578831|00000000||Stupid beast walked straight into one, heheheh. Once she tires, we'll set the 'ounds on 'er, have us a wolf-baitin'.
    578832|00000000||What happened to your ear?
    578833|00000000||Why's it matter? None of your ploughing concern.
    584284|00000000||Bow before your new lord…
    584286|00000000||…and protector.
    584253|00000000||The noble Lord Dagborg assumes these lands to rule with grace and justice.
    584254|00000000||Debts, burdens and encumbrances owed to any other are hereby waived.
    574281|00000000||The war has caused damages that must be repaired. Taxes shall henceforth be doubled.
    574282|00000000||All who remit payment to the treasury shall receive a note for the equivalent sum.
    574278|00000000||Witches, false healers, charm merchants and filthy nonhumans are hereby deemed outlaws.
    574279|00000000||All who provide shelter to, or otherwise abet, their like shall be tried and executed by the will of the Holy Tribunal of the Eternal Fire.
    584266|00000000||What's that mean?
    584268|00000000||It means you must pay taxes to the noble Lord Dagborg now.
   1058998|00000000||Change is coming.
   1059080|00000000||Need any help? With the wagon?
   1059082|00000000||We'll manage, mate.
   1059084|00000000||We thank you for your concern.
   1059086|00000000||Aye, 'cause you don't look like no wheelwright, that's sure.
   1059088|00000000||Need help with your wagon?
   1059090|00000000||Think we'll be all right, heheh.
   1059092|00000000||Hah, aye, you betcha, we'll manage.
   1059094|00000000||True, the barrels are ample, but we shall pour some off of each soon.
   1059102|00000000||True, no denyin' it.
   1059104|00000000||Nilfgaard flees, yet here it seemed nothing could move them.
   1059112|00000000||Left their wine behind, too. That's generous.
   1059096|00000000||Grown accustomed, we have.
   1059098|00000000||With the Black Ones gone, witch hunters'll move in. Yet life'll roll on. We've to seize the day.
   1059100|00000000||True, that! So let's get to work afore night creeps up on us!
   1059116|00000000||Gotta go. Farewell.
   1059122|00000000||Time I was on my way. Good luck to you.
    584839|00000000||Good luck.
   1059013|00000000||Where you headed? Nearest inn, by the looks of it.
   1059114|00000000||Yeah. Supposed to meet someone first - at the former campsite of the Nilfgaardians. You take care, now.
   1059118|00000000||Sure you don't need any help?
   1059120|00000000||I believe we will manage.
   1059115|00000000||Sure you don't need help?
   1059107|00000000||That's the truth of it.
   1059109|00000000||The Nilfgaardians have fled, the Redanians are barely arrived, and bandits sense the void, practically feel they have free rein.
   1059111|00000000||Barely got away, then busted a wheel and watched our horses run off into the wood.
   1059072|00000000||Need a hand with your wagon?
   1059074|00000000||Err… no.
   1059076|00000000||It's not exactly ours, more a captured vehicle. Booty, you might say.
   1059078|00000000||Folk must've abandoned it in their rush - to where, I don't know. Be a shame for the Reds to claim it, loot it.
    573535|00000000||Report.
    573530|00000000||Captain!
    573536|00000000||The Novigrad delegation is half a day's travel from here.
    573537|00000000||They truly are rushing…
    577531|00000000||Return to your post.
    577533|00000000||Yes, sir.
    573538|00000000||Fourth Cate Squadron… The Frundsberg Division as a whole… Deserters…
    573539|00000000||Does General Voorhis know?
    577540|00000000||He's at a briefing, they're not letting anyone in…
    577542|00000000||Nonsense. Get in there and report to him at once.
    581879|00000000||Achoo!
    581883|00000000||Shite! Th-the witcher!
    574700|00000000||Black Ones probably thought they'd stay here forever, he, he.
    584444|00000000||Nilfgaardians, Redanians… Same shite.
    574684|00000000||And we thought the imperials were bad…
   1061437|00000000||If it weren't for us, the Black Ones woulda sat here stolid - till Yule or longer!
   1061439|00000000||Heeheeheehee! You're a hero - and all mine! Lucky me!
   1061711|00000000||Laugh if you will, but were it not for your Gordek returning and driving them Nilfgaardians off…
   1061713|00000000||Hahahaha!
   1061715|00000000||… mighta been some Cahir or Johann that woulda made off with your maidenhead!
   1061717|00000000||But you, you waited for me, my little Manny, didn't you?
   1061719|00000000||I did. I did! Hahahaha!
   1061721|00000000||Hahahahaaa!
    577594|00000000||We bring Dandelion a nice, fat perch, and he just might forget about the rabbit stew.
    577595|00000000||Mhm.
   1068729|00000000||Shame he didn't come along.
   1068731|00000000||He could use a bit of exertion.
   1068733|00000000||Mhm.
    578152|00000000||Ice shouldn't be too thick here.
    578154|00000000||Uh-huh.
    578150|00000000||How exactly do you plan to catch anything?
    578157|00000000||Heh, you'll see.
