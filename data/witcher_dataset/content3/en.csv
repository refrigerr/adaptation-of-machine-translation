    569503|00000000||A witcher! Oh, that's just perfect!
    569499|00000000||I was told I'd be received first thing in the morning. And it's past noon!
    569502|00000000||Calm yourself.
    569915|00000000||Wha– What?! Do you know who you're talking to, soldier? I'm Herevard the Second, Prince of Ellander.
    569917|00000000||Not only am I made to wait here like some supplicant, but with who for company? A tinter!
    569919|00000000||Tanner. Master of the Tanners' Guild.
    569921|00000000||As if it makes a damned difference! I demand--
    569923|00000000||Calm down.
    569925|00000000||The emperor demands silence. Those who disturb face harsh punishment. No matter their birth.
    569487|00000000||Follow me, if the gentleman pleases.
    569488|00000000||Please keep close. There are many honorable guests in the palace, whom the gentleman…
    569489|00000000||…disgusts?
    569961|00000000||…need not bother.
    570594|00000000||Once the gentleman is done, he should see me to retrieve his possessions.
    570583|00000000||Is the gentleman not in a hurry to see the sorceress?
    570581|00000000||Did I not request…?
   1044413|00000000||The gentleman will have time for a stroll later. Please stay with me.
    570571|00000000||Did the gentleman not understand? Did I not emphasize adequately that one must bow to the emperor?
    570573|00000000||Relax. Nothing happened.
    570575|00000000||To the gentleman. But I shall be punished.
    570577|00000000||How?
    570579|00000000||Please keep close and bother no one. We've had enough breaches of etiquette for one day.
   1048792|00000000||This attack took the Kaedweni by surprise. They were still mourning the loss of their king. Rudderless and dejected, they laid down their arms after a few lost skirmishes - and joined Radovid.
   1048383|00000000||What about Kovir?
   1048389|00000000||What about Kovir?
   1048391|00000000||Kovir values its neutrality. Enough not to lend its armies or, more importantly, even its coin to either side.
   1048393|00000000||Returning to the war… This spring there was a massive battle in the marshes of Velen. Massive, yet indecisive. Both sides suffered enormous losses. Unprecedented, even.
   1048396|00000000||Radovid has retreated across the Pontar. He's safe for now… until reinforcements arrive from the south. Then Emperor Emhyr var Emreis will deal with him once and for all.
   1048398|00000000||Couldn't you just go home? Save everyone a lot of marching. Not to mention a few human lives.
   1048400|00000000||I'm afraid the stakes are too high to fold now. We can only go all in.
   1048385|00000000||That admiration I hear in your voice?
   1048387|00000000||Radovid is our foe… but I cannot deny he is clever. He played us for fools. Particularly dense ones at that.
   1048375|00000000||That a note of admiration I hear?
   1048819|00000000||And so by spring, instead of two weak enemies we had only one powerful one.
   1048790|00000000||Took the Kaedweni completely by surprise. King Henselt fought on the front line, as always… and that is where he died. His soldiers lost the will to fight. They joined Radovid's ranks.
   1048684|00000000||How's the war going? I mean, apart from the fact that Nilfgaard's triumph is imminent.
   1048687|00000000||I assume this to be a private conversation. We've no witnesses, so let's dispense with propaganda, even that shrouded in irony.
   1048690|00000000||Our offensive was going splendidly - until winter came. Aedirn was in such disarray that we encountered no resistance. We had reached the Pontar before the first snows.
   1048692|00000000||Only a weakened Kaedwen remained… and Radovid's Redania, which had ignored the rest of the North's pleas for help. We thought they'd sue for peace, perhaps even submit to vassalization. We waited for spring, certain of victory.
   1048695|00000000||Radovid? Submit?
   1048697|00000000||Yes. A vain hope, I agree. Radovid sent no peace envoys, nor did he advance on our positions. Instead, he trudged over the snow-bound Kestrel Mountains… and attacked Kaedwen, his ally.
   1048342|00000000||How's the war going?
   1041275|00000000||Any news from Novigrad? Is the free city still free?
   1048488|00000000||Yes, although everyone knows this won't last. Radovid is in Oxenfurt, and the emperor is here, in Vizima. At Novigrad's doorstep, both. And both require coin and ships. Novigrad can provide these.
   1048490|00000000||Which is why the mood in the city is rather… well, on edge.
   1048492|00000000||Meaning?
   1048494|00000000||How do men deal with fear? They seek reassurance… and scapegoats. The Church of the Eternal Fire understands this perfectly. And so it promises to improve the lives of its flock by pointing out the guilty.
   1048496|00000000||Who started the war? Who profits from it? Why, it's obvious - mages, elves, dwarves. In a word, any and all deviants.
   1048498|00000000||I've been stationed in Novigrad for thirteen years. First as a consul, then as ambassador. I've seen a great deal - cruelty, cynicism, greed. But what is happening there now concerns me greatly.
   1041259|00000000||What's new in Novigrad?
   1041283|00000000||What's new in Skellige?
   1048519|00000000||Nothing. The islanders pride themselves on that, don't they? Doing everything according to tradition? As their forefathers did.
   1048521|00000000||And like their forefathers, they quarrel with each other, pillage, occasionally attack our transports. This is cumbersome… but nothing more. Skellige has always been a footnote to history. And so it shall remain.
   1048523|00000000||Sound awfully confident. What if King Bran manages to unite the jarls? Lead all the clans against your fleet?
   1048525|00000000||King Bran is a feeble old man. From what I know he barely remembers the names of his own vassals. Uniting all might prove difficult.
   1041260|00000000||What's the latest from Skellige?
   1041293|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1048344|00000000||Think nothing of it. May the Great Sun light your Path.
   1041261|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1041258|00000000||What's the situation in Velen?
   1041263|00000000||Hm. How do things look in Velen?
   1041269|00000000||As bad as ever… perhaps worse.
   1041271|00000000||This land never flowed with milk and honey, and now it flows with blood. Armies have swept through it several times, trampling fields, looting granaries, burning villages. Famine grips the populace.
   1048476|00000000||Mhm. So how's ruling that earthly paradise going for you?
   1048481|00000000||Not well, to be honest. Our forces are spread thin as it is, and Velen is chiefly swampy forests that are difficult to control. We've had several patrols never return to their camps.
   1048483|00000000||Thus, we've temporarily delegated authority in this region to a certain Nordling, a former low-ranking officer in the Temerian army, one Phillip Strenger. Better known by his nom de guerre, the Bloody Baron.
   1048485|00000000||I advise you well - avoid him.
   1041253|00000000||Ambassador var Attre?
   1048334|00000000||Yennefer suggested I ask you about current events. The war, and so on.
   1048336|00000000||Of course. The emperor's servants should keep no secrets from each other. If you will, let us approach the map.
   1041257|00000000||Yes, Geralt? Something else?
   1041255|00000000||That is I. And you must be Geralt. The witcher known as the White Wolf… or alternatively, the Butcher of Blaviken.
   1048332|00000000||Geralt's fine, really.
   1077546|0aa7b54a||Guard
   1048536|00000000||That quill sharpened yet? Yes? Then transcribe.
   1048538|00000000||The true authority in Novigrad is not the city council or the merchant's guild, but the Church of the Eternal Fire and the criminal underworld.
   1048546|00000000||At times it is difficult to tell the one from the other. They both display a similar ruthlessness and cynicism that…
   1048548|00000000||Please wait, Your Excellency. I am falling behind.
   1048550|00000000||You know what? I'll write the report myself. You'll need only prepare a clean draft, in triplicate.
    420952|7643aa11||Servant
    569516|00000000||Forgive us, sir. We are occupied.
    569512|00000000||{Ess'va dearf?}[Are you certain?]
    570796|00000000||{Evelienn. Katte áth, tve gláeddyven. Essa vatt’ghern.}[Wholly. Cat eyes, two swords - a witcher.]
    569513|00000000||{Esse ma a strigean aep Foltest aen carnnan. } [Perhaps he's to clear the catacombs - strigas left over from Foltest's days.]
    569515|00000000||{Caen vyos? Ae'vyos que'ess imbael. Essa ssant. Ess'va Nordling.}[Perhaps. Who knows how many he sired. Lecherous, he was. Typical Nordling.]
    570811|00000000||{Allaidh. } [Barbarians.]
   1050605|00000000||{Esse clytie... Hyn vrae breinne gardd? } [These flower beds… they call this the royal garden?]
   1050607|00000000||{En celfyd daen garddvrae esse plenten aep Nord, marche. } [Seems the horticultural arts are still in their infancy in the North.]
   1050634|00000000||{En celfyd daen sychiad hefyd, cassve caen gvelede tu meve. } [The cleaning arts as well, judging by what I've seen inside.]
   1050609|00000000||{Ymherodr caisse hvandre slafie aep caer'den duges Vicovaro. Glaenne esse plasse.}[The emperor will soon bring in a hundred slaves from the duchess of Vicovaro's court. They'll tidy the palace up.]
   1050611|00000000||{Hvandr gallu esse nac'gvasse.}[A hundred might not suffice.]
   1050636|00000000||We've no need for the gentleman's escort.
   1055186|3a515643||Nilfgaardian Noblewoman
    571107|00000000||How might I serve the gentleman?
    571108|00000000||By returning my things.
    571110|00000000||Citrus and cloves. The fragrance will keep the gentleman's robes fresh somewhat longer.
    571468|00000000||Mhh. Thanks bunches.
   1047735|00000000||The emperor is not known for his patience. He wants his daughter back, safe and sound. As soon as possible.
   1047737|00000000||Yeah, mentioned something of the sort. So long.
    571470|00000000||May the Golden Sun shine upon you always.
   1069326|e0351e50||Treasure Chest
   1001508|00000000||We are done talking.
   1001510|00000000||I've given you your orders - they are clear.
   1001506|00000000||When I wish to speak to you, I shall have you summoned.
   1028795|00000000||Wouldn't mind a few rounds of cards.
   1086498|00000000||Gwent - play me.
    492362|00000000||See you.
    492353|00000000||See you.
    492349|00000000||Hm?
   1054906|cd8f7b8e||Ambassador var Attre
   1043973|00000000||Fine.
   1044089|00000000||Fine… then what? Gonna do my nails, too?
   1044091|00000000||If time permits. Sadly, the day is short, while the list of hygienic and cosmetic treatments that the gentleman should undergo is really rather long.
   1041386|00000000||I spared his life. He escaped.
   1041398|00000000||We fought on opposing sides, true. Then we landed in the same dungeon. Aryan escaped, set fire to the castle on his way out.
   1041400|00000000||Ahh, so that is how the blaze started. Our reports suggested the dragon was responsible.
   1041314|00000000||I joined Iorveth, he helped me out.
   1041374|00000000||I left Flotsam with Iorveth, commander of a Scoia'tael unit.
   1041376|00000000||A slayer of monsters and a slayer of men… you forge interesting alliances.
   1041324|00000000||Helped Roche rescue Anaïs.
   1041370|00000000||Not the way I see it. I helped a friend rescue a child.
   1041372|00000000||Anaïs was not just any child. She was a pawn in a game you did not understand. You and Roche did not rescue her at all. At most, you moved her from one edge of the board to the other, fanning the flames of conflict.
   1047296|00000000||Helped Iorveth lift the spell that held Saskia.
   1047299|00000000||Not at all. I meddled in a personal affair. Helped Iorveth lift the spell that held Saskia.
   1047301|00000000||Yes, and in doing so gave Radovid a reason to begin his witch hunts. Congratulations.
   1041334|00000000||Got what was coming to her.
   1041348|00000000||Huh, an old acquaintance, more like. Not so close that I felt bad for her, but close enough that I knew she deserved it.
   1041350|00000000||"He believes he alone knows what is good and what is evil, and that this gives him the right to dispense justice."
   1047303|00000000||Your comrade, Letho of Gulet, described you so. Quite accurate, I'd say.
   1044184|00000000||My comrade - your agent.
   1041346|00000000||That alliance still alive? What happened to Letho?
   1041352|00000000||That an ongoing alliance? What's Letho up to?
   1041354|00000000||I had hoped you would answer that question.
   1041356|00000000||Ah. So Letho's hiding from you. Must have a good reason. Was there a shift in national interest that might've caused that?
   1044186|00000000||I don't know where he is. Wouldn't tell you if I did, anyway. Blade or no blade to my throat.
   1047765|00000000||How goes it? Preparations for the audience proceeding as planned?
   1047767|00000000||Yes, general. The gentleman will be more or less presentable.
   1047769|00000000||Who's this guy? He a barber, too?
   1047771|00000000||No. Morvran Voorhis. Commander of the Alba Division. Yennefer's escort - they were my men, all of them.
   1047773|00000000||Indeed… "were," for none have returned to Vizima, have they? I truly wonder what happened on the road yesterday. Perhaps you could enlighten me? You have time… and a razor to your throat.
   1047787|00000000||Wild Hunt killed them.
   1047789|00000000||A cavalcade of wraiths dashing across the night sky? These omens of war the peasantry babbles about? Expect me to believe that?
   1047791|00000000||Frankly, I don't really give a damn.
   1047779|00000000||Wild Hunt killed them.
   1047778|00000000||Your men died in battle. As soldiers do.
   1047781|00000000||Your men died in battle. As soldiers tend to.
   1047783|00000000||I see their fate does not trouble you… overly.
   1047785|00000000||True. But I'm guessing the fate of those whose country they invaded didn't overly trouble them.
   1047802|00000000||Nordlings - ugh. We can bathe you, shave you and clothe you, but teaching you manners… that will be a challenge.
   1047804|00000000||Nice meeting you, too.
   1047806|00000000||Done. Shall I shave him once more, against the grain?
   1047808|00000000||No. He himself is very much against the grain - that's enough. Farewell, witcher. Or rather, see you soon.
    569662|00000000||Good. Now the gentleman may dress.
    569664|00000000||Sadly, I did not receive exact measurements. If the garments chafe, our tailor will adjust them.
    569386|00000000||Where're my clothes?
    569389|00000000||Where're my clothes?
    569674|00000000||Where they should have gone long ago. With the laundress.
    569676|00000000||They will be returned to you after the audience, clean and starched.
    569391|00000000||The gentleman will tell me once he has chosen an outfit.
    569387|00000000||Black, black… or black.
    569388|00000000||We do not like garish colors in Nilfgaard.
    569385|00000000||Any color, as long as it's black?
   1041358|00000000||I believe that is all. Your signature, please, affirming you stated the whole truth and nothing but the truth, on pain of imprisonment or death, et cetera, et cetera. Here… and here.
   1041362|00000000||With these formalities seen to, I would ask the general to leave the room. We shall be choosing the gentleman's attire. An important matter, but one that does not require the general's assistance.
   1041364|00000000||Shame… I might have given you some advice. So long, Geralt. Good luck with your audience.
   1044195|00000000||Feels more like I'm being readied for a wedding.
   1044202|00000000||Were that so, I would have prepared the gentleman a frock, a tailcoat, or possibly a dinner jacket. In point of fact, the gentleman will choose from these garments.
   1041366|00000000||Well, that alliance has been dissolved. Irrevocably. I killed Letho in Loc Muinne.
   1041368|00000000||So we heard. It's a good thing you did. Saved our agents some messy and difficult work.
   1041345|00000000||That alliance is dead. See, I killed Letho.
   1044191|00000000||Well, national interest calls on one to forge difficult alliances at times. Alliances with witchers included.
   1041336|00000000||I watched her get in the megascope, but ultimately freed her… from the trap your man Letho of Gulet had set. Write that down. I wanna be sure the paperwork's in order now.
   1041333|00000000||Síle escaped.
   1044122|00000000||Nilfgaard recently started a war. Unprovoked. So do us both a favor and stop moralizing.
   1044189|00000000||The gentleman must sit still. I am almost done.
   1044124|00000000||I'm afraid I might find that difficult. Because from what I know, shortly afterwards you watched a defective megascope blow your friend Síle de Tansarville to bits.
   1041326|00000000||The mighty had imprisoned Triss Merigold. Oughta know I care about her. And I tend to rescue those I care about.
   1041328|00000000||And so you did, handing Radovid control of the Conclave and Council of Mages in the process.
   1041323|00000000||Had to save Triss.
   1044114|00000000||Something tells me my most interesting is yet to come. Go on, next question - before my beard grows back in.
   1044116|00000000||We shall shave you again if it does. Very well. The infamous summit at Loc Muinne. You were there. And once again meddled in the affairs of the mighty.
   1041316|00000000||I got out of Flotsam with Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes and…
   1041318|00000000||…A murderer of nonhumans. We know this gentleman well, witcher. You forge interesting alliances.
   1041313|00000000||Got out of Flotsam with Vernon Roche.
   1044110|00000000||Moving on. You then found shelter in charming Flotsam, and from there made your way to Vergen. My question is - "how?"
   1041378|00000000||Foltest ordered me to clear the path. The boy stood in my way.
   1041380|00000000||Cutting down the la Valette heir - this made no impression on you? I suppose it wouldn't. What's some baron to an assassin of kings?
   1041385|00000000||I killed Aryan during the siege. Just happened that way.
   1044077|00000000||And prepare to answer some questions.
   1044079|00000000||General, I am not certain this is the appropriate time.
   1041390|00000000||I can't think of a better time. Men turn honest when they feel a blade at their throat.
   1047100|00000000||Morvran Voorhis, commander of the Alba Division. Before they take you in to see the emperor, witcher, there's some information I need you to verify. It's a formality, but one that must be seen to.
   1041392|00000000||Sure. Paperwork's gotta be in order.
   1044081|00000000||So, Geralt of Rivia. Place of birth - unknown, parents - unknown, age - unknown… All insignificant details. Let us proceed to more recent events - the siege of La Valette Castle. The fate of the defending commander, one Aryan.
   1041388|00000000||Tilt your head back, please. And sit still.
   1044083|00000000||What's wrong with my beard? Always thought it added to my dignity.
   1044085|00000000||It does. Yet it also detracts from your elegance. In Nilfgaard we consider beards hard on the eyes. Especially beards infested with lice.
   1044087|00000000||Been on the road a while. Fine, do your thing.
   1043972|00000000||Something wrong with my beard?
    569648|00000000||The gentleman will be seated on the bergère.
    569650|00000000||The what now?
    569652|00000000||In that… chair.
    569655|00000000||Cledwyn. Please shave the gentleman - sideburns to half an inch.
    569642|00000000||Hmm. It must suffice.
    569644|00000000||Think Emhyr cares if I'm clean?
    569646|00000000||The gentleman will refer to His Imperial Majesty by his full title or not at all.
    570205|00000000||Your Imperial Majesty.
    570207|00000000||{Areir aep tho orde... } [As Your Majesty wished…]
    570209|00000000||{Evelienn namyn vatt’ghern va vort.}[All except the witcher will leave.]
    570185|00000000||[Don't bow.]
    570333|00000000||I thought you bowed before no man.
    570335|00000000||Didn't want to disappoint the chamberlain. We're friends.
    566880|00000000||Only doing this for Ciri.
    566901|00000000||Save your generosity for those whose homes your armies have razed.
    566903|00000000||I'll do it for Ciri. Not for your gold.
    566905|00000000||Your motives do not interest me. Only results.
   1047320|00000000||Yennefer will tell you the rest.
    566899|00000000||This audience is finished. Mererid!
    570367|00000000||Take him to the sorceress.
    577657|00000000||I need information, not motivation. Ciri… leaves few tracks. She'll be hard to find.
    577674|00000000||My corps of spies will help you. Count on them, and my army, should the need arise.
    566878|00000000||Need information, not motivation.
    566888|00000000||How many men in your army? Twenty thousand? Thirty?
    577718|00000000||So why me?
   1044571|00000000||You know why. Because she trusts you.
    577410|00000000||She trusts me, yes. So tell me why you're looking for her. Doubt it's about making up for all those lost years.
    577412|00000000||For reasons of state. As always.
   1047316|00000000||Enough of this banter. You will agree regardless.
   1047318|00000000||If for no other reason than because I shall pay you. More than you customarily receive for a contract. Considerably more.
    577209|00000000||Why me?
    577210|00000000||She's back? You're sure?
    577321|00000000||Are you sure? Ciri… left. Went far, far away.
    577417|00000000||Do you believe I'd drag you here in the middle of a war to discuss a rumor?
    577709|00000000||I think anyone can be wrong, even an emperor.
   1047312|00000000||I had forgotten how insolent you can be.
   1047314|00000000||I haven't the time to convince you, nor the desire, in fact. Yennefer will do that - after the audience.
    566763|00000000||Take it you didn't summon me to reminisce about the good old days, so…
    566770|00000000||Silence.
    566784|00000000||My daughter Cirilla… she's returned, and she's in danger. The Wild Hunt pursues her.
    577208|00000000||You will find her and bring her to me.
    570337|00000000||So many months at Foltest's court… yet you still haven't mastered the basics of etiquette.
    570339|00000000||Know what they say - can't teach an old wolf new tricks?
    570184|00000000||[Bow.]
    570177|00000000||{Ym'grymie aep Aard Ker'zaer, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd, Emhyr var Emreis!}[Bow before His Imperial Majesty, The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes, Emhyr var Emreis!]
    570180|00000000||Bow.
    582353|00000000||Pardon, my lord. I was sure I wouldn't--
    582355|00000000||Do you know who I am?
    582357|00000000||Yes.
    582359|00000000||Emhyr var Emreis, emperor of Nilfgaard, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes.
    582361|00000000||You are Foltest's servant?
    582363|00000000||I was, aye… D-do you really do it?
    582365|00000000||Do what?
    582367|00000000||Dance on your enemies' graves?
    582369|00000000||{Guards!
    582351|00000000||No one's ever asked me that.
    582405|00000000||{Gàrracaer ess mëot leeg caer. } [The garden was to be empty.]
    582407|00000000||{A'ess, Aard Ker'zaer. N'evellien am caed…} [It was, Your Imperial Majesty. No one was to…]
    582410|00000000||Have mercy, my lord. Merely looking after the tree. Thought no one would--
    582412|00000000||Silence, Temerian. Don't speak until spoken to.
    582414|00000000||{Ax. } [Axe.]
    582416|00000000||Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.
    582418|00000000||This is Temeria no more. Not the garden, not the palace, not the country. It's Nilfgaard now.
    582420|00000000||Aye, Nilfgaard, so be it. Been caring for the tree since the days of Medell, Foltest's father.
    582422|00000000||Do you know how Foltest died?
    582426|00000000||Murdered in La Valette Castle.
    582428|00000000||Where was your royal guard at the time?
    582430|00000000||King was alone. They say… say the assassin caught him in the solar.
    582434|00000000||Solitude, yes. It can be a deadly trap when one is not attentive.
   1002205|b352eb18||Nilfgaardian Courtier
    569510|00000000||{Vissean ess'va aen Novigrad?}[Have the envoys returned from Novigrad?]
    569511|00000000||{Yeá… An neen. Raadsliden ae'enect, es Tunn esse saor an neenphàir.}[Yes, empty-handed. The ealdormen decreed the city shall remain independent and neutral.]
    569998|00000000||{Esse'sidh avside aep feansa neen math theenk. Neen cofhurtail an ennv pa vall. } [Straddling the fence - foolish idea. Not only uncomfortable, but one is liable to fall.]

    570001|00000000||{Dùth. Visse var Attre ess pa'as aep.}[The right one. Ambassador var Attre will make certain.]
    570030|00000000||Always worth trying.
    570054|00000000||Still worth trying.
    570056|00000000||Because?
    570122|00000000||Because there are few causes worth serving. Even fewer men.
    570124|00000000||Enough about that. Mind if we change the subject?
    570048|00000000||Know a thing or two about that.
    570050|00000000||Care to explain?
    570052|00000000||Never changes. I try to stay out of things, stand aside… then comes an urgent summons and an offer I can't refuse.
    570029|00000000||Know a bit about that…
    575870|00000000||{Tedd a'taeghane, en'ca land n'ees a evelloë saor. Aep Toussaint…}[These days it's unwise for small realms to remain fully independent. Take Toussaint…]
    569522|00000000||Mind if I interrupt?
    570024|00000000||Why not join in instead?
    570026|00000000||We're discussing neutrality. How difficult it is to preserve.
    570028|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
    570120|00000000||Talked to the emperor.
    570139|00000000||So, talked to the emperor.
    570141|00000000||Hm. Why did he summon you?
    570143|00000000||So not even you know.
    570146|00000000||No. But I wager it's an ordinary witchers' contract.
    570148|00000000||Mhm. Some werebbubbs.
    570062|00000000||Farewell.
    570058|00000000||See you.
    570060|00000000||Soon, mind you.
   1055163|e128b05b||Nilfgaardian Nobleman
   1047371|00000000||Yeah… all grown up.
   1047420|00000000||How about that… she's grown up.
   1047422|00000000||It's been years since you trained together at Kaer Morhen.
   1058728|00000000||A great deal has changed.
   1049513|00000000||You haven't. Not a bit.
   1049515|00000000||I missed those awkward compliments of yours…
   1058726|00000000||But let's focus on Ciri, all right?
   1047689|00000000||Guess this means we need to split up again. Not my preference, but I understand. Clock's ticking.
   1047710|00000000||It is indeed. So, why don't I teleport you to Velen, get you there at once?
   1047712|00000000||Not gonna happen. I'll go on horseback. Soon as I can get changed.
   1047714|00000000||Have it your way. Oh, and… you really look quite dashing in black velvet.
   1047716|00000000||Think so? Maybe I can have some of my armor lined with it. Hm. Good luck, Yen.
   1047722|00000000||Same to you. And if you wish to learn what's happened in the world while you and Vesemir roamed the wilderness, talk to Ambassador var Attre. That's him, over there.
   1049543|00000000||And Geralt, I know it's wartime, but try not to be a hero, all right? Just check those leads and come back to me - in one piece.
   1065014|00000000||I shall be waiting.
   1047686|00000000||Time to get going.
   1047687|00000000||Before we part… why didn't you contact me earlier?
   1047691|00000000||One thing before we go… Why didn't you contact me? Didn't need me, didn't even want to see me?
   1047693|00000000||I didn't want to spoil things. I'd heard you and Triss made a great couple.
   1047704|00000000||Yen… I'd lost my memory.
   1048306|00000000||Really - that's your excuse?
   1047706|00000000||Let's drop it, all right? "It's not what you think" or "it helped me understand how much I love you" - I don't wish to hear it, any of it.
   1047652|00000000||So where's Ciri been seen, exactly?
   1047654|00000000||In two places - Velen and Novigrad.
   1047656|00000000||The trail in Velen is most promising. You should make that your first stop. Ask for a merchant named Hendrik at the Inn at the Crossroads. One of the emperor's agents, he should get in touch with you.
   1047658|00000000||That's it? No passwords, secret handshakes?
   1047660|00000000||None. Sorry to spoil your fun, your boyhood fantasies about the crafts of the trade.
   1047662|00000000||All we have in Novigrad are unconfirmed reports, rumors. But there you will have the help of our mutual acquaintance.
   1058730|00000000||Triss Merigold. Apparently she's got a cozy flat on the main square.
   1047664|00000000||Sure she'll be delighted to see me. What about you? What will you do?
   1047666|00000000||I shall sail for Skellige. There was a magic explosion there recently, blew half a forest down. I believe this had something to do with Ciri. I'll be in Kaer Trolde. Join me there once you've learned something.
   1047626|00000000||So where's Ciri been seen?
   1047435|00000000||What's the Wild Hunt want from Ciri?
   1047628|00000000||The Wild Hunt - what could it want from Ciri?
   1047630|00000000||I've no clue, Geralt. Might've written them to ask, but I don't have their address.
   1047635|00000000||I know as much as you do. It must be about her blood, her gift.
   1047638|00000000||As for what the Hunt wishes to do with that gift, I-- I'd prefer not to think about it, really.
   1047432|00000000||Right. Emhyr said the Wild Hunt's after her. I'd find that hard to believe - before what happened yesterday. How did they track us down?
   1047440|00000000||Because of me. You see… I've spent months searching for Ciri. Using locating spells, haruspicy, geomancy, anything, really. I knew the Wild Hunt might sense it, perhaps even find me, but… I thought I'd tricked them.
   1047442|00000000||Well, guess you were wrong.
   1047623|00000000||Hm. I've sensed them on my trail, hunting me, for some time. If not for you and Emhyr's soldiers, they'd have gotten what they were after.
   1049521|00000000||I can't risk another encounter like that. It's time to put away the magic, turn to more traditional methods… to the best tracker I know.
   1049529|00000000||You must find her, Geralt. Before the Wild Hunt does.
   1047373|00000000||Hm, so they're "our" agents now? My, my… you've clearly settled in quick.
   1047375|00000000||Geralt, don't twist my words.
   1047418|00000000||I know who Emhyr is. He started this war and its bloodshed. He had my friends killed. But I haven't any other choice, so please… let's not belabor the pros and cons and instead focus on finding Ciri. All right?
   1047370|00000000||So they're our agents now?
   1047264|00000000||Geralt! That tunic - you look positively smashing.
   1047358|00000000||Ugh, dying to take it off.
   1049500|00000000||I'd consider that a proposition under different circumstances… one I might even take you up on. But we've matters to attend to.
   1047361|00000000||Now do you understand why I'm at Emhyr's court?
   1047363|00000000||Mhm. And seems we're in the same boat, now.
   1047366|00000000||Ciri - she's really back? No chance he's mistaken?
   1047368|00000000||Look - that's more or less what she looks like now, or so our agents claim. Our little witcher's grown into a young lady.
    569369|00000000||This is the place.
    454415|00000000||Once we enter, there'll be no returning until we reach Ge'els. Ready?
    584738|00000000||A portal, here?
    584744|00000000||A portal, here?
    586024|00000000||This passage has existed since the Conjunction of Spheres. It will continue to exist, opening periodically, long after you all die.
    584746|00000000||Several centuries ago a temple dedicated to the moon stood here. Even earlier, there was a circle of monoliths. Now there is a city on this spot.
    584748|00000000||You build upon the ruins of hallowed places, upon intersections of the Power. And then you forget why. The ancient magic of these sites persists regardless.
   1009438|00000000||Is that sufficient, does it satisfy your curiosity? Ready now?
    454417|00000000||Let's go.
    454421|00000000||Yes, let's go.
    536464|00000000||Remember, wherever you land, search for a place that looks like this one. We shall meet, sooner or later.
    536466|00000000||Mean we'll be separated?
    584740|00000000||It's possible. I lack your ward's talent. Zireael is the Lady of Time and Space, I merely know how to use this arcane knowledge to a limited degree.
    584753|00000000||It's time.
   1063659|00000000||I hate portals.
   1024688|00000000||The passage is here, past this wall.
    536475|00000000||Wait for me a minute.
    454425|00000000||I remind you we have a job to do. Hurry.
   1027690|00000000||There it is.
    569851|00000000||The gentleman will address the emperor only when asked to and using the appropriate title.
    569478|00000000||Your Archmagnificency?
    569479|00000000||I see the gentleman is in the mood for jests. I fear the emperor might not share his disposition.
   1047305|00000000||"Your Majesty" will suffice. Spoken loudly, clearly and with respect.
    569856|00000000||Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd - that is our most gracious ruler's full title.
    569858|00000000||But the emperor dislikes hearing our language butchered. In the gentleman's case, "Your Majesty" must suffice.
    569773|00000000||Hmm. A touch tight in the waist… but it will do.
    569771|00000000||And they say clothes do not make the man.
    569404|00000000||I'm not a boor. I know how to bow.
    569407|00000000||I'm not some boor. I know how to bow.
    569408|00000000||Please, demonstrate.
    569763|00000000||That, sir, is how you might bow to a whore on a street corner, not to the emperor of Nilfgaard.
    569472|00000000||This is absurd.
    569473|00000000||Gotta be kidding.
    569474|00000000||Not at all. I am mortally serious.
    569843|00000000||Does the gentleman know the penalty for breaches of etiquette in the emperor's presence? Two hundred lashes.
    569845|00000000||I do not wish that upon him, so I will not let him leave until I am confident that he knows how to behave.
    569468|00000000||Hmm, lacking fluidity and grace. But we've learned to expect less of Nordlings.
    569469|00000000||Come with me.
    569459|00000000||[Left leg forward, right hand on chest.]
    569465|00000000||Please, this is neither the time nor the place for such antics.
    569836|00000000||The gentleman will watch carefully.
    569461|00000000||[Left leg back, hands at the side.]
    569460|00000000||[Right leg forward, left hand on chest.]
    569463|00000000||Wrong, wrong, wrong.
    569832|00000000||Once more.
    569470|00000000||Leg extended, hand flat, head down, chin to chest.
    569471|00000000||The gentleman will rehearse.
    569451|00000000||Please watch.
    569405|00000000||Confirm away.
    569403|00000000||Confirm away.
    569397|00000000||A studded doublet and a sword on my back - that's what would satisfy me. But tough, when in Nilfgaard…
    569751|00000000||Yes…?
    569753|00000000||It's a saying. So what now? Powder my nose?
    569755|00000000||No need. The gentleman's complexion is light enough.
    569757|00000000||The gentleman is to stand before the Ruler of the North and South. I must confirm that he knows how to bow.
    569393|00000000||Suppose so.
    569395|00000000||Rather try on something else.
    569396|00000000||Go ahead. We've time.
    569394|00000000||Lemme try on something else.
    569775|00000000||Does the outfit satisfy the gentleman?
    569769|00000000||Black suits the gentleman.
    569686|00000000||This might come as news to the gentleman, but a towel wrapped around one's waist is not fitting attire for an audience.
    569767|00000000||The gentleman will kindly dress.
    578772|00000000||I believe the gentleman's forgetting something?
