   1040088|00000000||I was wondering how long it would take you, Geralt.
   1041871|00000000||I'm upstairs. Don't be shy.
   1040092|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1041934|00000000||Well, well. Nice.
   1060296|00000000||Gotta be prepared to make sacrifices.
   1060298|00000000||Well… some causes require a sacrifice.
   1060300|00000000||Causes… what about people?
   1060302|00000000||For people… same holds true.
   1060304|00000000||So maybe you'd care to dive in after that sack for me?
   1060306|00000000||You win.
    501304|00000000||Stop… Hear that…? They've come for us.
    501305|00000000||The fool didn't break until I began to prick his heels.
    501306|00000000||Every man's got his sensitive spots. Interrogated a mage once, pain couldn't touch him. Tore off his fingernails, crushed his bollocks… Nothing.
    501510|00000000||Turned out he was devilishly ticklish. I placed a beetle on his belly and set a mug atop it. Damn near went mad.
    501307|00000000||We were lucky this time, but… you'd best leave via the sewers. The trap door's in the floor.
    501308|00000000||Take care of yourself, Kluhg.
    490551|00000000||I can do that. Where'd you toss the package?
    490552|00000000||Near the crane. Second bridge in from the harbor.
    490553|00000000||I didn't expect such devotion.
    499761|00000000||Wanted to freshen up anyway. Let's go.
   1060295|00000000||I'll get it.
    490545|00000000||Hello, Kluhg. Manage to get those magic incense ingredients?
    490546|00000000||Yes… somewhat with, uh, difficulties, you might say. I was walking along the canal with a sack full of goodies for you. Looked up and spied a trio of Temple Guards coming the other way.
    499759|00000000||Get to the point, Kluhg. No time today for one of your long stories.
    492471|00000000||Wait! A sack full of magicalities and they were coming straight towards me! I don't easily frighten, but, uh, I felt a cold sweat on my arse, I did.
    509927|00000000||I'm afraid I had no choice. I dropped the sack in the water - I had to! When asked why, I claimed it contained a dead cat. You shan't believe this, but they believed me!
    490547|00000000||I need that package, Kluhg. I've got a contract.
    490548|00000000||It must be on the canal bed. Luckily it was heavy enough to sink. I'm sure it will turn up if you search.
    490549|00000000||You expect me to pay you, then dive for my goods into that ice-cold filth?
    504650|00000000||Yn all’an daonna ar ais…
   1052051|00000000||Pretty grim place.
   1052053|00000000||Place is pretty grim.
   1052055|00000000||True, it looks like a vampire's hideout. Which is why we can be pretty sure no one'll bother us here.
   1052057|00000000||Give me the figurine and stand back.
   1074442|00000000||{Ver d’eer! En zer Ker'zaer! } [For Honor! For The Emperor!]
   1016307|00000000||{Woh erre sinde? Waen iche hene? } [Who are you? What am I doing here?]
   1072311|00000000||{Esse pund… } [I am going to vomit…]
   1072313|00000000||Last thing you remember?
   1072315|00000000||Who are you? What's the last thing you remember?
   1072317|00000000||I remember a hill… a battle. I had orders, for a unit… I remember a sorceress, her hair likes flames… She cast a spell.
   1072319|00000000||The right flank was to attack, hit the shield bearers.
   1072321|00000000||The right flank didn't attack. And the sorceress was Lytta Neyd, known also as Coral. I was there, too… This… this happened long ago.
   1072323|00000000||{Sheyssere. } [Shit.]
   1072312|00000000||Rest.
   1072325|00000000||You're exhausted. Always happens with compression. Get some rest.
   1072331|00000000||Yes, I should.
   1072327|00000000||Once you've recovered a bit, you should find Ambassador var Attre. He's sure to help.
   1072329|00000000||Good luck.
   1031846|00000000||That was… interesting.
   1031847|00000000||And exhausting. Ugh, to fall onto a featherbed and sleep till… well, till I woke.
   1053802|00000000||I've got another figurine.
   1052059|00000000||Everything's ready. Let's get to work.
   1052021|00000000||Let's lift the nobleman's spell.
    477617|00000000||Let's try it. Think it's a nobleman…
    477672|00000000||Be on your guard. It could be something far more dangerous.
   1083314|00000000||Figurines - let's decompress one.
   1083315|00000000||Pretty grim place.
   1052020|00000000||Let's decompress the soldier.
   1051588|00000000||Let's try to decompress this one. Anything I can do to help?
   1051590|00000000||Yes. Be quiet and try not to disturb me.
    477687|00000000||Heu-geh! No! Coral, nooo! I-I can explain everything! Akh akh akh…
    477688|00000000||Coral?
    477689|00000000||I never looked at the lass… you are my one and only!
    477690|00000000||Oooh… You're not Coral. Some succubus, a delusion… Where am I?
    504750|00000000||Ah, so Coral put the spell on him.
    504769|00000000||So Coral enchanted him. Just like her.
    504778|00000000||If there's a more vindictive sorceress, I don't know her. Well, except maybe…
    504780|00000000||Coral's not here? In that case… come to me, succubus.
    504749|00000000||What's your name?
    504752|00000000||What is your name?
    504763|00000000||Mmm?
    504764|00000000||We're in Novigrad. No-vi-grad.
   1051580|00000000||In Novigrad? Last I recall, I was in Oxenfurt and Coral was furious. How can she demand fidelity when she herself is wanton as… as…
   1051582|00000000||As youthful goats.
   1051584|00000000||Exactly. Dammit, I feel as if I've been trampled by a herd of cattle. I've no notion what she did to me, but it seems you've delivered me from my misfortune.
   1051586|00000000||Here, take this. Have a good time, paint the town coral.
    504802|00000000||Whose taste has grown worse since you were sleeping with her. Come on, the kind-hearted gentleman'll get along fine on his own.
   1051592|00000000||Yn all’an daonna ar ais…
    477715|00000000||Truce! Truce! Lay down your arms!
    410068|00000000||Lemme pass.
    410086|00000000||Believe me, doing you a big favor by not giving you coin. Now lemme through.
    410088|00000000||Whoa! Master! You'd best watch your words! We share a trade, but that don't mean you can treat us like dogs!
   1049909|00000000||Sh-shut it! You'll bring misfortune on us. He's a witcher, can't you see?
    360934|00000000||Time you went home.
    360942|00000000||You boys look tired. Probably oughta go home now.
    360944|00000000||Well… How long we been drinkin' now?
    360946|00000000||Two days. Well said, master. Ahome we will go.
    360948|00000000||You're tired, go home.
    360958|00000000||Outta my way.
    410106|00000000||We won't do it!
   1049905|00000000||I will…
   1049907|00000000||I'll not take orders from anyone! In fact, not the least afeared to teach a witcher some manners!
    360950|00000000||Fuck off.
    360952|00000000||Fine. I'll help.
    410098|00000000||Calm down, don't want any trouble. Here, drink yourselves dumb.
    360938|00000000||That's what I call loyalty to the guild! Thank you, master! We'll knock one back in your honor!
    410100|00000000||Fine, take this.
    360930|00000000||Fine. I'll help.
    360904|00000000||Help some fellers out, master? We're a bit o' coin short another round.
    360906|00000000||Cause we're comrades, see? Witcher, ain't you? We're butchers! You slaughter, we slaughter!
    410048|00000000||Cept witchers earn more. Whole villages pitch in, lords open their purses, ladies do like with their legs!
    360908|00000000||Guess I been to the wrong villages, dealt with the wrong lords and ladies.
    360910|00000000||C'mon, don't make us beg! What's a witcher for, anyways? You're to help men in need.
    426848|00000000||I need work.
    426850|00000000||What can you do?
    426852|00000000||Good with a sword. Wouldn't scoff at working as protection.
    426854|00000000||And who here would you protect?
   1066328|00000000||Not your hireling. Won't take your orders, don't need your advice.
   1066330|00000000||You're not my hireling, that's true. But soooo uppity, afraid you need to die. Kill him!
   1066325|00000000||Don't need your advice.
   1066332|00000000||Fine. All in all, don't really care who I'm gonna protect. Just looking for work.
   1066326|00000000||Forget I said anything.
    369970|00000000||Whoreson Junior's made a load of enemies, I know that much. Maybe I can be of use.
    369972|00000000||Junior can take care of himself, you needn't fret about him.
    453397|00000000||But I can't help wonder how you know this place belongs to him.
   1066322|00000000||Heard it does, that's all.
   1066324|00000000||Forget you heard of Junior, keep healthy. That's my advice.
    369968|00000000||How about Whoreson Junior?
    369966|00000000||Someone's gotta keep folk in check.
    369978|00000000||Crowds can spin out of control. Somebody's gotta keep the peace.
    453465|00000000||Hm…
    439944|00000000||Claim any kind of experience?
    453435|00000000||I'm a witcher. I kill monsters for coin. Been doing it all my life. Humans won't be a problem.
    453437|00000000||A guard must fight sometimes. But that's not most important.
    453439|00000000||The essential question is, can you control yourself? And can you control a crowd?
    453441|00000000||Been taught how to slow down or speed up my heart rate, how to dilate my pupils and alter my metabolism.
    453443|00000000||My medallion vibrates when danger's near, and I know a few simple spells.
    453431|00000000||Monsters, I kill them.
    453433|00000000||Done my share of fighting.
    453445|00000000||Done my share of fighting. Wouldn't carry a sword if I didn't know how to use it.
    453447|00000000||Have you killed humans?
    453449|00000000||Sometimes.
    453451|00000000||Why not come out and say you're a witcher? It's plain to see.
    453453|00000000||Not looking for any monster contracts. Need a regular job. For a while.
    453481|00000000||Hmm… I'll have to test you. I want to see how you manage in a fight, if you can fight at all.
    453483|00000000||You shall fight in the arena. Survive three bouts, and I'll put you to work.
    405150|00000000||Ready? Wish to enter the arena?
    404842|00000000||Always prepared.
    404844|00000000||Excellent! Let's see what you're worth.
    407702|00000000||Remember, you fight to the death. The crowd doesn’t take kindly to those who spare their foes.
    404846|00000000||Let's do this.
    404836|00000000||I'm ready.
    404848|00000000||Need a moment to get ready.
    407704|00000000||Don't keep me waiting.
    404838|00000000||Not yet.
    366955|00000000||Set me up.
    366957|00000000||Already have.
    404834|00000000||Shall we start right away, or do you need time to prepare?
    366951|00000000||All right.
    366961|00000000||Not about to slaughter people I don't even know.
    366963|00000000||No work in protection until I've made sure you are who you say you are. You know where to find me should you change your mind.
    366953|00000000||No thanks.
    366965|00000000||So, decided yet? Willing to test your mettle in the arena?
   1003722|00000000||What a jackass.
   1003723|00000000||We weren't supposed to draw any attention.
   1003816|00000000||What? Nothing happened.
   1075638|8552a100||Bodyguard
   1054290|00000000||Long live Geralt of Rivia! Our savior!
    332443|002e3ae9||Book
    384180|00000000||Watch what you say. She's quick to ire, apt to take revenge.
    173990|00000000||Wants to show me something more.
   1074070|00000000||We must concentrate and lift the curse. Chat later.
   1030460|00000000||Ahh, no glass tastes as sweet as the first back in port.
   1030462|00000000||Taste of salted cod don't leave me till after the tenth. Or thirtieth.
   1030464|00000000||I'm happy enough to be drinkin' at all.
   1030466|00000000||True. But a hair's breadth and those Skellige barbarians would've had us.
    466292|c02c3cd2||Guard
   1069326|e0351e50||Treasure Chest
   1033616|00000000||That ain't real fire…
   1033618|00000000||Nuh-huh! It is too!
   1033619|00000000||They just smear ash on their lips first, that's why it don't hurt.
   1033622|00000000||That's all it takes? Ash?
   1033624|00000000||Uhhh… No, soap, too. We can try it at home later.
   1033626|00000000||Nice!
    548171|00000000||Kept running… till he bled to death.
    548172|00000000||Clear trail. Bled heavily…
   1034395|00000000||Something stinks… Decomposing flesh. Human flesh.
   1034870|00000000||A letter.
    548170|00000000||Sword wound. Shallow, but severed his artery. What're you holding? A key… Interesting.
    497112|00000000||Starting to look like a man serious about his business.
    497127|00000000||Seems Dandelion's taking the tavern business seriously.
    497136|00000000||If ye only knew. Gives it everythin'. Not seen him this obsessed ever.
    497170|00000000||That could help.
    497197|00000000||Hmm… Not a bad idea. Dandelion's pretty loose-lipped, might've blabbed something to a lady friend that'll put us on his trail…
    497206|00000000||That's what I'm countin' on.
    497211|00000000||Hm… We should divide these somehow… Perhaps… Ah, fuck it.
    497213|00000000||I'll ask the lasses on my half, you interrogate the ones on yours. Suit you?
    497248|00000000||Zoltan, wait. This is in verse.
    497251|00000000||And you figure that's unnatural because…?
    497253|00000000||Wonderful. Meet me back here when you're done. Share our findings…
   1071048|00000000||Right y'are. Need to do a wee bit o' tidyin' 'fore I go, can't stomach the idea of comin' back to this mess. And you'd be wise to read your bit 'fore you scurry off.
   1071050|00000000||If ye need anythin', I'll be next door.
    497171|00000000||Zoltan, please. You really wanna track down the women Dandelion's been wooing? Most likely all angry women by now.
    497195|00000000||Got any better ideas? 'Sides, Dandelion's a babbler. They're sure to know somethin' of his doin's.
    497169|00000000||Not interested in his romantic outings.
    497137|00000000||Seems when he inherited this fine establishment, it came with some fine responsibilities. Bookkeeping among 'em.
    497144|00000000||He also made a habit of notin' down the times of his meetings - official and private. So, who'd he been seein' of late…?
    497150|00000000||Ah! Here it is! Hmm, seems he's only been meetin' women of late, the dog.
    497115|00000000||Hah, Dandelion and planning? Good one.
    497126|00000000||Besides, anything he wrote here - probably had a special system, chaos only he could ever decipher. Actually, in the past, sometimes not even that.
    497130|00000000||Give 'im a chance, might not be that bad.
    497111|00000000||That's rich - Dandelion and planning?
    491734|00000000||Hmm… Ten barrels of Toussaint dry, five cases of Sodden triple mead… Hmm - nothing here.
    491759|00000000||No, no, no! That's exactly what we're lookin' for!
    497098|00000000||It's his planner.
   1051941|00000000||Sophie, listen. So I'm walkin' home from the tavern yesterday, cuttin' through the woods. It's dark, silent… Suddenly I hear footsteps.
   1051943|00000000||I start walkin' faster, and so does he… I stop, so does he. I turn around and look…
   1051945|00000000||A monster's standin' in the road. Face stitched up, pale as a corpse! He looked at me… and I grew cold as if I were long in the grave!
   1051947|00000000||What happened then?
   1051949|00000000||Well, I don't rightly know… I awoke in the morn in me own hut…
   1051951|00000000||Drink less, you'll stop havin' nightmares.
    580242|00000000||Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to our closed gwent tournament. By "closed" I mean more than the mere elite nature of the event.
   1014849|00000000||Anyone leaving the Passiflora before the end of play will be disqualified. That's rule number one.
   1014851|00000000||Rules number two, three and four are: no fighting, dirty play or magic tricks.
   1010348|00000000||We play for golden figurines. The winner will take them all, along with a monetary prize equal to nine times the buy-in.
    581169|00000000||Easy enough to calculate that nine have entered. The tournament will consist of three rounds. The finalist emerging from said shall play me.
    581180|00000000||Players will be paired by random draw. The groupings for the first round shall be read now.
    581181|00000000||Achoo! Finneas and Tim Knott.
    584605|00000000||Patrick Hazelnutt and Harald Featherbuns.
    581184|00000000||Gervalt of Rivia and Bernard Tulle.
    581186|00000000||Hah, how about that!
    581191|00000000||Bramble Fruntenstroch and - achoo! - Madame Sasha.
    581192|00000000||Excellent.
    581197|00000000||A pleasant match to you all!
    509928|00000000||Have you tried the quail baked in cranberry?
    509925|00000000||No more… I couldn't possibly take another bite.
    509929|00000000||Eat, eat - you know children are starving in Velen.
   1000557|00000000||She wore a turkey mask to the last ball, can you imagine?
   1000561|00000000||Pfff. Her mother says the girl has a singular sense of humor.
   1000563|00000000||If you ask me, she's batty, simple as that.
    509912|00000000||Stuffed peacock tongues… ugh, they inevitably give me gas.
    509914|00000000||Eat up, dear. No one will notice in this crowd.
    586129|00000000||I'm looking for Jad Karadin.
   1037211|00000000||And just who the hell're you?
   1037212|00000000||A friend of a friend. I'm looking for Karadin, thought maybe we could make some sort of deal.
   1039230|00000000||What, our business rubbin' some Novigrad pricks the wrong way? Ploughin' guilds!
    586131|00000000||C'mon! What ye waitin' for? Kill the fucker!
    586125|00000000||Jad Karadin - where is he?
    586126|00000000||You were in Karadin's band.
   1037248|00000000||Heard you were in Karadin's band.
   1037250|00000000||Fuckin' say what you want. C'mon, spit it out, you arselickin' bastard!
   1016717|00000000||Gods of the sea, I've never begrudged ye no gifts. Grant me another victory, so I can make ye another offerin' of me loot.
   1018043|00000000||Don't mind me.
   1037214|00000000||Fuck, what now?
   1076839|00000000||Look for me stall by the bridge 'cross the Pontar. Got goods for the army, mostly… but I'll make an exception for you!
    165978|e1e1c9c8||Thief
    416357|00000000||Even the women weren't spared…
    473712|00000000||I step in the hut, and there's the bumpkin with what looks like his son. Lad's on the pretty side, I think to meself.
    473524|00000000||Hayseed probably disguised his daughter, heheh.
    474709|00000000||Whoresons always manage to hide their lasses.
    473714|00000000||Thought he'd outsmarted me, the arsewipe.
    473716|00000000||Mean he hadn't?
    473718|00000000||I ploughed the snot outta that little shit - lad, lass, whatever the fuck it was.
    473526|00000000||Haha! Must've surprised the old coot. Bet he wet hisself! Heheh.
   1016204|00000000||Hm, drops of blood… Had my doubts…
    472395|00000000||But which mare is it? Hm, maybe it won't matter…
    400617|00000000||King's a long way away, and your pay's probably meager. Sure we can't make a deal?
    400619|00000000||Mean to say you're lookin' to uh - ahem - purchase a one-time pass?
    475659|00000000||Exactly.
    475661|00000000||Ah, that's a whole other conversation. Way's clear.
    400640|00000000||Maybe we can make a deal.
    401071|00000000||Let these people pass.
    408988|00000000||Yes, sir.
    400644|00000000||They're refugees - let 'em pass.
    401015|00000000||Let 'em through, before I get angry.
    408986|00000000||Huh? That a threat?
    475669|00000000||You'll not talk to me that way, oh no! We're done! Get 'im!
    408984|00000000||Let 'em pass, if you know what's good for you.
    400539|00000000||You need to go back.
    400613|00000000||Sorry, can't get involved. You're on your own.
    400615|00000000||Master, sir!
    400702|00000000||Enough! Gather up and go! Scram!
    400646|00000000||You're on your own.
    400609|00000000||They seem desperate. Let 'em through. Can't see any harm in it.
    475653|00000000||Fuckin' hell, 'ow many times have I gotta repeat this - I've orders to turn back anyone who don't show a pass!
    400537|00000000||Let them through.
    400603|00000000||Another one? Run along home with the rest.
    400605|00000000||Sir, show some mercy! We've not got nowhere to go. For us, it's Novigrad or death.
    400607|00000000||Had enough of you lot! Sod off! Or I'll have you skewered!
   1065189|00000000||Away go witchygo. Shoeses pick me.
   1066303|00000000||You even need shoes?
   1066305|00000000||Shoeses on humanses, shoeses wants Ogg, Pogg and Rogg.
   1066307|00000000||Biglords trollers be, like humanses.
   1066300|00000000||What use does a troll have for shoes?
   1066282|00000000||So long.
   1066235|00000000||Farewell.
   1066234|00000000||Now, now. Shoes aren't mushrooms. Tell the truth.
   1066260|00000000||Shoes don't sprout from the ground. You see who left them behind here?
   1066262|00000000||Hmm… Hmm… Speakno Rogg. Or angergets Ogg and Pogg.
   1066295|00000000||Ogg and Pogg - those your friends?

   1066226|00000000||Greetings.
   1066256|00000000||I can see that. Just wondering how those shoeses wound up here.

    392010|00000000||I just wanna talk to Johnny. He could know more than you.
    420370|00000000||…Not gonna hurt 'im, right? 'Cause… he's real, he's not made up.
    420372|00000000||I'm not gonna hurt him.
    392012|00000000||Johnny used to be by, 'cause Gran liked listenin' to his songs. When we was pickin' mushrooms, Johnny said he saw a girl with ashen hair in the swamp.
    392014|00000000||Where can I find Johnny?
    416272|00000000||There's a little meadow on the edge of the swamp. This strange tree grows there. Look around, you'll see 'im.
    392070|00000000||Thank you.
    392004|00000000||Where's Johnny?
    392062|00000000||Where are you and your friends' parents?
    392064|00000000||Dead. Some starved… others were killed. Like mine…
    401638|00000000||One day, I went out at dawn, to look for berries in the woods... Still some around back then. When I was comin' home, I heard the yells... Then laughing…
    415674|00000000||Went up and hid in the bushes near the woods. My mum yelled. And the soldiers laughed. Laid my pa down by the barn door... His head clean off... And then my mum…
    392066|00000000||It's all right, that's enough...
    392008|00000000||Where are your parents?
    392006|00000000||Why are you afraid?
    392054|00000000||Why're you scared to talk?
    392056|00000000||I'm not scared of nuthin'!
    392058|00000000||You're all scared of something. Woulda told me about Johnny otherwise.
    392060|00000000||I'm worried about Johnny. He don't come 'round no more. Once when we was mushroom pickin', I saw his burrow.
    420374|00000000||But Gran yelled at me. Said not to talk to strangers, 'cause then kids go missin'. She worries 'bout Johnny too, though she says he's made up.
    384569|00000000||Don't be afraid...
    382780|00000000||Don't know nuthin'.
    392000|00000000||I won't hurt you.
    392002|00000000||Where's Gran?
    420368|00000000||She's busy.
   1052327|00000000||Damned mage hunters. Never thought I'd see the day when our councilors let 'em into the city.
   1052329|00000000||City council dances to Radovid's tune, so you just been thinkin' foolish. Shan't be a single mage left soon. Give it a month, maybe two.
   1052331|00000000||I'm no mage meself, don't give a lick what happens to 'em. Thing is, I live near the hunters' headquarters - can't get any sleep the nights.
   1052333|00000000||Why not?
   1052335|00000000||Folk they interrogate shriek so loud they'd wake the dead.
   1072698|00000000||Paint where? Paint here to be, here not. Orders me here paint to be. Yes?
   1032901|00000000||We bow in prayer to the Eternal Fire - our city's patron and protector!
   1032903|00000000||Only unwavering faith in the power of this flame can bring us victory!
   1032905|00000000||Remember, good folk! One doubter can do more evil than a thousand believers can do good!
   1032907|00000000||Ears open and eyes peeled, for evil never sleeps. Let us save our beloved Novigrad! Our free city!
    564411|00000000||Well? Any progress?
   1015918|00000000||You post the notice?
   1015920|00000000||I did, indeed. Hans of Cidaris, mercenary captain. Know of a monster that needs slaying. You interested?
    564407|00000000||Well? What do you want?
    564408|00000000||What could I want of a witcher? Some geese herding? I know of a monster that needs slaying!
    564524|00000000||All right. Where do I start looking?
    564525|00000000||South of here. It's where we split up… it's where we last saw Gerd and Henk alive.
    564522|00000000||Fine.
   1064154|00000000||What?! No chance!
   1064156|00000000||A bit too much, mate… but just a bit. We might still strike a deal.
   1064158|00000000||I'd 'ave gone to hunt the beast meself if I'd known you wanted this much. Hard luck. So be it.
   1064160|00000000||Give me, give me, give me. Sound more like a beggar than a witcher. You'll get what I say, and this here's my final word!
   1015959|00000000||Let's talk about the reward, about how it's just not enough right now.
   1015950|00000000||Let's talk about the reward.
    564372|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    564539|00000000||Lemme think about it. Take care.
    564523|00000000||I'll think about it.
   1015391|00000000||Already took care of it.
    564531|00000000||Took care of the beast already. It was a griffin. An archgriffin, actually.
   1015975|00000000||Thank you. Farewell.
   1015963|00000000||Thank you. And in the future, try summoning a witcher before any blood's spilt.
   1015992|00000000||Hold up a minute. Recognize this? You accepted a contract - reward paid up front, and higher than what you paid me.
   1015994|00000000||What am I meant to do? Business is what it is, and intermediaries deserve their due.
   1015996|00000000||What you're due is a punch in the face. Gold. Now.
   1015999|00000000||Some advice before you go… Don't ever try to cheat a witcher again. Ever.
   1015974|00000000||Not so fast. Not about to be swindled.
   1015961|00000000||In that case I'm grateful. Archgrateful! Your reward…
    564535|00000000||Monster's dead, I slew it. It was a griffin. An archgriffin, in fact.
    564370|00000000||Got rid of the griffin.
    564368|00000000||What kind of monster is it?
    564470|00000000||What kind of monster are we talking about?
    564471|00000000||If I only knew… It was like this - got Radovid to hire me and my company, but he's been late with the pay the last weeks. And I'll be damned if we're to risk our lives for free. Like hell.
   1015943|00000000||Couldn't agree more, but you were gonna tell me about the monster.
    564472|00000000||Yes, yes. We arrived here, encamped, then it turned out some beast prowls the area. Snatches cows and the like. Reckoned we should help the local boys, so we grabbed our weapons and set out - me and Kurt one way, Gerd and Henk the other…
    564473|00000000||Gerd and Henk never returned. Whatever it was, it got 'em. Job's for a professional, clearly, so Kurt and me, we chipped in for a small reward, hoping someone's willing to help the locals, avenge our comrades in the process.
   1015947|00000000||Awfully noble of you.
   1015949|00000000||Hah! Mercenaries - we've our honor, too! Well, master witcher, what will it be? Will you take the job?
   1015953|00000000||Will you tend to the monster or not?
   1071960|00000000||[Play Gwint.]
    581541|00000000||[Win.]
    581542|00000000||[Loss.]
    581539|00000000||I get no pleasure whatsoever from easy victories. So I should be very angry if you let me win.
   1014175|00000000||Don't plan to. Curious about that other proposition, though.
    496161|99a744ea||Basilisk
   1042929|00000000||Oh no, I'll not go in.
   1042931|00000000||Somebody's gotta get the boards.
   1043024|00000000||Pull 'em out yourself if you think they're so valuable.
   1043026|00000000||The former lord of this castle took rebellious peasants, cast 'em down the well.
   1043028|00000000||So down bottom, you've either ghosts or the corpse-eaters that done ate them.
   1033088|00000000||Anyone home?
   1021035|00000000||Hm, normal candle.
   1019198|00000000||So this is where she disappeared to.
   1033100|00000000||Powerful aura - must be some artifact, or…
   1033102|00000000||A pentagram in chalk.
   1041241|00000000||There's the boulder…
   1041243|00000000||Now right, and on to the cart.
   1041239|00000000||Supposed to be a large stone near the pond.
   1041245|00000000||The cart… witch's hut is somewhere nearby.
   1019732|00000000||Now where's she run off to?
   1056578|00000000||Greetings, Lambert.
   1058255|00000000||Damn it's good to see you, Wolf.
   1058257|00000000||Decide to do some hunting in Novigrad? Far as I remember, you never liked this city.
   1058259|00000000||Still don't. Thing is, got a certain matter to take care of.
   1075508|00000000||Where've you been? What've you been up to?
   1075513|00000000||What've you been up to? Any luck on the Path?
   1075515|00000000||A lot, in fact. Quite the takings in Lan Exeter. Was asked to hunt down a giant, who turned out to be a forest troll, and some bandits.
   1075517|00000000||Bandits?
   1075519|00000000||Came as a package with the troll.
   1075507|00000000||Need help with that matter?
   1075510|00000000||The matter you mentioned - anything I can help with?
   1075527|00000000||Hm. Maybe. But we'll talk about that later.
    581233|00000000||Let's go.
    581229|00000000||Let's go.
   1005059|00000000||Fine, but try not take too long. Know where the supervisor has his office?
   1005061|00000000||Yeah, had a chat with a guardsman outside it. See you there.
    581232|00000000||Join you for that later. Wait up for me?
    581230|00000000||Join you later.
    581226|00000000||Got our reward to collect. I'm kinda in a hurry. Let's say you've earned half, what the hell.
   1005067|00000000||Good work.
   1005069|00000000||What're you doing in Novigrad? Never mentioned coming here.
   1005071|00000000||Got a certain matter to take care of.
   1035250|00000000||Vesemir'd chew you out for such recklessness.
   1035252|00000000||There was no need to hide.
   1005063|00000000||But I'd rather you tell me what you're doing here. Got the sense you didn't want to stay on at Kaer Morhen much longer, but didn't expect you'd abandon the place so soon.
   1005065|00000000||You're right - didn't have the slightest desire to stay on.
    581223|00000000||Told you to hide.
    584387|00000000||Pretty apparent that wasn't necessary.
   1005053|00000000||To think they call me reckless. Ehh, Geralt.
    584391|00000000||Never thought you'd abandon Kaer Morhen so soon, but it's good to see you again, Lambert.
    581224|00000000||Finally listened to me... for once in your life.
   1005055|00000000||Nice to see you, too, Lambert. Didn't really need to hide, you know - nothing but a lowly lower vampire, after all. I only did 'cause I thought it'd make you happy.
   1005057|00000000||Heheh. Glad to see you, Wolf.
   1045685|00000000||Let's play burn the witch!
   1045687|00000000||Yayyy! She can be the witch!
   1045689|00000000||I don't wanna be a witch. Burnin' witches are horrible stinky.
   1045691|00000000||I know. Been at a burnin'. Me pappy took me.
    519867|00000000||To your son, Jost! May he take after his father!
    519880|00000000||So he'll be a milkman! Hahahah!
   1054357|00000000||Monster slayer, oooooh. Any bloke can kill a beast.
   1055571|d519a2f3||Merchant
   1040576|00000000||All right, lads. Fun's over, back to your places. Come on, Hal!
   1041644|00000000||Ahahah! Can't wait to get the King of Beggars outta my beard.
   1055765|00000000||Ah, here already! Come on, let's find some arse-rests. Should start soon.
    501949|00000000||Seems Dandelion left nothing out.
    501955|00000000||Seems Dandelion was meticulous in telling my story, down to personal and insignificant details. Did he offer anything about himself - like where he was going?
    501957|00000000||Hahahahah! Splendid! Very funny, truly! So, see you later!
    501960|00000000||Not here. Come with me.
    501951|00000000||There's a good reason I don't pour my heart out to bards - they always babble, as you just demonstrated.
    501953|00000000||But listen, besides giving you the details of my affairs, did Dandelion mention his own plans, where he might be going?
    501948|00000000||Bards - not people I confide in.
    499490|00000000||Permit me… to introduce… err… This here's Priscilla, known also as Callonetta. As lovely as she is talented. And this…
    501924|00000000||… is Geralt of Rivia, I know. Dandelion's told me a great deal about you, and I've listened with bated breath.
    501927|00000000||Don't be surprised. After all, doubt I could think of a more fitting subject for a ballad than a witcher's love for a sorceress…
    501944|00000000||Or should I say - sorceresses?
    418871|00000000||There's the door! Settle this outside!
    418873|00000000||Come.
    418875|00000000||I wish to listen to music! Music!
    418877|00000000||Cultural capital of the world - the fuck it is.
   1068054|00000000||If I know Geralt, he risked his noggin to save someone else's arse!
   1068056|00000000||Save, you say?! He murdered folk!
   1068059|00000000||Don't let 'em provoke you.
    437465|00000000||I know him!
    418863|00000000||Twas him murdered some Temerian boys back in White Orchard!
    437467|00000000||Silence, woman. We've come to hear music.
    418865|00000000||A murderer?
    420663|00000000||There's a war on. Some die.
    420669|00000000||Oh, please argue this out elsewhere.
    420665|00000000||Squabbles and rows again! And I was told this was a decent establishment!
   1083641|00000000||{This line is for technical purpose only.}
   1067967|00000000||These scars long have yearned for your tender caress. To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own
   1067971|00000000||Rend my heart open, then your love profess. A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone
   1067975|00000000||You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   1067979|00000000||To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy. Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
   1067983|00000000||The wolf I will follow into the storm. To find your heart, its passion displaced
   1067987|00000000||By ire ever growing, hardening into stone. Amidst the cold to hold you in a heated embrace
   1067991|00000000||You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   1067995|00000000||To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
   1067997|00000000||Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
   1067999|00000000||I know not if fate would have us live as one. Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound
   1068003|00000000||The wish I whispered, when it all began. Did it forge a love you might never have found?
   1068007|00000000||You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   1068011|00000000||To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
   1068013|00000000||Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep

   1087785|00000000||{This line is for technical purpose only.}
    492684|00000000||Saved you a seat. Set yourself down. Priscilla's on next.
   1067813|00000000||Soldiers tell you anything?
   1067837|00000000||His brothers in arms tell you anything?
   1067839|00000000||Some will not speak at all, others lie. This… quartermaster, for instance. He told me Hrodberth, my son, left the camp to scout… and did not return.
   1067841|00000000||Why, is that… unlikely?
   1067843|00000000||He serves in the light cavalry. Nazairi Brigade. My son was no scout.
   1067868|00000000||Do my best to help you.
   1067870|00000000||You will not regret it. There is nothing I would not do for Hrodberth. Remember this.
   1067872|00000000||I'll ask around, see if I can learn something.
   1068234|00000000||My servant strove to do the same. He drank with the soldiery in the mess, but met no one from my son's company. It is as if it has ceased to exist.
   1067874|00000000||You must speak to the quartermaster. He is dismissive of me, but he will be more candid with you. I can feel it. A mother feels these things.
   1068080|00000000||Guess we'll see…
   1065763|00000000||Yeah. I'll help.
   1067847|00000000||Sorry, can't help.
   1067882|00000000||Sorry, Just not in my line of work, finding soldiers who've gone missing. But I do hope you find him, ma'am. Alive.
   1065764|00000000||Sorry, can't help.
   1067849|00000000||What's your son look like?
   1067851|00000000||Unlike others, easily distinguished. In all Nilfgaard's army, I do not think there was another with his mane… The color of fire…
   1067853|00000000||A red-haired Nilfgaardian?
   1067855|00000000||His father hailed from Mag Turga. Folk have light complexions there. My son inherited this trait, and others, from his father…
   1067857|00000000||May I count on your help?
   1067846|00000000||What's he look like?
   1067845|00000000||I require someone's help to find Hrodberth… or his body. Coin is no object.
   1067815|00000000||Don't mean to dash your hopes, but not all soldiers come home from war.
   1067817|00000000||I know what war is. My husband fell at Brenna. But I had his body brought home to Nilfgaard, buried there. I will do the same for my son.
   1067819|00000000||If I must.
   1067812|00000000||Son might be dead.
   1068100|00000000||Why'd you come here?
   1068102|00000000||Why'd you decide to look for your son, now?
   1068104|00000000||He wrote letters - to me, to his fiancé… regularly. They would come in the post each week. And suddenly they stopped.
   1068106|00000000||This was unlike him. Something had happened, I knew.
   1067811|00000000||I have come from far away… I… to seek my son. He served in the Nazairi cavalry. I must find him. I simply must.
   1067876|00000000||I'm not one of your soldiers.
   1067878|00000000||This is good. Our army refused to help. Yet help is what I need. So much so I will ask a rock troll, if required.
   1067880|00000000||Interesting train of thought, ma'am…
   1052522|00000000||You seen the new waitresses?
   1052524|00000000||No. Are they worth seeing?
   1052526|00000000||And how. Buxom lasses from lands already taken by Nilfgaard.
   1052528|00000000||They must need someone to show them around Novigrad…
   1052530|00000000||You read my mind…
    437927|00000000||I'm about to snap, I am… How much can a man take?
    437929|00000000||Since yesterday been standin' here. Moved as much as shit in an ice hole.
    437925|00000000||Fuckin' 'ell… Eternal Fire's like to go out 'fore I get them papers.
    483383|00000000||Guess I should find an oven.
    483384|00000000||Saw an oven in the cellar… Maybe I'll find another clue there.
    483382|00000000||Another masterpiece. An oven and a blackened grate. Oh joy, a riddle…
   1053003|00000000||Sun's high already, Betje, and you've barely gathered a second basket. Not good.
   1053005|00000000||Got this pain in me back, and me fingers're stiff… so it's takin' longer.
   1053007|00000000||You know the rules. If you can't gather ten baskets 'fore sunset, you needn't show up tomorrow.
   1053009|00000000||Have mercy, lad… Been doin' this since the old lord's days… I've always tried me best.
   1053011|00000000||What you've done but don't do anymore just don't count. Back to work, Betje. And take me advice - try harder.
    476596|00000000||What was that inscription again?
    476598|00000000||"Four guardians, four flames, standing proud in a line. The First to light his fire dared not march on the end.
    478264|00000000||The Second, beside the First, played a woeful lament. The Third kept close to his faithful beast.
    478266|00000000||The Fourth marched not beside the First, yet like the Second, played a tune. And thus they stood o'er their queen, who slept beneath flickering stars."
    490067|00000000||You'll not leave here alive, understand? No chance!
    422011|00000000||So long.
    422005|00000000||Farewell.
    422001|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422007|00000000||Show me what you have on offer.
    421999|00000000||Yeah, welcome to my workshop. Sturdy craftsmanship at a reasonable price!
    377440|00000000||Pipe's grate… Explosion crumpled it like a piece of paper, and there's mortar on the bars.
    377442|00000000||So, it was in place at the time of the explosion… Blast tore it from the wall.
    481186|00000000||Kick it!
    571716|00000000||Yous all can kiss me down under.
    571718|00000000||Your arse-hair gray too?
    571720|00000000||Touch me wifey and I'll smack ye sideways.
    511142|00000000||We gots to make sure the pricklicker's not here.
    513571|00000000||Ach. I'd expect teeth to grow up me arse before I'd expect to find Whoreson hidin' in his house!
    511143|00000000||Cleaver said to be thorough, so we look everywhere.
    511144|00000000||Ought to burn the corpses, though. Else rats'll congregate to feast.
    367076|00000000||So you're the ones…
    370464|00000000||Oi, Fatso, look what we got here. Is it just me, or you got cat eyes?
    368341|00000000||Right he does! Stray cat must've fucked his mum! Heheheh!
    368343|00000000||Now what you doin' in the city of the Eternal Fire, catshit?
    368349|00000000||Why you always comin' back?
    368397|00000000||Never mind. I'm going.
    368399|00000000||Fuck off then! No one's keepin' you!
    446476|00000000||See you.
    446474|00000000||Leave the Puffins alone.
    446478|00000000||Leave the Puffins alone.
    446480|00000000||Worms that insulted Hierarch Hemmelfart? Called him a whoremonger? I'd sooner snuff out the Holy Flame itself!
    446482|00000000||Tell them fuckin' poets to come down here. Shove their flutes up their blasphemin' arseholes!
    446490|00000000||Yeah, they'll play a different tune then - every time they fart! Hahah!
    368353|00000000||Get out of here. Now.
    368355|00000000||Wha?!
    449489|00000000||Fuck yeah!
    367078|00000000||Go away. Now.
    393369|00000000||You guessed it.
    393365|00000000||Guessed it.
    393371|00000000||Trash like you - not even worth bruising my fists.
    393373|00000000||Look at that! Tough guy's turned coward! Harharharharhar!
    393367|00000000||Not worth it.
    368357|00000000||Give you coin to leave.
    368359|00000000||Fine. Give 'er here.
    368361|00000000||Cept we're not goin' nowhere. Well, Yohan might run and get some wine, now we've got the means.
    368365|00000000||I really dislike being cheated.
    449491|00000000||Come on then. Gonna rip me?
    367080|00000000||I'll pay you to go away.
    368345|00000000||Leave them alone.
    368391|00000000||Leave the Puffins alone.
    368393|00000000||Aye... We will... Alone...
    368395|00000000||What the hell?
    449493|00000000||Black magic! He's a fuckin' witch, get 'im!
    490752|00000000||What the hell's this?
    490754|00000000||What's it to you, you prancin' freak?
    490770|00000000||Look, he scared off our new friend. Can't have a civil conversation in public these days without some dreg buttin' in.
    490772|00000000||This is the city of the Eternal Fire. No room for his kind here.
    368351|00000000||Lookin' for a beatin? Well, you just found one.
   1016327|00000000||Begone. You ought not to be here.
   1016329|00000000||Leave. Flee while you can.

    389411|2ec9fb68||Townsman
    532407|2617e85c||Poor Townsman
    482142|00000000||Just passing by, wanderer, or do you seek something specific?
    493588|00000000||Who's asking?
    493590|00000000||Rudolf de Jonkheer.
    493592|00000000||Of those de Jonkheers, yes. My ancestors laid the foundations of this city. I now own its largest bank.
    501469|00000000||Didn't need a recommendation. Name would've been enough.
    501471|00000000||Father always said: "All ought to know your merits, son. Don't hide them under a bushel."
    493614|00000000||I'd like to go inside, look around.
    493616|00000000||I don't usually let strangers rummage around my home. Twin swords, though… you're a witcher. You may enter - call that my whim.
    493598|00000000||Let me in?
    493602|00000000||Why do you need to know the house's history? You a historian, or on a whim?
    493604|00000000||I bought this property a short while ago - paid a pretty penny, I might add. Soon after, I witnessed… disturbances. Led me to fear the home might be haunted.
    493606|00000000||What're the symptoms?
    493608|00000000||Oh, they vary. Giggling… in the night. And furniture moving about in the attic, and last week… well, you shan't believe it - I found human feces in the parlor.
    493599|00000000||The house's history - why do you care about it?
    493600|00000000||Why're you standing here?
    493610|00000000||Not interested in what's going on inside? Seeing it for yourself?
    493612|00000000||I'm a banker. Cursed homes scare me - do you know how a haunting can affect property value? Point of fact, Corinne requested she not be disturbed.
    482145|00000000||I'm looking for Corinne Tilly.
    482146|00000000||You've come to the right place, then. Corinne is inside… Been there for a few days, dreaming the home's history.
    482143|00000000||I'm looking for Corinne.
    482285|00000000||So long.
    482144|00000000||Farewell.
    493597|00000000||You seem drawn to this place, wanderer.
    427292|00000000||Aye, s'bout right. Well, Novigrad's full of nooks and crannies with odd names. Lookin' to sightsee, buy a bloody map.
    427296|00000000||Heard men like you frequent this alley.
    427298|00000000||And I've heard they fed you horse shit and you smiled and ate it.
    427300|00000000||Now - don't mean no offense. Go in peace.
    427286|00000000||There's this place in Novigrad they call the Putrid Grove.
    427282|00000000||I'm looking for the Putrid Grove.
    427288|00000000||Changed my mind, actually. Don't need a thing.
    427290|00000000||Tourists.
    427284|00000000||Never mind.
    381314|00000000||Take pity on me misery, good folk, and aid a man crippled by misfortune.
    356054|00000000||Word is nothing's free in Novigrad.
    422677|00000000||Hnn, another one come burstin' with questions. Now where'd you folk gain the idea we beggars know everythin'?
    427280|00000000||"I need to see this'un, I need to find that one." "Who robbed me brother?"... Fuck if I know…
   1011669|00000000||Old man Numan left me a gift last time!
   1011670|00000000||What?! He's never given me nothin' but floppy diddly.
   1011671|00000000||If you don't know how to give, you can't receive…
   1011672|00000000||Sayin' I'm no good at givin'?!
   1026124|00000000||To give, you gotta have talent… and character.
    569793|00000000||You can't hope to manage this alone. You're afraid, that's clear. Wraith'll hold sway over you.
    569794|00000000||Listen, I'll send him off, I've got to. But I need to know where he's buried. Corpse probably hasn't turned to dust yet - that's his bond to the world of the living.
    569796|00000000||Ambros… lies in the swamp.
    569798|00000000||Fine, I'll find his body. See what I can do.
    569790|00000000||Gotta do something about this.
    569791|00000000||Wraith called you a patricide.
    569800|00000000||That wraith called you a patricide. He get it right?
    569802|00000000||Aye.
    569804|00000000||If I'm gonna help you, I gotta know everything. Why'd you kill your father?
    569806|00000000||The pellar does not wish to speak of this.
    569783|00000000||Alas. All is lost.
    569785|00000000||Hm. Gotta be a peasant who told the Witch Hunters about the ritual.
    569787|00000000||That spirit they drove away - your father's ghost, right? Threatened to come back, likely to keep his word.
    569789|00000000||Old man Ambros the pellar fears not.
   1021447|00000000||And who might you be?!
   1021449|00000000||Bringin' your drinkin' mates home now, is that it?!
   1021451|00000000||I don't know them.
   1021453|00000000||Likely!
   1021455|00000000||Get the hell outta my house!
   1021457|00000000||Was just on my way out.
    569084|00000000||Witcher, witcher!
   1064999|00000000||Corinne, look who's come.
   1065003|00000000||Huh, live here together now? Didn't know.
   1065026|00000000||Once you told me Sarah'd been responsible for my nightmares, I decided to see if the devil's as scary as they paint him… or her.
   1074229|00000000||I came in to find not a fiend, but our little Sarah. And… I can't say why, but we took a liking to one another immediately.
   1021495|00000000||Go with Avallac'h, we'll talk later.
   1065007|00000000||We must hurry. The portal will open soon.
   1065009|00000000||Of course.
   1021467|00000000||We shall return soon with your patient.
   1021475|00000000||I shall be waiting.
   1027325|00000000||This way, Geralt.
    518467|00000000||Oh! There's our friend…
    519407|00000000||Why you botherin' him, you grub? Can't you see he's busy?
    518287|00000000||Psst! Grayhair! C'mere!
    518383|00000000||Nah… Wouldn't hide here. Witcher got it wrong.
    332382|00365006||Bandit
   1055030|00000000||This one cost wery much, guv'nor?
   1055032|00000000||Not "very" much at all.
   1055034|00000000||And this'n 'ere? How much you be wantin'?
   1055036|00000000||That one there is not for sale.
    586238|00000000||All right. Let's pay Karadin a visit.
    582477|00000000||Let's go see Karadin.
    586235|00000000||All right. Meet you outside Karadin's house.
    582479|00000000||Wait for you in a gateway off the Round.
    582478|00000000||Meet you outside his house.
   1037303|00000000||What about Selyse?
   1037305|00000000||Anything on Selyse?
   1037307|00000000||Hm. Well, didn't have you there to stand up for her.
    582461|00000000||What the hell took you?
    582462|00000000||Pretty likely Karadin lives in Novigrad. And he never severed ties with Hammond. They're actually in business together.
    582464|00000000||Mhm. Learned something, too - he trades in, uh, live goods on the sly. Owns a ship called the Pearl of the Coast - runs between here and Skellige. Changed his name, too, to Roland Treugger, who officially is a respected Novigrad trader and philanthropist.
   1037302|00000000||Has a residence in Gildorf.
   1072705|00000000||Thank ye, master. Ye saved my life! You ever come through Claywich, you give us a holler. I'll shave ye and sheer ye for free!
   1065907|637b0183||Renegade Leader
   1004782|00000000||I beg ye… I'm innocent, I swear.
   1004783|00000000||Guess it was prophet Lebioda attacked the merchants, then?
   1004784|00000000||Stealin' the goods and blindin' those poor bastards… Made the baron sad, it did.
   1004785|00000000||Now I'll have 'em stick a hot poker in your eyes…
   1004786|00000000||Noooo!
   1032542|00000000||When do you think to finish the next batch?
   1032543|00000000||You ought not rush an artist.
   1032549|00000000||Artist! You've but to paint eyebrows on them now.
   1032550|00000000||Eyebrows require a master's touch. They must speak to a man's character.
   1032580|00000000||In fact, that's how experts distinguish an original.
    522407|00000000||Now! Get 'im!
   1041868|00000000||Sure hope Dudu hasn't met the same fate.
   1007435|00000000||May I count on your help, Geralt?
   1007422|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
   1007419|00000000||You Fritjof?
   1007420|00000000||That's right. And what do they call you, witcher?
   1014940|00000000||Me? Drifter, stranger, mutant… Sometimes even by my name. Geralt of Rivia.
   1014942|00000000||Hah! A man with a sense of humor. I like that. Well, what can I do for you, Geralt of Rivia?
   1007436|00000000||Sure, I'll help. Provided you go see Gremist afterwards.
   1007438|00000000||Agreed. Now follow me. Time for a little storm.
   1007433|00000000||Deal. A favor for a favor.
   1007434|00000000||Gimme me a minute.
   1015009|00000000||Gimme a minute… Need to prepare.
   1007426|00000000||Nothing at the moment. I'll come back later.
   1007425|00000000||Nothing just yet.
   1007424|00000000||Gremist wants to see you.
   1007427|00000000||Gremist wanted me to summon you. Needs you to help him perform a ritual.
   1014978|00000000||A ritual? Will this one stop him from being a mean old goat? I would go see him, for old time's sake, but I've more important matters on my mind.
   1014980|00000000||Look about you. The ground - see how dry it is? It's not rained for weeks. The grass in pastures has withered, sheep are starving. I must bring rain, but fear that--
   1014982|00000000||Wait just a moment! Perhaps you could help me?
   1014984|00000000||How? I'm a man of many talents, but manipulating the weather's not one of them.
   1014986|00000000||I have in mind a different skill, involving your sword. You see, Mother Nature dislikes it when you take something from her by force. She will defend herself. So fiercely, in fact, that I could use a defender myself. What do you say?
   1055934|00000000||Can we give it another shot? Please?
   1055936|00000000||We must, I suppose. But this time… do please make an effort.
   1055938|00000000||So… May we begin? Same terms as last time?
   1055716|00000000||The witcher?! It's him you should burn! He-e-aaargh! He killed your comrades! At the Vegelbud ball!
   1055718|00000000||Riiiight, sure. A witcher at a noblemen's ball. Who else was there? Couple beggars, whores?
   1055723|00000000||Help me! I beg you! Aaaaargh!
   1055714|00000000||Noooo! Mercy! I shall tell you all! Aaaaargh!
   1056246|00000000||S'all right. I'm content just listenin' to you wail, now.
   1055712|00000000||Aaaaargh! Aaaaaah!
   1055730|00000000||Here's my advice, and it's good advice. Find Triss. Lame duck might still be willing to help you.
   1055726|00000000||Find Triss. Might still be willing to help you.
   1055727|00000000||Next time, don't point me out.
   1055734|00000000||Next time, just wail, call for help. Don't point me out, try to damn me, too… Go on, get out of here. Before any guards show.
   1056248|00000000||I know you. Moritz Diefenthel, right? Triss' friend, didn't see the slightest reason to flee Novigrad.
   1055725|00000000||The same… just singed. I thank you, witcher. And I… appreciate I was wrong.
    501981|00000000||I dare you to say it again!
    502097|00000000||I... I didn't say nothin'…
    501982|00000000||Not enough he's a heretic, he's also a liar! What'll we do with 'im?
    502122|00000000||We'll bruise his kidneys… Unless he's got somethin' in that pouch…
    416176|00000000||Guess that's everyone. Found you all.
    416178|00000000||You don't play right.
    416505|00000000||But we'll help. Come on, let's talk to the others, by the cottage.
    383202|00000000||A voice... from within the tree…
    327446|00000000||Ugh… And I thought witcher's potions were vile…
    498275|00000000||You're stupid and a pig!
   1054345|00000000||Eternal Fire doesn't scare away monsters after all. Good thing we've got you!
    515892|00000000||C'mon, gents! Double quick, fast as farts, go at it!
    515893|00000000||Since the locals are provin' cowards, perhaps an outlander'll find the courage?
    427346|00000000||No. I need information.
    427352|00000000||I'm looking for the Putrid Grove. Need you to help me find it.
    358339|00000000||Don't know naught about no grove, putrid or other. Don't generally care much for orchardry.
    358341|00000000||This is urgent.
    358347|00000000||Leave me be. I don't know.
    427348|00000000||Here.
    427350|00000000||Now you help me. Gotta find the back alley locals call the Putrid Grove. It's important.
    427344|00000000||Sure, then you help me.
    430721|00000000||Farewell.
    430719|00000000||So long.
    427336|00000000||Aid a veteran of the struggle against the Black Ones?
    427338|00000000||Where'd you fight?
    427340|00000000||Angren early on. In Cidaris last, along the banks of the Pontar. So, help me out?
    452051|00000000||Last I was here, she was nothing like this. Crones must've cursed her.
    452057|00000000||Can you lift this curse?
    452059|00000000||Not till I know what it is.
    452061|00000000||She can't have lived here alone. Perhaps there's someone else, someone who saw something…
    452088|00000000||Maybe Johnny…
    452090|00000000||Who?
    452141|00000000||Err… A boy. A hermit. Lives in the swamp. Came around here from time to time. He mighta seen something.
    452143|00000000||We must find him.
    452147|00000000||Doesn't like strangers. You wait here. I'm better off going alone.
    452023|00000000||She's been cursed.
    452025|00000000||Calm down. You're not helping.
    452027|00000000||Easy. Shouting won't help. Calm down.
    452029|00000000||Simple for you to say! How can I?! That's my mother, understand?!
    452045|00000000||He's on our side. Let him think.
    452049|00000000||Witcher, do you know what is wrong with the woman?
    448577|00000000||Just look at her…
   1071963|00000000||Witcher, you know of these things, you must. What… what's wrong with her?
   1071733|00000000||What was that?
    448497|00000000||Looked a fiend to me.
    448499|00000000||Crones've sensed us, they know we're close. Sent the beast for Anna.
   1071735|00000000||Those damned witches! When will it end?! Look what they've done to her! Are they not satisfied?!
   1071976|00000000||Enough.
    448495|00000000||I'm taking her away.
    448516|00000000||She's my wife. She'll return home with me. You're welcome to come with us, if you wish.
    448518|00000000||Don't touch her! We leave this cursed place now.
    452276|00000000||She's sick, weakened… Where would you take her in this state? Oxenfurt? It would mean her death!
    452278|00000000||I know how to care for my mother!
    452282|00000000||She's not a rag doll to be ripped from hand to hand! Let her decide!
    448520|00000000||Pie! Pie for dinner! Mud pie!
    448536|00000000||She's incapable of deciding anything just now.
    448538|00000000||A dark spell, it must be. Help her, witcher. I beg you.
    452343|00000000||We need to go, take her somewhere safe.
    452345|00000000||Before we do anything, we've gotta get her out of here. Crones know we've come for her. Might send another monster, something worse than a fiend.
    452347|00000000||I'll not go anywhere until you tell me you can help her, break the spell.
    452316|00000000||Dark spell, not likely.
    452355|00000000||This is no dark spell, I'm afraid.
    452357|00000000||Well, what is it then?
    452369|00000000||She's been through a lot. Lost a child, was carried off by a fiend, lived in the Crones' village taking care of children who're now gone… It's left its mark, as it would on anyone.
    452371|00000000||So it's hopeless? You can't help her? She's to be like this?
    498933|00000000||I'm sorry.
    452373|00000000||I know a hermit, a very wise man with a gift for healing. Met him some time past. Lives in the Blue Mountains. I shall take her there.
    452417|00000000||It's no use. Doubt a healer can do anything for her now. Doubt anyone can.
    452438|00000000||I must do something!
    452383|00000000||Makes no sense.
    452381|00000000||Worth a try.
    452385|00000000||Might be worth a shot.
    452464|00000000||I shall go with you.
    452466|00000000||That's impossible, sadly.
    452468|00000000||Why?
    452470|00000000||You have duties, duties deriving from your commitment to the Church of the Eternal Fire. Once we finish our work in Velen, we return to Oxenfurt.
    452472|00000000||You said you'd save my mother!
    452476|00000000||And I kept my word. Your father can care for her now.
    452478|00000000||He, care? You know him! You know what he did to her!
    452490|00000000||He swears to be a changed man. And in his eyes I see true sorrow, remorse for his sins. He will care for her. And you've a new life, and new duties - to the Eternal Fire.
   1071992|00000000||Fear not, all will be well.
    452513|00000000||I will not touch drink. I will find the hermit. And once she is herself again, we will find you.
    452545|00000000||Swear it.
    452547|00000000||You have my word, child.
    452618|00000000||Thank you, witcher. Despite all.
   1015510|00000000||May the Eternal Fire guide and protect you.
    452638|00000000||Farewell.
    515663|00000000||Ploughin' swamp. Pox-ridden air promotes brain-rot in the peasants.
    519606|00000000||Crones, fuck me. What will these hayseeds think of next?!
    515667|00000000||The Crones exist. You'll know that soon enough.
    519626|00000000||Hah, right. More likely some mad old wenches making mincemeat of peasant minds.
    519628|00000000||Likely Anna agreed to stay with 'em, care for 'em out of the kindness of her heart. Good as gold, that one, always…
    519635|00000000||Mhm.
    335056|00000000||They're on to us… They'll not let Graham in.
    335058|00000000||Quiet, fool! Babble on and the noble himself will hear ye.
    335060|00000000||Nah… He's sat his arse on silk pillows. Likely be gobblin' meat, heheh!
    453463|00000000||…with no notion we's comin' to tear him to shreds.
    335062|00000000||Way's clear, lads! At 'em!
    567562|00000000||Perfect hideout - for an owl…
    589042|00000000||Be a bit harder for me to move around.
    567599|00000000||Portals, great. And the witch hunters probably messed with them.
    567606|00000000||Works. Who woulda thunk.
    567727|00000000||Hate portals. Make my stomach turn.
    568177|00000000||Damn - inactive.
    589048|00000000||Maybe I can start it up…
    568227|00000000||Did it. Activated the portal.
    568228|00000000||Oh yeah, gotta have a sentry, of course…
    568231|00000000||Yen'll know what to do with this.
    568233|00000000||Gotta go back to Kaer Morhen.
    568232|00000000||Guess I gotta go to Skellige.
    568230|00000000||Triss'll know what to do with this.
    568229|00000000||Crystal from a megascope… heavily chipped.
    589309|00000000||Wonder if it still works.
    568327|00000000||Must've been her laboratory.
    568362|00000000||Gotta be the lowest level.
    569266|00000000||Missing one tile.
    569533|00000000||Chest completely crushed. Ribs must've pierced the lungs.
    569534|00000000||Ooo, flesh charred to the bone in places.
    569577|00000000||Hmm, a power cell for portals… Feels dead.
   1000702|00000000||Maybe a Sign'll revive it…?
    569578|00000000||Should work now…
    569627|00000000||Right, now to activate it…
    570359|00000000||Power cell. Got it.
   1000704|00000000||Another inactive portal.
   1000706|00000000||Missing its power cell… maybe the nekkers took a liking to it.
   1000722|00000000||Harpy feather, a rectrix.
   1000743|00000000||Gotta be some mechanism that opens this door.
   1001235|00000000||Hm, a tunnel… Wonder where it leads.
   1074156|00000000||Mhm. Nekkers - might've expected as much. The love places like this.
   1008754|00000000||I tell ye it's all 'cause of his little slag.
   1008756|00000000||I don't blame him for goin' to war… But why'd he have to bring a whore home?
   1008758|00000000||Aye. The gods had to punish us.
   1008760|00000000||We allowed it, we allowed the harlotry.
    582734|00000000||Eeee-yah!
    582735|00000000||Whoa, Cinderella! Or you'll have a great fall!
    582736|00000000||As fast as you can! Try to catch me!
   1087704|00000000||Please… I'm beggin'!
   1020962|00000000||Whaddaya you want? Mind your own matters, I advise ye well!
   1021507|00000000||Sod off! Get outta here!
   1020943|00000000||Who the devil's this?
   1020945|00000000||What'll become of us…?
   1020787|00000000||Oh, aye. Rain. Perfect.
   1020947|00000000||Oh dearie…
   1020949|00000000||Gonna be killin'!
   1020789|00000000||Cheeky bastard!
   1020953|00000000||Monsters breed well in wartime, do they?
   1020941|00000000||May fortune treat us with kindness.
   1020951|00000000||Wait, wait… Griffin? White Orchard? Ring a bell?
   1050722|00000000||The Black 'uns be evil and all, but when they rode by, one o' them tossed me little Voytie a chunk of bread.
   1050724|00000000||Watch he don't break out with a fever.
   1050726|00000000||What're you on about?
   1050728|00000000||They handed out fatback in one village. Now, why, it's naught but a graveyard.
   1050876|00000000||Voytie, come here!
    366522|00000000||Guards! Pickpocket!
   1044291|00000000||You're using me.
   1045467|00000000||You're using me. Don't like it one bit.
   1045469|00000000||And I don't like lacy frills and Redanian novels, but you don't hear me complaining. Now follow me!
   1045463|00000000||We were supposed to train, not go for a walk--
   1045465|00000000||I know, Geralt. Now stop harping on about it and let's go!
   1044290|00000000||What about training?
   1044810|00000000||Finally. Let's go, Geralt. I've something I wish to show you.
   1044287|00000000||Nilfgaardian regiment always accompany you on your walks?
   1044573|00000000||Always. Papa's orders. "It's for your protection, Rosa, dear! People here hate us!" Why? What have I done to them? But enough about that. Soldier! You may leave!
   1044575|00000000||But His Excellency Ambassador var Attre said that--
   1045460|00000000||And this excellency is telling you otherwise! Do you not recognize him? This is Geralt of Rivia, the best swordsman the North has ever seen! I'm safe with him. Now march off! Quickly! Left, right, left, right!
   1044420|00000000||Geralt! Over here!
    382055|00000000||A handprint… Someone leaned on this mirror… or pushed it.
    390101|00000000||Sugar… and lumps of a substance dipped in wyvern oil. Hmm… potassium?
    390103|00000000||Looks like they made the bomb here…
    390095|00000000||Stain… wyvern oil.
    390105|00000000||Silver cylinder… Bottom looks like what I found in the sewer…
    488721|00000000||Instructions on how to build a bomb… Signed by one Kalkstein.
    491252|00000000||A handprint…
    376859|00000000||Footprints…
    170812|f3248005||Water Hag
   1052723|00000000||Dearie, nights it's best to bar the door and shut your windows tight.
   1052725|00000000||I've been hearin' gallopin' and terrible, devilish howls! 'Tis the Wild Hunt's wraiths ridin' down upon us!
   1052727|00000000||Mum, I've told ye already. 'Tain't wraiths.
   1052729|00000000||Tis the baron's men and their blasted horse races.
    458671|00000000||Mercy… I've had enough.
    458667|00000000||Come back, you coward! I'm not done with you!
    458581|00000000||Hello, Vivian! No use pretending you don't know me!
    458655|00000000||You asked for it…
    458651|00000000||You asked for it…
    458659|00000000||Let's go, Triss. Wouldn't wanna make a scene.
    458661|00000000||Vivian! Hey! Ah, I liked you much better when you worked the carriages outside the Passiflora.
    458653|00000000||Triss, let's get out of here.
    458637|00000000||Is that any way to treat an old mate? Refuse to acknowledge him?
    470197|00000000||There's been a mistake. I don't know you, sir.
    470200|00000000||Don't be foolish, Vivian… I'd recognize that mane anywhere.
    470210|00000000||You might play the great dame now, but before that Baron Edward… something… pulled you from the gutter, you were a common--
    458639|00000000||Enough. The lady said she doesn't know you.
    458641|00000000||Who's this? The new one? Older than the last, it seems. A decrepit moss-covered prick. So, the less they can, the more they pay, is that it?
    313590|acc55a20||Bandit
    404897|00000000||Refuse to just stand by and watch.
    404913|00000000||Stop this. End it.
    404915|00000000||We shall not heed a stooge who goes about on the clergy's leash.
    404923|00000000||You'll do what you want. But if I were you, I'd get out of here. On account of the ghouls.
    503132|00000000||And you beware. For he who long fights monsters turns monster himself. And the, uh… abyss gazes into him, also.
    503136|00000000||Sheesh. Students…
    404919|00000000||Not about to get involved.
    404925|00000000||Amusing as this little show is, I'm getting bored. Leave and don't come back.
    503138|00000000||Or what?!
    503140|00000000||Or I'll tell on you to the headmistress.
    503141|00000000||Repression! Attack the system's lackey!
    404921|00000000||Can't let you vandalize shrines.
    404901|00000000||Religion is the opiate of the masses! The gods are dead! Thus speaks Master Friedrich of Oxenfurt!
    420519|00000000||Common folk fear religion and the priests, not the gods. And this fear enslaves us in fetters of ignorance! We must forge a new morality - or rid ourselves of morality altogether.
    404899|00000000||The locals claim the gods are unhappy. No fear of their wrath?
    404909|00000000||The wrath of the gods? The gods are dead! We but dispose of their rotting remains - the dying embers of superstition that harms.
    404911|00000000||Great. Need a favor, though - you gotta clean up after yourselves here. Then go back to wherever you came from - dispose of those embers there.
    404895|00000000||No fear of the gods' wrath?
    404885|00000000||You the ones destroying shrines all over Velen?
    404887|00000000||What's that got to do with you?
    503128|00000000||What's it got to do with you?
    503130|00000000||We are the heralds of lightning, heavy drops from leaden clouds! Unleashed, the lightning's name shall be Overman!
    581479|00000000||Bernard Tulle and Madame Sasha.
    581478|00000000||Finneas and Harald Featherbuns. Achoo!
    581480|00000000||We wish you a pleasant match. May fortune smile on you always.
    581475|00000000||Madame Sasha and Gilbert of Rivia.
    581470|00000000||Time for round two. Your attention, please!
    594629|00000000||I'm but a poor little woman!
   1032826|00000000||I saw you at the Chameleon! You're Master Dandelion's chum, aren't you?!
    594631|00000000||By the Prophet's wounds… a witcher!
    594633|00000000||Like stars o'er the highroad, your eyes…
    512526|00000000||Bravo! Ploughin' scragged 'em up thorough.
    547588|00000000||They told me a true bruiser'd come to the arena. Would you believe it? They were right!
    514361|00000000||Thanks.
    514363|00000000||Cyprian Wily, known to most as Whoreson Junior, appreciates good handiwork.
    514359|00000000||Thanks.
    514325|00000000||Who are you?
    514327|00000000||Thanks. I'd like to know who's congratulating me.
    514329|00000000||Heheh, slow, ain't ya?
    514388|00000000||Came here to end me, and you've no notion what I look like?
    547590|00000000||Well, we've nattered enough. Now--
    512529|00000000||Cleaver's dwarves are in the sewers! They've slaughtered the guards!
    512530|00000000||Don't stand there like a soddin' prick at a wedding! Muster the men and get at those midgets!
    512531|00000000||And would someone please kill the blasted witcher?
    512532|00000000||You heard the man. Kill him!
   1004410|00000000||Then the lord came out to them and said…
   1004411|00000000||Tree bark and green moss - sup on them, you'll live!
   1004412|00000000||Your sobbin', whinin' - it's killed me appetite! Now begone!
   1004413|00000000||So the lord went back to his feast, drank and gorged hisself to sleep.
   1004414|00000000||But he were a bad man, and an ill fate befell 'im.
   1004415|00000000||Because the gods are just.
    466590|00000000||You! Mans! Here Redania camp army. No cross. No boat steal!
    466592|00000000||Redanian army? Where're you hiding them?
    466594|00000000||It… it here, me. No see mans? Join me King Ravodid army. Order got - guard boatses.
    466596|00000000||Hm, boats're in pretty bad shape.
    466598|00000000||Me guard boats, Reds say… But no wood for to make… uh… fence. There boats, aye. So me fence make of boats… Boats guard boats!
    466650|00000000||Fine. I'll try to find some paint for you.
    466652|00000000||Good mans. Redaniarmy no service forget.
    466642|00000000||Fine, I'll bring you some paint.
    466658|00000000||Don't have the time right now. But if I come into any paint, I'll be sure to bring it to you.
    466644|00000000||Don't have the time.
   1016257|00000000||Got some paint for you.
   1016258|00000000||Just so happens I have some paint on me.
   1016284|00000000||Oh oh oh! Uh… ohhh. Owww.
    466685|00000000||Guess I can give it a shot. Got a brush?
    466584|00000000||I can try.
    466687|00000000||Know what? You're the Redanian soldier. You should paint it.
    466689|00000000||Yaahh… Try I. Mans no go, mans watch.
    466586|00000000||It's better if you do it.
    466672|00000000||What's the matter?
    466674|00000000||Has paint…  but… how dunno.
    466676|00000000||Hm, might be a problem.
    466678|00000000||Mans how know? I order! Mans knows!
    466680|00000000||I guess I do…. Depends what.
    466682|00000000||Birdo colory. Redania birdo. Shields like.
   1016286|00000000||Got some paint for you.
   1016288|00000000||Mans colory brings! But… ohhh….
    466561|00000000||Got some paint for you.
    466578|00000000||Good job. King Radovid'd be proud.
    466580|00000000||All tell him I when he come.
    466550|00000000||So long.
    466548|00000000||Who recruited you?
    466606|00000000||Why'd you join the army? Someone recruit you?
    466608|00000000||Crude? No crude…. Come good soldiermans. Say chargyman: watch boats! Peasanters they steals peasanter boats…. Puzzler trollololo, dunno…
    468788|00000000||Think I do: Redanians seized some peasants' boats. Thought the peasants might try to take them back. What happened next?
    468790|00000000||Chargyman go, soldiermans drink. And sing. LOTS sing. Listen troll. Boff! Come peasanters. Swing sharpy-sticks.
    468794|00000000||I help want army. Runner to, runner. Holla peasanters, holla soldiermans. Gentle, move them apart. But all lie down. Soldiermans too.
    468800|00000000||But order had me - watch boats. And watch I. Trollololo soldierman now. Trollololo sing too. You for sing you?
    466610|00000000||No, thanks, heard you earlier… But listen - where are the bodies? Don't see any…
    466622|00000000||Hungry go. Should no waste? Peasanters - good food. Soldierman friends - no so good. Big stew - always good.
    466660|00000000||A man-eating troll this near a city. Pretty dangerous…
    468823|00000000||Trollololo so pretty sing... for you… Mans ingrate… Shell tough, too. Crack 'fore to soup make. Take long - blech.
    466576|00000000||Eating soldiers - makes you dangerous.
    466574|00000000||Got it. Wartime rules.
    466630|00000000||Guess I understand. Wartime rules.
    466632|00000000||Mans soldierman too?
    466634|00000000||Uh… no.
    466636|00000000||Trollololo makes mans soldierman! Trollo chargyman, say: bring paint, and man brings paint.
    466638|00000000||Uh, paint? What're we talking about?
    466640|00000000||Paint, paint. Red colory, white colory. City gots. No city go. Trollololo watch boats.
    466604|00000000||Private Slate. Report on order.
    458125|fa6076ab||Herbalist
    418671|00000000||Does she sleep?
    418673|00000000||Like a lamb.
    418675|00000000||Come, sisters, no point in dawdling. The table's set, the cauldron bubbles.
    418677|00000000||We cannot! You know she is meant for Him!
    418679|00000000||Imlerith will get her, he will. But not whole.
    418681|00000000||Well said. We'll just have a sample.
    418683|00000000||I'll take her feet. Lovely, hmhm, plump. Perfect for a broth.
    418685|00000000||Oooo, I can taste it already… Very well. Get on with it!
    418694|00000000||Oh, you'll regret that, girl, regret it dearly.
    416577|00000000||We knew someone special was to arrive. We read beast entrails, saw the omens.
    416579|00000000||We would glimpse her likeness, a mirage in a puddle.
    416581|00000000||She came from the lower swamp.
    419459|00000000||We knew not at first it was her the omens had spoken of.
    419461|00000000||A child of the Elder Blood. The Sown Seed that will burst into flame…
    419463|00000000||She fell into our hands.
    374360|00000000||Elder Blood…
    374362|00000000||Mmm, the blood of the Traitoress.
   1016512|00000000||It was Hubert. You were right not to trust him. He was a higher vampire.
   1016516|00000000||I thought nothing could surprise me in Novigrad… Seems I was wrong. Deeply wrong.
   1016518|00000000||Thank you, Geralt. Were it not for you, this would never have ceased.
   1016514|00000000||It was Nathaniel. Caught him red-handed at Kate's - he was just about to cut into his next victim. Innkeeper wanted to keep me out. "Important customer," he said.
   1016510|00000000||Found and killed the murderer.
    342623|00000000||Found the murderer.
   1051236|00000000||Bad news - saw another victim. Turns out Nathaniel wasn't the murderer.
   1051238|00000000||Blast it. Did you gather any new clues?
   1051240|00000000||No. Crime scene was completely clean. No prints, no blood, not even a hair. Murderer's learning from his or her mistakes.
   1051242|00000000||We've but one recourse under the circumstances - caution. Looking out for ourselves and our loves ones.
   1051234|00000000||Made a mistake. Nathaniel wasn't the murderer.
   1069077|00000000||These murders - got any suspects?
   1069079|00000000||No, Geralt. Though all in all I should have.
   1069081|00000000||What do you mean?
   1069083|00000000||By virtue of my profession, I know Novigrad's underworld better than most. Dozens of mercenaries, racketeers, bandits and hired assassins have had their turn on my operating table. Rogues, one and all.
   1069085|00000000||But I believe even they could not kill in this manner - so horribly cruel, yet cold, methodical, with absolute precision.
   1069087|00000000||Concluding this overlong explanation, I've no notion who's behind it, but I fear them like hell.
   1069075|00000000||These murders - got any suspects?
   1016504|00000000||Why's the university in Oxenfurt closed?
   1016506|00000000||Because it suits Radovid. You've not heard the story?
   1016508|00000000||The rector wished to grant him an honorary doctorate. The faculty disagreed. Nonetheless, Radovid arrived for the ceremony, donned a gown, collected his diploma… and when it was over, imprisoned the deans and the entire academic senate - so they "wouldn't raise a stink."
   1070881|00000000||I've been at Vilmerius Hospital ever since. But perhaps it's for the best. I'm far more adept scalpel in hand than I ever was behind a lectern.
    342621|00000000||Why's the university in Oxenfurt closed?
   1070883|00000000||Know another surgeon from Oxenfurt Academy. Her name's Shani. Know her? Red hair cropped short, freckles…
   1070885|00000000||…and a hopeless idealist. Naturally, I know her. She was my assistant for a year.
   1070887|00000000||Any idea where she is now?
   1070889|00000000||My gut tells me she's somewhere along the front, patching up pikemen. I told her it would be futile. In the time she saved a hundred lives, another thousand would be lost. But medics with a mission - you can't argue with them.
   1070878|00000000||Happen to know a woman named Shani?
   1016491|00000000||Farewell.
    342625|00000000||Farewell.
    342619|00000000||The coroner told me about your past.
   1016488|00000000||Hubert told me about your past. Even more vivid than I'd assumed.
   1016489|00000000||I've not time for riddles, Geralt. Be straight or begone.
   1016496|00000000||Any truth to his claim that people died during the riots at the university? Died for your cause?
   1016498|00000000||I was young and stupid… I thought a better future was worth any price, even a human life or two. But those are past sins, sins I've atoned for.
   1016493|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
    525463|00000000||No need.
    525469|00000000||No need. Glad I could help.
    525471|00000000||See you later.
    525481|00000000||Thanks for everything. See you, Triss.
    525483|00000000||Mhm. See you.
    525485|00000000||How do I find you if I need you…?
    525498|00000000||I live in the Bits. Head up the hill past the fish market. Stop by.
    525500|00000000||Be seeing you.
    525473|00000000||It was nice to see you again.
    525475|00000000||You too, Geralt.
    525477|00000000||You should go now, before Corinne goes back into hiding somewhere.
    525479|00000000||What if I want to find you?
    525494|00000000||I live in the Bits, near the fish market. Stop by. It'd be nice.
    525496|00000000||All right - see you later.
    525470|00000000||Nice seeing you again.
    501359|00000000||There's an oneiromancer in town - Corinne Tilly. Very capable, supposedly.
    501363|00000000||Never trusted in dreamers' abilities myself.
    501365|00000000||Corinne's been very effective - you should at least try.
    501369|00000000||She's taken a job close by. Follow the canal, away from the fish market. The house is near the first bridge. Its owner, de Jonkheer, is a rich banker.
    515586|00000000||Not coming with me?
    515588|00000000||I've got some things to care of.
   1060320|00000000||Another rat-infested warehouse?
   1060322|00000000||Not exactly. Nothing even remotely satisfying. Such are the times.
    501371|00000000||You know, I've been thinking… who might know something about Ciri. And I just got an idea.
    525465|00000000||You should try to keep better company.
    525467|00000000||He was still better than some mages.
    525462|00000000||Should watch out for yourself.
   1063374|00000000||Don't kill me! Good sir, no… They forced me… Had I not told them, they'd have set fire to my home, my warehouse… The mage hunters know no mercy…
   1063376|00000000||Spare me, good man… Be not like those murderers.
    497536|00000000||Shut up. I should kill you. Thing is, you'd be no good to anyone but the gulls as a corpse. So you'll live and pay us double. Now.
    497537|00000000||Ff…. Fine… Your coin…
    501377|00000000||Now get!
    497538|00000000||Thanks, Geralt.
    496949|00000000||Wot? Down already?
    496948|00000000||At's it! Right in the razzo!
    418899|00000000||They left us! Look! All of 'em done went!
    418901|00000000||We've to swim. Come on.
    418903|00000000||What about all this? I can't leave it!
    444062|00000000||You go. Find a boat and come back for me… if you make it across.
    418909|00000000||Hah, why wouldn't I? Be back before you know it.
    536410|00000000||If you don't, I'll have to kick your faces in.
    536411|00000000||D'you hear that, lads?
    536384|00000000||I'll have to convince you.
    536431|00000000||This man's not worth your efforts. His shop's drowning in debt.
    536432|00000000||You're right. Even looks like a pauper.
    536434|00000000||I beg to differ!
    536436|00000000||Don't even know why I bothered the bugger. My apologies, and fare thee well.
    544370|00000000||I, uh, gotta go brush me teeth.
    536385|00000000||Come on, man's just not worth it.
   1010479|00000000||Least I tried…
    536439|00000000||Well, I tried. But all in all, it's not my problem.
    536386|00000000||Not my concern.
   1010481|00000000||Call me an admirer of law and order.
   1010483|00000000||Made a mistake comin' to this town, then.
   1010485|00000000||You're making the mistake. Leave him alone.
   1010487|00000000||And if we don't?
   1010478|00000000||Try concerned citizen.
    536370|00000000||Leave him alone.
    536371|00000000||And who might you be? Temple Guard, undercover?
    504549|ad8b31c5||Bookie
   1073770|00000000||Later, Geralt.
   1000625|00000000||The mask.
   1000637|00000000||The mask - dead giveaway.
   1000639|00000000||Hahaha. Perfect, right? Could take it off and no one would know the difference. Hahaha,
   1000645|00000000||Hey, Reuven.
   1000646|00000000||Look at that - my favorite accomplice. What's this, taking a day off from saving the world?
   1000641|00000000||Well, we've jested and laughed, but I've a sense you're in a hurry.
   1000649|00000000||Really?
   1000651|00000000||You know, Geralt, somehow I dislike running into you at parties.
   1000643|00000000||My bones start to ache, as if bad weather were approaching.
   1000627|00000000||Your voice - unmistakable.
   1000629|00000000||Oh yes, those famous witcher senses - finally getting some use out of them.
   1000631|00000000||And who's this creature with you? May I be introduced?
   1000633|00000000||Hey, Reuven.
   1000635|00000000||It can't be! Is that the lovely warble of my favorite accomplice?
   1000624|00000000||Your voice.
   1000616|00000000||A second chance! Ahahah! Good one! Cemeteries're full of men who thought Old Joel'd give them a second chance!
   1000620|00000000||Sigi, I'll be.
   1000622|00000000||Geralt! Damn it all, how'd you recognize me?
   1051379|00000000||{Vraag’va, alz esse pest aep an sheyse? } [Listen, that shite - what if we were to… infect ourselves?]
   1051381|00000000||{Coltais a yn reigmeid esse feldwebel, an reic palle aep pestaë... } [They say a lieutenant in one of the companies is selling infected pallets....]
   1051383|00000000||{Que ess garantie aep pest? } [Are they expensive? And can he guarantee we will catch it?]
   1051385|00000000||{Thaess aep, que'ss va! } [Quiet, someone's coming!]
   1051388|00000000||{Y esse’'vluchten aep heer? } [What if we were to slip away?]
   1051390|00000000||{Hwer esse vluchten’va? Esse aen hoael aep evell’caer. } [And go where? We're in the arse-end of nowhere.]
   1051392|00000000||{Externe kamp ge'erillan esse’rach va y beannan esse tuvea… } [Venture out of the camp and either guerillas will capture you or peasants will skewer you…]
   1051394|00000000||{Caen’va aep Pontar y esthuary...} [We could sail down the Pontar to its mouth…]
   1051396|00000000||{Gar'ean. Que'ss va a'ri.}[Careful. Someone's come round again.]
    547277|00000000||Fine. I'll see to it.
    547278|00000000||I'll not have it! Nonhumans - they stick together!
    547279|00000000||These two're like to prove it's no ghoul at all, but my dear departed nan!
    548424|00000000||I didnae get a good look at the mug, but now you mention it, it could very well be--
    548419|00000000||Shut it! Or I'll send inspectors to your storehouse just as soon as the monster's dispatched!
    547280|00000000||That won't be necessary.
    547275|00000000||I'll tend to it.
    547282|00000000||Sorry. Not interested.
    547283|00000000||Nonhuman - o' course! You always stick together! He might've discovered I was right, but now--
    547284|00000000||Now the captain'll decide what to do with yous. I've had it. Let's go!
    547276|00000000||Not interested.
    547268|00000000||What's the problem?
    547269|00000000||Fuck, another nonhuman! You're everywhere!
    547270|00000000||Silence! Now we'll do this quick. I've got a little witcher chore - you willin'?
    548280|00000000||Little chores aren't usually worth the pay.
    548281|00000000||Well this will be, don't you fret. Now just be quick about it - I've wasted enough time on these two pricks.
    548282|00000000||They share a warehouse. Monster's cropped up in it…
    547271|00000000||Cropped up? On its own? You put it there! You meant it to rip me noodle off, so you could get your paws on me goods!
    547272|00000000||Don't try to spin this, shorty!
    547273|00000000||I don't care who sicced a ghoul or a striga on who! Beast's gotta be dealt with - that's that.
    548283|00000000||So, what'll it be, witcher?
   1019024|00000000||So the notice about Jenny o' the Woods… you posted it, right?
   1019025|00000000||Ooh aye, 'twas me. You'd do it? You's a witcher, is you not? Straight off a picture in me granny's book.
   1019189|00000000||"Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers" - remember like it were today. We be afeared of her, but Jenny o' the Woods - what's she to you?
   1019007|00000000||You knew Zula and Bokhai?
   1019214|00000000||Zula and Bokhai - did you know them? They must've lived in this village.
   1019216|00000000||Good gods, ye knows? 'Tis witchery. They disappeared - both of them - into thin air. We've not seen 'em a week, now.
   1019041|00000000||I found the girl's grave and a letter. It's clear she rejected Bokhai because she loved another…
   1019042|00000000||Zula and Ontan, aye. We thought they'd fled north to seek happiness there. Bokhai departed round the same time.
   1019221|00000000||So, that's to mean our Zula's the wraith. Can't be. Such a good lass, and so pretty.
   1019043|00000000||Any idea where they used to meet?
   1019044|00000000||Hm, well, can't say for sure. But the young 'uns, they go to the clearin', mostly, west of the village, past the fields. Zula… Good gods…
   1019033|00000000||I'm on it. Know if anyone's seen Jenny o' the Woods, could tell me more about her?
   1019034|00000000||Ol' Willem must've. But he won't tell you naught. He were weak of heart. We found him in the fields this mornin'.
   1019201|00000000||Other folk are afeared to go out nights. But you might try Agneta - lives at the end of the village. Word is she saw the wraith.
   1019203|00000000||And nothing happened to her? She wasn't hurt?
   1019209|00000000||Agneta? Outlived three husbands, that one. Jenny o' the Woods won't do naught to that wench.
   1042582|00000000||I'll tend to this.
   1019171|00000000||Farewell.
   1019008|00000000||Got rid of Jenny o'the Woods.
   1019021|00000000||Jenny o' the Woods is gone. Got rid of her.
   1019022|00000000||Phew… She'll not be back?
   1019023|00000000||No. I know how to dispatch nightwraiths for good.
   1019251|00000000||Aye, of course. Your reward, as agreed. Many thanks to ye, master witcher.
   1019009|00000000||So long.
   1042586|00000000||Sorry, don't have the time for this.
   1042584|00000000||Don't have time to take this on.
   1042583|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1042594|00000000||Let's talk rewards.
   1072545|00000000||Hm, aye… So, how much would ye wish?
   1067302|00000000||Oh no, ye don't. That's far too dear.
   1067304|00000000||Well, sounds right for Jenny o'the Woods, but we're just short. Will ye drop it a bit?
   1067308|00000000||Is that what ye want? To benefit off 'uman misery? Ye'll take what's offered, or I'll find me another witchman!
   1067306|00000000||Oh, have it your way!
   1042588|00000000||About that contract…
   1042590|00000000||Changed your mind, have ye?
   1019006|00000000||Here about the notice - Jenny o' the Woods…?
   1019004|00000000||Greetings.
   1019005|00000000||What do ye want?
   1011374|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1011346|00000000||That's just bollocks.
   1011344|00000000||Fuck you.
   1011342|00000000||Aaaargh!
    358323|00000000||You're lying.
    358335|00000000||Go on lying like that and you won't get a thing.
    358337|00000000||I swear it! Honest as a child, I am, m'lord.
    422653|00000000||I know you pay tribute to the King of Beggars. Don't have a choice.
    354571|00000000||Sorry, no deal.
    422661|00000000||You didn't tell me anything.
    422663|00000000||I don't know nothin'. On your way - I've no use for you.
    354573|00000000||There. Now tell me where the Putrid Grove is. It's the least you could do.
    354575|00000000||I don't know and believe you me - I don't wanna know. Gods protect.
    354569|00000000||Fine, I'll pay.
    381274|00000000||Far as I'm concerned, the King of Beggars can stick his crown up his arse then shove it even deeper with his scepter. Bugger won't get a broken copper from me!
    422655|00000000||You're either pretty damn brave… Or just plain stupid.
    422657|00000000||What's he gonna do? Break me legs? Let him! Me takings double as a cripple.
    427082|00000000||From what I hear, they'd break your legs just to start…
    422659|00000000||Some coin for me future widow, then?
    358325|00000000||I think you take them to the Putrid Grove.
    358321|00000000||She live in the Putrid Grove?
    430717|00000000||So long.
    430715|00000000||Farewell.
    381272|00000000||Look kindly on a wretched soul, aid one who last saw nourishment three days past?
    358317|00000000||All right. Give you a crown.
    358319|00000000||Crown's enough, m'lord, when your gut's so empty it's stuck flat to your spine.
    422649|00000000||Could give you more, on one condition - you tell me where you drop your takings for the day.
    422651|00000000||I drop 'em with m'lady. Serious trouble if I didn't.
   1075588|00000000||You must still defeat Georgius Georg. Don't expect an easy fight.
    542236|00000000||You've two other local champions to choose from - Piledriver and Captain Mortimer of the Temple Guard. And here's your prize.
   1075590|00000000||Well… If you yearn to fight some more, you must certainly face the captain of the Guard.
    506001|00000000||Durden the Tailor… Fights every night in the outskirts, where the nonhumans have settled.
    504898|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! We’ve a new champion, the man who dethroned Archibald O'Neill! Bravo to Geralt! A beautiful bout!
    504899|00000000||Wanna be crowned the best in Novigrad. Who do I gotta fight?
    504902|00000000||Archibald O'Neill defeats the witcher!
   1071161|00000000||Kept in there until the end.
   1071163|00000000||What a shitty way to die.
   1016932|00000000||He's been here before. I remember him.
   1018084|00000000||What'd he want?
   1018086|00000000||Snoopin'.
   1016710|00000000||I'll be back.
   1016707|00000000||I'll be back.
   1016706|00000000||Didn't know him to be a god-fearing man.
   1016708|00000000||He's praying? Wouldn't have thought him a god-fearing man from what I've heard about him.
   1016709|00000000||Hm. Yet it's not somethin' that would surprise any man who knows him.
   1016705|00000000||Another snoop! You know the drill!
   1016702|00000000||Hey! That's the one killed our lads!
   1018062|00000000||Whaddaya want?
   1018064|00000000||I'm looking for Hammond.
   1018066|00000000||What for?
   1018068|00000000||Business.
   1016700|00000000||He prays at the chapel on the hill this time of day. If it's slaves you're lookin' to buy, you'll have to wait till he's done.
   1016704|00000000||I don't like you. Wait outside the gate.
   1039477|00000000||Thanks. Don't know how I'll repay you.
   1041902|00000000||Natalis card'll do just fine.
   1041912|00000000||Oh, yeah… Maybe you'd prefer some other? Got a whole array you might like--
   1041914|00000000||I'm in a hurry.
   1041915|00000000||The Natalis card.'Course. Here.
    472524|00000000||I'll pay you to go.
    472538|00000000||Maybe we can make a deal.
    472540|00000000||We'll not ploughin' bargain with no one. Vengeance, that's what we want!
    472516|00000000||What do you want from the pellar?
    472520|00000000||What do you want from him?
    472522|00000000||To give 'im what he deserves.
    472686|00000000||And that is?
    472688|00000000||He done conjured auguries. Said something evil had made its nest in Edric's bowels. Told Edric to eat rowanberries, lots of 'em!
    472726|00000000||Ever since, Edric's lived in the outhouse, and he's got hardened pustules all over him!
    472510|00000000||What do you want?
    472512|00000000||Wanna talk to the pellar.
    472514|00000000||Too late. We've got dibs on a chat with 'im. A long one.
    472550|00000000||Think you need to leave now.
    472552|00000000||Do we?
    472758|00000000||You do.
    472554|00000000||Well… let's go, then.
    472546|00000000||You need to leave.
    475690|00000000||Who the 'ell do you think you are?
    475692|00000000||A witcher.
    475694|00000000||A witcher?
    475708|00000000||Hear that, boys? Either Velen's got a bumper crop of witchers, or this is the bastard who cut down our boys at the Crossroads.
    472560|00000000||Get the hell out. Now.
    472562|00000000||Heheheh… And here I thought we'd have a day without corpses.
    475710|00000000||Heard mages pay top coin for the special bits of rare creatures.
    475712|00000000||Wonder 'ow much we'll get for his eyes.
    472558|00000000||Leave or die.
    472536|00000000||Tell you what - you leave, and I'll heal Edric.
    472732|00000000||Just so happens I need the pellar alive. So if you agree to leave him alone, for good, I'm willing to tell you how to help Edric.
    475678|00000000||Hmmm… well, all in all…
    475680|00000000||Yes or no?
    475682|00000000||Fine. Let's hear it.
    475684|00000000||A tea of mullein leaves for his belly, and cover his boils with mallow. A few days and he'll be good as new.
    475686|00000000||Noted. But if it don't work, we'll be back.
    475688|00000000||Move out, boys!
   1073729|00000000||Any of yous know where this mullein shite grows?
   1073734|00000000||My old lady'll know. Got a knack for herbs, she does.
   1073738|00000000||The other shite, mallow, ought to have that, too. Chops it, adds it to our milker's feed.
   1073740|00000000||Heheheh, Edric's dumb as your milker. Should suit 'im.
   1074062|00000000||All right. Let's get Edric, pull 'im outta the shitter, stuff 'im full of herbs and see if he get's well.
   1073742|00000000||And if he don't?
   1073744|00000000||We'll visit the pellar one last time.
   1073746|00000000||We gotta go…
   1073748|00000000||Aye, we oughta…
   1073750|00000000||But where'll we go?
   1073752|00000000||Away from here…
    472579|00000000||Arrrgh!
    472581|00000000||Stand still, dammit!
    171353|39b3095b||Redanian Soldier
   1042556|00000000||Agh, ugh, leave me… Swiving drowners.
   1021510|00000000||You could use a witcher.
   1042558|00000000||Ha ha. Highly amusing. If… if I give you the coin, will you leave me be?
   1021653|00000000||No. Rather make sure this was our last meeting.
   1041895|00000000||No.
   1021652|00000000||Yeah. You can go… if you're able.
   1042569|00000000||Hah… What're my chances? With these wounds?
   1042571|00000000||Not high. So long.
   1041896|00000000||Yeah. You can go.
   1042565|00000000||Ugh. First Earl - ha… Now it's my turn, is that it?
   1020656|00000000||Gimme the coin.
   1042567|00000000||And then, ugh… then you'll leave me be?
   1074378|00000000||Strange bones… Don't seem human to me.
    499676|00000000||You're a flappin' cunt, old man, naught more.
    499675|00000000||Gray old vagrant, but you got a fist of stone.
    530520|00000000||Call that a punch? Hargh!
    530519|00000000||Move your arse, grey hair.
    529444|00000000||Fuck you up? Fuck you up!
    349468|c1769c44||Nekker
    452710|80f5373b||Deserter
    370123|00000000||Hands you been gettin'… Mmm.
    370125|00000000||Heheh… I believe I ought to quit the table… Time's come.
    370127|00000000||But darling! It's your lucky day!
    467804|00000000||Better safe than sorry.
    467810|00000000||Might be right… But these days, better safe than sorry. Take care of yourself.
    467806|00000000||Mhm. Forgot… Could've managed it on your own. Well, don't let me get in your way. Farewell.
    467802|00000000||Forgot… could've handled it yourself.
    467766|00000000||Here it is… Really, you needn't have troubled yourself.
    393237|00000000||A bit further, follow me.
    394100|00000000||Here's the spot.
   1013060|00000000||Words cannot express how sorry I am about the incident!
   1013061|00000000||It was a bit of a lark, a jest. We meant to bring it all back. I swear!
    465727|00000000||I'll pay you… Anythin' you want, just spare her, I beg you!
    465725|00000000||Noooo! Leave her be, you bastards!
    449565|00000000||Actually, I see a few monsters…
    449567|00000000||Where?!
    449569|00000000||Dremmy, dammit, dumber than a hunk o' lard you are! He means us!
    458102|00000000||We're common folk. You're the mutant, the poxy freak! Get 'im, lads!
    449549|00000000||Actually see several monsters…
    449577|00000000||No. No monsters. But before I go - as I see it, you should all get an equal share of the loot.
    449581|00000000||Hear that? You're lookin' to make arses of us! A blind man could see it!
    458862|00000000||Enough of the chatter! I'm takin' the beads! And the bronze ring!
    449551|00000000||No monsters. So long.
    449559|00000000||Steal much?
    449563|00000000||See any monsters? Eh? Sod off, witcher, we've no need for you!
   1052199|00000000||Ehh… Borin' here, without the students.
   1052201|00000000||You miss the students? Whenever you saw one anywhere near the port you'd smack 'im head-side and toss 'im in the river!
   1052203|00000000||Exactly. Now it's borin'. Nothin' but loadin' and unloadin'. No diversions.
   1088450|00000000||Them scars - they a gift from a whore for you tryin' to shaft 'er?
   1088452|00000000||*Whistles*
   1088454|00000000||Life's shit sometimes.
   1088456|00000000||You got somethin' up your nose? Somethin' white, maybe?
   1088458|00000000||Oy!
   1088460|00000000||Mummy!
    499036|00000000||Officer! Takin' a rest from witch hunting? Greetings, Your Honor - good to see you again.
    499037|00000000||Bring us the usual.
    499038|00000000||Course. Keep this up and you'll earn yourselves a preferential rate.
    499039|00000000||Good, I enjoy shagging freaks. And three-titted wenches are banned in normal brothels.
    400636|00000000||They call you Voytek?
    400638|00000000||I… I… They do, kind sir, but I's not done a thing. Swear it on the lives of my young 'uns!
    400589|00000000||No need to be afraid, little guy. I'm not gonna hurt you. Which woman was it - older or younger?
    177974|00000000||The pretty young one, does the medicines - she came that night. She was tired, breathin' hard. Mummy gave her something to drink.
    400689|00000000||What happened next?
    401316|00000000||Fine, what happened next?
    401326|00000000||Grew even darker, seemed someone 'ad put out the stars. Crickets all went silent of a sudden, and then, from the woods, a roar.
    401341|00000000||Broke out in a cold sweat, and before I could catch my breath a beast jumped out o' the woods - big as a barn, with horns and two burning coals for eyes!
    401343|00000000||I thought I was done for! Beast attacked Missus Anna's horse, ripped its head off! Carried her off into the woods!
    401369|00000000||Our horses, mine and Miss Tamara's, got spooked and tore off willy-nilly. 'Twere the only reason we escaped!
    401371|00000000||The miss wanted to go back for her mother, but my wife pleaded, said she'd die out there alone. Miss Tamara agreed not to go.
    401266|00000000||What happened next?
    401246|00000000||Why did you help them?
    371285|00000000||Why help them at all? You risked a lot.
    371287|00000000||I'd a debt, owed Miss Tamara. Three moons past a fever gripped my boy. We thought he was done for.
    371289|00000000||Tamara learnt it, brought food and salves. We're poorer than dirt itself… She saved my boy, no two ways about it.
    414077|00000000||Me, myself, I'd a never dared to help. But my missus told me, "A time of war and contempt's come, a time of folk gone wrong. We needs to repay good with good. Who stands by idly does evil as if."
    414079|00000000||Married a wise woman.
    371331|00000000||Cryin' shame we couldn't save Missus Anna in the end.
    401268|00000000||Why did you help them?
    401248|00000000||Thanks for the help.
    360071|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    360073|00000000||The lady - she'll be all right in the end, won't she?
    360089|00000000||I'll do what I can to see that she is.
    401270|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    401264|00000000||Tell me about these marks.
    401276|00000000||What marks?
    401280|00000000||They's… well… like burned on with hot iron… on the palms, inside.
    401282|00000000||Burned? Like a cattle brand?
    401284|00000000||Aye, though these wasn't black scars, scabbed over. They's hot and glowin' as if they burned with raw fire.
    401244|00000000||Tell me about these marks.
    400687|00000000||I know where Anna is.
    390439|00000000||While back I met a woman in Crookback Bog. Had fiery marks on her skin like the ones you described.
    401302|00000000||Must be her! Missus Anna! Gods… she to Crookback Bog…
    401304|00000000||It's where I saw her last.
    390453|00000000||Gods of all the heavens protect us… 'Tis clear now whose whisper 'twere in the night.
    401306|00000000||It is?
    401308|00000000||The Crones took her! She must've made a deal with 'em, a pact! It's why they marked her and took her like she was their own.
    371119|00000000||What happened to Tamara's mother?
    371125|00000000||Ach. 'Twere like this - I was awaitin' in the old smokehouse, with horses. Cold as hell and so dark, couldn't see past two ells in front of ye.
    400684|00000000||Moon 'ad arisen high, and still they hadn't come. Began to fear some demon 'ad snatched 'em. But finally they came forth, and we sets off towards the river.
    371221|00000000||Suddenly, out of nowhere a gale arose. Thought it'd tear my head off! And those damned birds! Swarms of 'em coursin' o'er the woods, raisin' a racket to make your ears bleed!
    371685|00000000||Missus Anna screamed, bent over into herself. Tamara knelt down, gripped her arms. 'Twere then I saw it - fiery marks on her hands.
    371117|00000000||Where is the baron's wife?
    360033|00000000||Where'd the girl go? Your son's said enough, no point in playing dumb anymore.
    360042|00000000||Sorry, sir, but ye don't look like one of her father's men.
    371693|00000000||Because I'm not. I'm looking for Tamara and her mother, I need to know if they're alive and safe.
    371695|00000000||Tamara is, aye. She's to my brother's place in Oxenfurt. But Missus Anna - that's another tale…
    360067|00000000||Though anywhere's better than to Crow's Perch… with the baron.
    400680|00000000||Why?
    400682|00000000||Cause… 'cause he beat her, sir. Beat Missus Anna, I means. Everyone knew! But not a one lifted a finger for to stop it.
    360031|00000000||Girl who stayed with you - what happened to her?
    177966|00000000||Who'd you see? Describe her.
    400593|00000000||I want to help that woman. She could be in danger.
    400591|00000000||Young 'un's seen no one, m'lord. He's a kiddie, must 'ave dreamt it.
    400601|00000000||I wanna hear this dream, then.
    400597|00000000||So, kid, who did you see? Who came here?
    359920|00000000||Pappy brought 'er at night, the lady does the medicines. She was all afeared. Talked about an awful monster, said she had to go back. Don't know where to.
    371259|00000000||Mummy and pappy cheered 'er up, gave 'er clothes. Hers were ragged.
    177901|00000000||Just need information. Looking for two women - the Bloody Baron's wife and daughter.
    359850|00000000||Not a soul abeen here, sir.
    359848|00000000||Sure? Not even passing through? Daughter's medium height, about twenty, her mother's thin, about forty. Seen them?
    177941|00000000||That's her came at night, right, mummy?
    177943|00000000||Quiet, boy!
    420283|00000000||Who's that?
    420285|00000000||Other room. Go on, now.
    400634|00000000||What ye seek here, sir? Our hut's out of the way, woeful. We 'as nothin', we knows nothin'.
    400599|00000000||Tell me everything you remember.
   1051217|5755c467||Whoreson's Henchman
   1052419|00000000||Fabric from the distant south, you'll not find it anywhere else!
   1052421|00000000||Just how far south does this fabric come from?
   1052423|00000000||The latest cuts and colors.
   1052425|00000000||You didn't answer the question.
   1052427|00000000||I'll answer it. From very far south indeed. From a land called Nilfgaard.
   1052429|00000000||And what's wrong with that?
   1052431|00000000||What's wrong is my coin would go to help those imperial scoundrels!
   1004710|00000000||What if someone took 'em? Is holdin' 'em captive in some musty hut in the woods?
   1004711|00000000||Must be sufferin', both.
   1004712|00000000||Aye, they were fed naught but soufflés and quail at Crow's Perch.
   1004713|00000000||Now the discomfort of some hut… Knocked down to live like ordinary folk… at last.
   1004714|00000000||From shite they came, in shite they'll rot. My man's just as much a noble as that baron.
    564301|00000000||A witcher? Ohh! Step over here!
    181343|00000000||Star-crossed lovers.

   1020726|00000000||My regards.
   1020728|00000000||Any news from Temeria, traveler?
   1020751|00000000||Mhm?
   1020608|00000000||Even the rain smells different here.
   1023316|00000000||Stop, please…
   1020753|00000000||Down with war! Down with violence!
   1020755|00000000||Help!
   1020731|00000000||What's this?!
   1023318|00000000||All of 'em! They looted all Vizima's treasures! Gold, jewels, paintings, candlesticks…
   1023320|00000000||They fattened themselves on our capital, oh yes, ate their fill… Invaders.
   1020737|00000000||May tomorrow be better than yesterday.
   1020735|00000000||What woe it is to wander foreign lands…
   1020733|00000000||Naught for work, naught to eat.
    589909|00000000||Aahahaaaa! I'm a kraken! Urrraaah!
    589910|00000000||My, is he ever sotted…
    589911|00000000||Please, young master! You'll catch cold!
    589912|00000000||Stop whining and bring us shrimp and a trumpet!
    176898|00000000||I'm a friend of Dandelion's. Looking for Elihal.
    176900|00000000||You've come to the right spot. How might I be of service? Need something shortened? Patch your trousers, darn your socks?
    176902|00000000||You Elihal?
    416847|00000000||Yes. Now pick your jaw up off the floor.
    416849|00000000||Sorry, I thought… thought Elihal was one of Dandelion's girlfriends.
    432570|00000000||Ahhh, so it's that. Wait here.
    176906|00000000||Any better?
    361219|00000000||So you're…
    361221|00000000||Elihal.
    176908|00000000||Did you and Dandelion… I mean - how'd you two meet?
    186580|00000000||I met him one night in a tavern. He was blind drunk…
    355196|00000000||Don't think I wanna know what happened next…
    355219|00000000||Oh, stop. He wasn't so drunk as not to figure it out.
    501191|00000000||Besides, men don't interest me. I told him that from the start.
    355192|00000000||Don't want to know the rest.
    355190|00000000||And then?
    355194|00000000||What happened?
    355213|00000000||What do you think? We spoke.
    501187|00000000||That's it?
    501189|00000000||I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I should make one thing clear - men don't interest me. Told him that as well.
    355227|00000000||Luckily Dandelion's an open-minded fellow. We had a lovely evening. He became a loyal customer afterwards.
    419909|00000000||Why do you dress that way?
    419911|00000000||I know this is none of my business, but why do you…
    419917|00000000||Why do I dress up? As a child, I dreamt of becoming a doppler when I grew up.
    419919|00000000||I became a tailor instead… Discovered clothing, costumes can express all the complexities of one's personality.
    501476|00000000||I'm a Redanian countess one day, a dockside thug the next. That is true freedom!
    420920|00000000||Mhm...
    419923|00000000||Have you never thought to become someone else - even for a moment? Must be horribly boring being a witcher all the time.
    419925|00000000||I manage to stay interested.
    498934|00000000||When'd you last see Dandelion?
    186662|00000000||Dandelion visit your shop often?
    427316|00000000||I tried many times to talk him into a decent doublet. Sadly he'd only come in to get a button re-affixed or a hole patched…
    427318|00000000||When'd you last see him?
    186666|00000000||Some time ago… He brought in one of Zoltan's jerkins, insisted I sew on an extra pocket.
    427314|00000000||Odd as requests go. I had the distinct feeling he'd actually come to talk.
    186644|00000000||What did you and Dandelion talk about?
    499049|00000000||What did you and Dandelion talk about? He ask about anything in particular?
    499050|00000000||Hmm… Let me think… Had an ordinary chat, really. Although… indeed, he did keep asking about Kalkstein.
    501516|00000000||If Dandelion and I hadn't laid our cards on the table at the start, I might have suspected he had a history with the alchemist. He spoke like a lovesick beau.
    501518|00000000||In fact, he desperately wished to meet with him.
    499059|00000000||Kalkstein's in Novigrad? Wouldn't mind seeing him myself.
    499061|00000000||You're too late, I fear. The witch hunters nabbed him recently, burned him at the stake in Hierarch Square…
    518091|00000000||But as he perished - ooo, the goings on! Impressive. Fiery beasts circled his pyre, then rose into the sky and exploded to form letters.
    518092|00000000||Really. What'd they spell?

    355204|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    355206|00000000||Thanks for your help. And... nice to meet you.
    355208|00000000||I can help with much more. If you need new trousers or a vest, you know where to find me.
   1052456|00000000||You've any strength left?
   1052458|00000000||Still kickin'. *Cough cough*
   1052460|00000000||Then come help. We've got bodies to bury…

    369845|00000000||Greetings.
    369851|00000000||Don't know you. Not lettin' you in. And don't you fucking stand there.
    414765|00000000||Hear me out. You'll wanna let me in.
    414775|00000000||I want my chance in the arena.
    414777|00000000||Come in.
    439827|00000000||Who's in charge?
    439829|00000000||Igor. They call him Hook.
    414781|00000000||What the bloody hell was that?
    452812|00000000||A bout of sudden sincerity.
    366821|00000000||I'll pay.
    366827|00000000||Sure we can't work this out?
    452740|00000000||How's that?
    452742|00000000||I pay you, you let me in.
    452744|00000000||Give it here.
    366829|00000000||Get in. And remember, we've an eye on you.
    439823|00000000||Who runs the fights?
    439825|00000000||Igor.
    407697|00000000||Don't you go wanderin'. Straight to Igor, now.
    407699|00000000||Fair enough.
    366831|00000000||Recognize this piece of paper?
    369863|00000000||A fight contract.
    369865|00000000||Good, you can read. So who's this contract made out to?
    369867|00000000||Says, uh, Zdenek. Made out to Zdenek.
    369869|00000000||Mhm. I'm Zdenek. Any more questions?
    366833|00000000||In you go.
    366823|00000000||My name's Zdenek and I have a contract.
    366866|00000000||Love to chat it up with doormen. In fact, often come to an agreement with them.
    369873|00000000||Thing is, I'm short on patience today. So either let me in, or I'll let myself in, over your dead bodies.
    366868|00000000||Oooh, hear the cockerel? Kickin' and standin' his comb on edge…
    369879|00000000||Cock a doodle do, what am I to do? Shit myself?
    369882|00000000||All right…
    452810|00000000||Go left!
    366858|00000000||Let me in or die.
    366870|00000000||Fair enough.
    366872|00000000||Oi! Beat it!
    366860|00000000||All right.
    366874|00000000||Oy! I'm talkin' to you! Y'understand human?! Get. The. Fuck. Out!
    415038|00000000||Gettin' on me nerves, you gray-haired knob. Piss off.
    415015|00000000||No passage. Don't linger, neither.
    498895|00000000||You heard? They raided Cleaver's house.
    498896|00000000||They kill him?
    500909|00000000||Don't be daft. Cleaver weren't born yesterday. War's on. Bugger kips down somewhere new every night.
    500911|00000000||Hmph. Whoreson's in for it now. Cleaver's spiteful - won't let it slide.
    500913|00000000||Whoreson gets ploughed up the arse, we'll be next, you know.
    500915|00000000||We had peace, peace was good. Who found it a fuckin' bother?
   1049787|6c3c7e75||Wyvern
   1052501|00000000||At first I thought it a jest… but then yesterday this imp robbed me, too!
   1052503|00000000||Teach you to make light of others' misfortune! So what'd it take?
   1052505|00000000||A bushel of apples.
   1052507|00000000||Not so bad, then.
   1052509|00000000||It is bad! I'd hidden a smuggled bottle of the finest Toussaint at the bottom!

    172329|52a3f146||Peasant
   1070977|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
   1070979|00000000||Came with the army, of course. Its remnants.
   1070982|00000000||When Nilfgaard crossed the Yaruga, I dropped everything, threw it all away to hell and rode for the front to fight the invader. Joined the 2nd Temerian Army under John Natalis. We were to stop the Black Ones' advance along the Dol Blathanna - Mount Carbon line.
   1070985|00000000||And we did. For three days. Then they smashed us into splinters.
   1070987|00000000||Soon after, I heard Radovid was assembling his forces near Novigrad. That he'd promised to fight for a free North. Broke through with the remains of Natalis' army, but…
   1070989|00000000||But?
   1070991|00000000||But Radovid proved no better than Emhyr. So I decided I would mount my own fight.
   1070903|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
    521997|00000000||So long.
   1070904|00000000||Take care.
   1070902|00000000||What do you do these days?
    499525|00000000||What do you do here? Hunt Scoia'tael?
    499529|00000000||You jest, right? Who cares about the Scoia'tael anymore.
    541126|00000000||Temeria – that's what matters.
    490828|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Safe and sound.
   1084608|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
   1084609|00000000||Take care.
   1084607|00000000||What do you do these days?
   1068657|00000000||Roche, I cannot abandon them. I--
   1068659|00000000||You can and must. Because those are your orders.
   1068661|00000000||They'll die. Please.
   1068663|00000000||We're done. Dismissed.
    490829|00000000||Vernon Roche. Temeria's last hope.
    490830|00000000||Laugh all you want. Temeria will rise again.
    354703|00000000||Mercy…
    354705|00000000||Get out of my way.
    358489|00000000||Let him through…
    358491|00000000||Thank you.
    569296|00000000||What's this one doin' here?
    569297|00000000||You stupid? Can't you see he's a witcher? Likely trackin' some beast.
    594775|00000000||Whoa there, ragpicker!
    594777|00000000||Stop starin', you'll jinx our work!
    594779|00000000||The sea's a-tossin', tossin'… And the wind keeps blowin' in', blowin'…
    401464|00000000||No worries. I'm going.
    401474|00000000||Calm down. I'm going.
    401476|00000000||Good idea. Go.
    454719|00000000||Listen, I…
    458390|00000000||Behind you!
    458392|00000000||If you think I'm gonna fall for… Oh, you fucker!
    401470|00000000||What're you doing?
    401472|00000000||What one does in the country… Harvestin'. Just switched from wheat fields to battlefields.
    458436|00000000||Corpses look fresh. Some of these men - still alive a bit ago, right?
    458438|00000000||Aye, they were. Wounded but breathin'. Healer could've helped 'em… But no healers around. Just us.
    458440|00000000||Yeah. Just thieves… and murderers.
    458442|00000000||You're ploughin' startin' to annoy me. And I don't like bein' annoyed.
    401466|00000000||What's going on here?
    401478|00000000||Not another step… Or there'll be one corpse more.
    538532|00000000||Yeah?
    539202|00000000||Craft special-order weapons, too?
    539204|00000000||Do politicians murder high-class prostitutes? 'Course!
    538534|00000000||Got this diagram. Think you can forge the weapon?
    538525|00000000||Would you craft something for me?
   1028793|00000000||Up for a few rounds of gwent?
   1086481|00000000||How about we play cards?
    538535|00000000||So long.
    538526|00000000||Farewell.
    538524|00000000||Show me what you got in stock.
    538533|00000000||I'll take a look. Maybe pick something.
    539295|00000000||Yeah?
   1039448|00000000||Farewell.
    544747|00000000||See you later.
    544749|00000000||I doubt it.
   1039450|00000000||One question - who buys your fisstech?
   1039452|00000000||Oh, friends in high places - I have many. They pay exceedingly well, though they're demanding as clients. The fisstech must be of the purest variety.
   1039454|00000000||Pleasure meeting you.
   1039447|00000000||Who buys your fisstech?
    531048|00000000||Well… That went better than I ever expected.
    531049|00000000||We done with our walk?
    531050|00000000||Yes. And here's your pouch.
   1019753|00000000||Ehh…
   1023298|00000000||Whoreson rode about, helpin', he said, givin' food to the hungry…
   1023300|00000000||But the vittles were pox-ridden! Ehh… Whether by sword or plague, they's always killin' peasants…
   1019755|00000000||Traitor.
   1020627|00000000||Ptooey.
   1020619|00000000||Saw you in Vizima. Imperial lackey.
   1034397|00000000||Paid traitor, Nilfgaard's lackey.
   1020629|00000000||Temeria will be free again. One day.
   1020617|00000000||Long live a free Temeria.
   1019757|00000000||Watch it.
   1020621|00000000||Don't hurt me! Aaaaah!
   1020625|00000000||Save yourselves!
   1020623|00000000||Good health to you.
   1023302|00000000||Gods…
    175355|db02e59d||La Valette Guard
   1011931|00000000||Remember the times? You'd barely pierce the thicket…
   1011933|00000000||And hear the chatter, see as many folk as you get at the market in Gors Velen.
   1011935|00000000||So it were. Coal gatherers, tar burners, bark collectors…
   1011937|00000000||Mushroom pickers.
   1011938|00000000||Little lasses takin' supper to their sick grans…
   1011939|00000000||Now? Who goes to the woods now? Not a soul, save those who seek death.
    530960|00000000||What's going on here?
    530968|00000000||What's going on here?
    530969|00000000||Oh. Listen, mind watering those cornflowers over there?
    530970|00000000||No cornflowers here.
    530971|00000000||Look harder.
    530961|00000000||Hurry it up.
    530972|00000000||Make it quick. I don't have all day.
    530973|00000000||Startin' to like this gardener of yours.
    530976|00000000||Don't care who owes who or how much. But this man is supposed to pay me, so I'd rather he not get fleeced.
    530977|00000000||Witcher or not, you can't hope to drop us all.
    530978|00000000||Wanna find out?
    530979|00000000||Peace brings prosperity, and strife's bad for business. Fine, make it four thousand. Let's go.
    530980|00000000||Pure pleasure doing business with you.
    530974|00000000||Right.
    530997|00000000||Wrong. This is between you two - I'm waiting to get paid.
    530998|00000000||Not willin' to meddle in other folks' business - pleased to hear it.
    530999|00000000||Don't let 'im get away.
   1071423|00000000||Wise choice.
   1071425|00000000||I'm not that sure. Just lost what I was due to be paid.
   1071427|00000000||Wrong on that count. We'll give you the same sum as this whoreson agreed to pay.
   1071429|00000000||But witcher!
    530975|00000000||Wrong.
    530962|00000000||Right, on with it before winter snows surprise us. Got four quarts for you now, and can get you another two real quick, provided you're not lyin' about demand.
    530963|00000000||I am Ginter de Lavirac and I never go back on my word. I had no trouble distributing the last four quarts and assure you there's demand for more.
    530964|00000000||We'll see 'bout that. For now, you owe me five thousand crowns for the last batch.
    530967|00000000||We agreed on four thousand, and I don't like cheats. I suggest you refrain from trying to pull anything lest you feel a witcher's blade in your gut.
    531613|00000000||Right?
    544556|00000000||…
    530959|00000000||[Wait.]
    530748|00000000||You're late.
    530749|00000000||I'm afraid I had some unexpected adventures along the way. However, we can now focus on our core concern, and that is what matters.
    530750|00000000||Who's the fellow followed you here?
    530751|00000000||He's my gardener. I never go anywhere without him. He's good luck, you see.
    530754|00000000||Just no funny stuff, got it?
    175619|ea15b01b||Innkeep
   1011327|00000000||This is what they call "lashing rain."
   1011325|00000000||Don't you have to be somewhere?
   1011323|00000000||What, shithead?
   1011319|00000000||Err!
   1011321|00000000||Ugh!
   1069946|00000000||Dammit… Gotta catch them.
   1033164|00000000||And it didn't surprise you the land was so cheap?! It's at the world's end!
   1033165|00000000||Watch what ye say, rotter! You're talkin' about me fatherland. Tuirseach!
   1033166|00000000||And you truly believe this the best site for a shoppe trading in imported wines and liquors?
   1033167|00000000||I wanted a forge…
   1033168|00000000||Shut it, van Hoorn! How were I to know they only drink their fuckin' mead?
   1033169|00000000||They're from fuckin' Skellige, for fuck's sake! Flavor means fuck all to them, all they want is to get fucked up.
   1033170|00000000||What the hell was I thinkin' makin' another deal with this scag?
   1033171|00000000||It's all your fault. Piss off!
   1033172|00000000||An Skellig, for fuck's sake.
   1018151|00000000||Must've been one of the players. Lowered the coin down on the line, then strolled past the guards.
   1018153|00000000||Hm, this was well prepared. Think you can track the culprit down?
   1018155|00000000||Don't know yet. Oughta look in the street, see if I can find anything there.
    452728|af91b76f||Ghoul
   1025221|00000000||Not a chance.
   1025225|00000000||Dandelion, this is not gonna work.
   1044763|00000000||It will, it will. You'll see.
   1044759|00000000||Pretty good, actually.
   1044761|00000000||Hm, this could actually work.
   1025229|00000000||Written your lines already.
   1025232|00000000||You've written what?
   1025237|00000000||So you know what to say during the performance. Here.
   1025233|00000000||And your mask. Put it on, Sophronia can't recognize you.
   1047641|00000000||But…
   1025627|00000000||No time! Sophronia's coming! Stick to the plan. We'll meet at the Rosemary in the morning!
   1025223|00000000||Are you serious? That's your brilliant plan?
   1044773|00000000||I never called it brilliant, but any kind of plan is better than none.
   1025220|00000000||That's it? That's your plan?
   1044770|00000000||Ah! Finally made it!
   1025171|00000000||Listen, here's the plan. Sophronia loves adventure-filled romance novels. I can be a hero in her eyes - if I can just save her from a bandit.
   1044775|00000000||I'll have her eating out of my hand. And there's no way she'll begrudge me that loan.
   1025173|00000000||Want me to be the bandit?
   1025174|00000000||Knew you'd see the sense in it right away.
    573081|00000000||House shouldn't give you any more trouble. A little renovation and it should be fit for you to move into.
    573082|00000000||Truly? Why, the estate's price just spiked sharply. What precisely was the problem?
    573083|00000000||Earth elemental trapped in the cellar. It was just trying to get out, almost demolished the house in the effort.
    573084|00000000||Hm, far more interesting than a ghost, that's certain. The cellar you mentioned - is it in a state to be furnished?
    573085|00000000||Hard to say.
    573086|00000000||We shall see. Ah, your bounty - there you are. And farewell.
    572396|00000000||Here to collect the reward.
   1067941|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1067948|00000000||Let's talk about my reward first.
   1072525|00000000||I beg your pardon? Asking for coin already? But you've not done the job.
   1072527|00000000||Need to make sure it's worth my time.
   1072537|00000000||Just look at that. Arrives in Novigrad and he's off his head in minutes.
   1072539|00000000||Very well, how much do you believe this should cost me?
   1067950|00000000||Ha, ha. That was rich. I could hire three witchers for that amount. Now that you've had your jest, how much?
   1067952|00000000||Hm… No. I'm afraid that's too much. But we're near a price I would consider reasonable.
   1067956|00000000||Do you jest?! I shall give you what I consider reasonable and not a copper more! Any other witcher would do it gratis!
   1067954|00000000||Yes. Agreed.
    573077|00000000||Fine. I'm willing to investigate. How do I get there?
    573078|00000000||An orchard adjoins the property. The house itself you should recognize easily - cracks cover its walls. Here's the key. And good luck.
   1067939|00000000||I'll tend to it.
   1067942|00000000||Farewell.
    573080|00000000||So long.
    572397|00000000||So long.
    572395|00000000||Kurt Dysart?
    573041|00000000||Count Kurt Dysart?
    573042|00000000||Are you here regarding the contract? Hmm…
    573043|00000000||Wanted to hire a witcher, didn't you?
    573044|00000000||I did. But not just any vagabond… One hears all manner of stories about the lunatics of the School of the Cat. Which do you belong to?
    573061|00000000||School of the Wolf.
    573062|00000000||Ah yes, a good one. I knew a witcher of this school. Barnabas? No… Though his name did begin with a B. Never mind. To the matter at hand.
    573045|00000000||School of the Wolf.
    573071|00000000||School of the Griffin.
    573072|00000000||Then why does a wolf hang from your neck?
    573073|00000000||Hard times - took whatever was available. Mind if we get down to business?
    573047|00000000||School of the Griffin.
    573046|00000000||Not your concern.
    573067|00000000||Not your concern… Lord Dysart. If you'd rather wait for another witcher, you're free to do that.
    573068|00000000||Hah! Calm and confident - this I like! To the matter at hand.
    573074|00000000||Not long past, I acquired an estate east of Novigrad. I got it on the cheap, you see, the seller was very keen to be rid of it.
    573075|00000000||Now I've learned the building is said to be haunted.
   1022123|00000000||Goes to explain the seller's urgency.
    573076|00000000||I do not believe in ghosts - it is that simple. But my men say the house shakes at night, walls crumble, why, even the floors move about.
   1073065|00000000||Is there anything to be done, a remedy for this?
    573040|00000000||Yes?
    594608|00000000||What do you want?
    594610|00000000||First they killed my son. Now they'll throw us out into the street.
    594612|00000000||Pucker up and kiss my arse!
   1073679|00000000||Halt! No passage. Bridge is closed.
   1073681|00000000||Because?
   1073819|00000000||Cause King Radovid said it should be. Won't let anyone through who don't have a pass.
   1073694|00000000||Perfect. Just so happens I have a pass.
   1073696|00000000||Whaa? Lemme see…
   1073857|00000000||Doesn't seem forged, but you never know… All right, move on.
   1073686|00000000||Got a pass.
   1073827|00000000||Just tell me who issues passes.
   1073840|00000000||Come on, give it a good think… I'm sure you know where I can get a pass.
   1073842|00000000||Errr…. Yeah… Royal officials issue 'em. But they're also available on the black market.
   1073845|00000000||From who?
   1073847|00000000||Don't know the names…. Ask folk around the crossin's. They'll know more.
   1073688|00000000||Farewell.
   1073828|00000000||Farewell.
   1073698|00000000||Farewell.
   1073838|00000000||Do just that.
   1073830|00000000||My kind has its ways. We just have to know where to look.
   1073832|00000000||Ah, well, that's different… It's royal officials who issue the official passes.
   1073834|00000000||Take it there're also unofficial ones, then?
   1073836|00000000||Mh, contraband, if you will, black market issue. You might ask folk near the crossings.
   1073826|00000000||I'm sure we can figure something out.
   1073690|00000000||Who issues these passes?
   1073692|00000000||Why you need to know? Your kind don't get passes, anyway. Not the right type, heheh.
   1073687|00000000||How do I get a pass?
   1073683|00000000||Oh, it's you… Can't let you pass without a… pass.
   1053638|00000000||Look at this, just look! Her cats've pissed all over my wash again!
   1053640|00000000||They're a scourge, that Julia and her furry friends.
   1053642|00000000||So break a bottle, mix the shards with some fish and set it out for them. They'll eat it and croak.
   1053644|00000000||Perhaps we could feed Julia the same?
   1053646|00000000||Good idea. We could finally see if there's any truth to the rumors… about the treasure.
    515159|ca8b0c01||Townswoman
   1054778|5be69a85||Temerian Guerilla
   1076847|00000000||Release me! The key is nearby, I'm sure!
    173717|00000000||A bracelet. One of them must've dropped it.
   1039716|00000000||En garde!
   1039718|00000000||Ugh… You're better than I thought…
   1045078|00000000||Run, run! If you value your life!
   1045080|00000000||Back again?!
   1045357|00000000||Not had enough?
   1045359|00000000||Stand and fight, you scoundrel!
    475818|00000000||You want the cap'n. Name's Wolverstone.
    415001|00000000||Bugger has to win!
    415003|00000000||Not goin' to happen.
    415005|00000000||Don't jinx it!
   1224625|00019dd6||Kal
    557837|00000000||Claw marks…
    557861|00000000||Caught one just before he reached the cave.
    557865|00000000||More will spawn. Need to destroy the nests.
    557866|00000000||Royal wyvern. Lucky me.
    558335|00000000||Wonder what happened.
   1034834|00000000||Wasn't them that attacked those people. Gotta be a royal wyvern hiding around here somewhere.
   1034837|00000000||Someone walked through the spilled wine.
   1034842|00000000||A flyer, swooped down… Judging by the claw marks, gotta be a wyvern or a forktail.
   1044942|00000000||Shattered the wine barrel, but seems the people managed to escape.
   1034843|00000000||Kaedweni. Smell'll linger for hours…
   1034946|00000000||Tracks lead to the cave.
    557818|00000000||Someone was running - fast, panicked. Prints're deep… end suddenly.
    473380|00000000||Dammit. Lots of smoke. Gotta hurry.
    485904|00000000||Lightning strike?
   1049334|00000000||Shit. Fire's spreading.
   1049336|00000000||Too late. No one's coming out.
   1065396|00000000||Dammit - won't budge. Probably bolted on the inside.
   1065572|00000000||Need another way in.
    409163|00000000||Dammit. Supposed to keep the fires lit.
   1088442|00000000||Humblest greetings.
   1088444|00000000||Greetings to you, sir.
   1088446|00000000||Pardon me.
   1088448|00000000||Aaaah!
    431556|00000000||This Baroness la Valette's villa?
    431558|00000000||Shouldn't interest you. The baroness don't mingle with just anyone.
    431560|00000000||Don't worry. I'm here to see her chambermaid, Molly.
    431562|00000000||Out of the way. Baroness is ridin' out. Begone.
    431567|00000000||Looking for a girl named Molly, heard she works here.
    431196|00000000||Geralt of Rivia at my doorstep? Surely, this is no chance encounter?
    431198|00000000||Greetings, Baroness. Greetings, General. You're right. I'm here for a reason.
    431200|00000000||There's no mistaking you. But, for etiquette's sake, Mary Louisa la Valette.
    433660|00000000||An imperial general and a witcher meet… and know each other. Surprising.
    433690|00000000||Yeah, we had an opportunity to, uh… talk when the emperor summoned me to Vizima.
    433692|00000000||Had you run afoul of var Emreis? No, you'd be long dead if that were so. It seems then that you share some interests…
    433697|00000000||But I shan't question you out of doors. Will you accept my invitation, tell me what brings you here?
    434370|00000000||Met Voorhis in Vizima.
    434368|00000000||We've met before.
    433666|00000000||We've met before…
    433668|00000000||And how! Imagine this, Louisa - the emperor desired a chat with the witcher. I, too, was fortunate enough to meet him then.
    433688|00000000||Hm... So Geralt of Rivia now works for Emperor Emhyr... Interesting... Has var Emreis sent you to rid Novigrad of monsters?
    433797|00000000||I fear your information's out of date. Molly no longer works here.
    433791|00000000||Seem to know who Molly is. You also know she doesn't work here anymore… Know where I can find her, maybe?
    433793|00000000||This time of day? Probably sipping punch and considering which horse to bet on.
    433795|00000000||Not in the mood for jokes.
    497913|00000000||I jest you not.
    433789|00000000||Where can I find her?
    433787|00000000||She get fired?
    433783|00000000||Baroness fired her?
    433785|00000000||Quite the contrary. Molly decided she no longer wished to serve.
    433777|00000000||After Aryan's demise, Louisa's nephew came to pay his respects. Got one glance of Molly, and - well, they wed soon after.
    433779|00000000||They now await his inheritance. With the baroness' son dead, the estate will go to the nephew… and Lady l'Attard, known until recently simply as Molly.
    433771|00000000||She marry for the gold?
    433767|00000000||Gotta wonder if Molly fell for the nephew or his inheritance.
    433769|00000000||We cannot know that just yet. But I'd wager she has strong feelings for both.
    433773|00000000||Where can I find Molly?
    433799|00000000||All right, so where'll I find the newly-minted Lady l'Attard?
    433801|00000000||Our dear little Molly has a new passion - horse racing. To my knowledge she should be at Countess Vegelbud's villa right now.
    433813|00000000||That's exactly where I'm going. Since you stripped me of Louisa's company, perhaps you'd agree to come along?
    502844|00000000||Think I can find my own way to the Vegelbud home.
    502845|00000000||Very well… Perhaps I can convince you to join me later at the races. I shall keep an eye out for you.
   1030866|00000000||Find my own way to the Vegelbuds'.
   1030867|00000000||Happy to go with you.
    431586|00000000||Well, if Molly'll be there…
    433815|00000000||On our way, then.
    502839|00000000||Happy to go with you.
    502838|00000000||Find my own way to the Vegelbuds'.
    431569|00000000||My maid-servant. I'm afraid she's currently at the home of my dear friend Patricia Vegelbud.
    433715|00000000||Perhaps Geralt could accompany us. He could speak with Molly at the races.
    433717|00000000||Is that something you'd consider, witcher? Care to partake of some sophisticated diversion?
    431216|00000000||Kill a woman's son, then appear at her doorstep? My, my, I thought witchers had better survival skills than that.
    440962|00000000||Greetings, witcher. Must admit it's curious to see you here. I don't quite believe in coincidences.
    431188|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Slayer of monsters… and my son.
    431190|00000000||You're right, General. My visit's no accident. I'm looking for someone.
    431192|00000000||There's no one here who wishes to see you. Captain, this man is not to enter. Forgive me, Morvran, but I've lost my appetite for the races.
    595828|aa66bb13||Nilfgaardian Messenger
   1004442|00000000||Eh, life were good afore the war. Groats in grease, curlded milk…
   1004443|00000000||And the old lord weren't near as bad as the baron…
   1004444|00000000||War'll end some day. Baron'll be driven out.
   1004445|00000000||Aye… Black Ones'll chase him off. And us along with 'im.
   1004446|00000000||Why? What do they want with our mires and thickets?
   1004447|00000000||Clear the thickets, dry up the mires… Settlers'll follow.
    448413|00000000||Fine, I'll handle the bandits. Go to your homes, bar the doors.
   1069062|00000000||Beware o' them, witcher. They're the dangerous type, truly.
    448411|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
    467544|00000000||Sorry. You'll have to manage on your own.
   1029636|00000000||Witcher, don't abandon us!
    467546|00000000||Let it rest, Egan. 'Twas clear from the start he'd not help. On your way, vagrant.
    449682|00000000||Sorry, gotta manage on your own.
   1029570|00000000||Why's this band want revenge, on you of all people?
   1029572|00000000||Cause… 'Cause I ratted on 'em to the witch hunters.
   1029574|00000000||Witch hunters care about bandits? Since when?
   1029576|00000000||Little Red's band, they was terrorizing our village. We had none to defend us. Finally Bertram went by the hunters, asked them.
   1029577|00000000||So the hunters went after 'em. We had a spell of peace, but now Little Red's learned of it all. Wants to kill Bertram. He's done for if you don't help.
    448379|00000000||Why do they want revenge?
    448375|00000000||Who's Little Red?
    465517|00000000||Who's Little Red?
   1029488|00000000||Word is she fornicates with wolves, and can tear a man apart with her bare mitts! A she-beast in a human husk, though some call her a great beauty.
    448370|00000000||She leads a pack of deserters, true dregs, from different armies. The kind what knows killin' and plunderin' well…
    448259|00000000||What's the problem?
    448261|00000000||Oh, nothin', on your way now, good man.
    448312|00000000||Shut it, Gottard. He could help.
   1029490|00000000||Little Red's band means to attack the village. Want revenge on Bertram. We haven't much, but we're willin' to pay if you defend us.
    571171|00000000||You'll do fine without it.
    571217|00000000||I think you'll tell me everything I need to know - bottle or no bottle.
   1016231|00000000||Yes, I will.
    571195|00000000||I was leaving the inn that night. Might've had a drink or… five, but I'm sure I wasn't hallucinating.
    571219|00000000||Something down an alley called me name. It were dark, I couldn't see what it was, but… it wasn't no human. Of that I'm certain.
   1040202|00000000||What makes you so sure?
   1016242|00000000||I just know. This thing grabbed the hem of my skirt, but I broke free and ran.
    571220|00000000||That it? You didn't see much.
    571222|00000000||Don't believe me either, do you? Fuck you. Fuck you all!
    571216|00000000||See, I'd rather you stayed… sober while we talked. Bought yourself that bottle later.
   1016228|00000000||Have it your way.
    571170|00000000||Take some coin.
    571146|00000000||See you.
    571147|00000000||Some other time.
   1039971|00000000||I'll be back.
    571149|00000000||Tell me about the monster, how you were attacked?
    571169|00000000||I'd need another bottle to get through it.
    571145|00000000||Let's talk about this attack, this beast.
    571148|00000000||Oh… Will you buy a round for a victim of the beast?
    571040|00000000||You done autopsies yet? Intend to?
    571041|00000000||Why would I? Beggars and vagrants - every last one stinking of cheap wine.
   1039964|00000000||Mind if I have a look?
   1039966|00000000||In point of fact, I'd prefer you didn't sniff around.
   1039968|00000000||Gonna make me come back with a written order?
   1039970|00000000||Good grief, pushy, aren't we? Here - the key to the morgue. Look all you want.
    571027|00000000||You examined them yet?
    571030|00000000||Know what? I'll come back.
    571028|00000000||Bye.
   1016206|00000000||You the medic? I'd like to see the monster's victims.
   1016208|00000000||Oh, yes. I've not had them burned yet, must get to that.
   1030638|00000000||Eternal Fire… Father of all… Hear my prayer…
   1030640|00000000||Grant my plea, bring my husband back to health.
   1030642|00000000||He's a good man. Honest… Righteous…
   1030646|00000000||Eternal Fire, you're my only hope… Grant what I ask, and I'll spare no offerin'…
   1032844|00000000||What brings you here?
   1032846|00000000||My neighbor, his name is Rudyard Necke. He works at Vivaldi's bank. He's wealthy.
   1032848|00000000||And this is what you wish to tell a servant of the Eternal Fire?
   1032850|00000000||He has guests, suspicious individuals. They meet weekly. Strange noises come from inside. Flashes…
   1032852|00000000||You've done well to tell me, my son. The Temple Guard must investigate. Novigrad must be cleansed of all magic practices.
   1054774|00000000||Welcome, welcome, do come in!
   1001027|00000000||Tournament participants only! Everyone else out! Achoo! We are cordially invited to come back tomorrow.
   1015649|00000000||Hm, slipped away without a word…
   1015651|00000000||But not before taking my best cards. Huh.
    447506|00000000||Good luck.
   1011209|00000000||You've got it comin'.
   1011207|00000000||Who's up for a thrashing?
   1011205|00000000||Eh?
   1011186|00000000||Shit!
   1011202|00000000||I'll tear your balls off!

   1004811|00000000||Quiet now, don't cry.
    486660|00000000||Dandelion… What the hell've you gotten yourself into…
    585772|00000000||Because we'll get angry if you don't.
    585782|00000000||My friend's very determined. Just saw him kill a man who refused to help us contact Karadin.
   1004722|00000000||You think you scare me? I don't give a fuck what happens to me.
    585885|00000000||Do whatever you think's right, Lambert. Not here to preach morals.
    585887|00000000||Haha! "Do what you think is right?" Only one thing worse than cold-blooded murder - hypocrisy.
    581279|00000000||Informers! Racists! Snitches!
    595852|00000000||Vienne? Bloody hell, what is it?!
    595854|00000000||They've come for me, Varen! I told you someone would, sooner or later…
    595856|00000000||{N'ess a tearth. }[Don't be afraid.]
    595858|00000000||Shit.
    581277|00000000||Do what you think's right.
    585913|00000000||No, Lambert.
   1036847|00000000||Right. Better to leave her like this.
   1036849|00000000||What about my coin?!
   1036852|00000000||Arseholes.
    581278|00000000||Don't kill her.
    585892|00000000||Satisfied?
   1036839|00000000||She doesn't know anything. We need to talk to Hammond and Selyse.
    585894|00000000||Don't go looking for Karadin. If he senses you nipping at his heels, he'll kill you without batting an eye.
    585896|00000000||We'll see. As for you…
    585802|00000000||Other members of the band - we need to contact them.
   1004724|00000000||This Selyse - where can we find her?
   1004726|00000000||She's done well for herself. Runs a brothel in Tretogor, the kind rich men frequent. Whores suck information out of them, then she sells it.
   1004791|00000000||Name of this brothel?
   1004793|00000000||The Black Lily. Selyse always did have horrible taste.
    585799|00000000||What do you know about Selyse?
    585903|00000000||What about you? What's your story?
    585905|00000000||Scoia'tael… unit was decimated, so I joined Karadin. They never treated me as an equal. No.
   1036838|00000000||I could hit a sparrow from a hundred paces… but I was never good enough for Karadin. He always preferred that cunt Selyse…
    585907|00000000||You have a hand in the murder of the witcher Aiden?
    585909|00000000||Perhaps. I don't remember.
    585801|00000000||Why did you join them?
    585800|00000000||Tell us about Hammond.
    585814|00000000||We need information about Hammond.
    585901|00000000||Karadin's right-hand man, once. When the band broke up, he went back to Faroe whence he had come.
   1036837|00000000||He's a pirate, now. Even the jarls treat him with respect.
   1036751|00000000||Who else was in Karadin's band?
   1005374|00000000||Aside from me? Selyse, Hammond, and Lund. But they've scattered all over the world. Selyse went to Tretogor, Hammond to Skellige, and Lund--
   1039114|00000000||Lund's dead.
    585796|00000000||Hahahahaha! Finally met his match. Well, you've only Hammond or Selyse to talk to, then.
    585790|00000000||Who were Karadin's mates?
   1036722|00000000||What do you mean, changed?
   1036725|00000000||Karadin's changed? What do you mean?
   1036756|00000000||He's dropped all his old connections, stopped taking on petty killings. He's hidden himself away in some hole. Must be planning something big.
   1036723|00000000||I was part of Karadin's band, but... when was that? I don't know where to find him, I've fallen out with the lot.
   1036724|00000000||Besides, he's no longer chummy with his old mates. Word around town is he's changed.
    585774|00000000||It's really important to my friend here.
    585776|00000000||And what will I get out of it?
    585778|00000000||Pay for your beer for starters. Then we'll see how valuable your information is.
    585771|00000000||Because we're asking you nicely.
    585764|00000000||Vienne?
    585766|00000000||What do you want?
    585768|00000000||We wanna see Jad Karadin.
   1004720|00000000||Hahahahahahah! Now why would I help you?
    518044|00000000||Harassin' us again? I'll teach you manners…
    518025|00000000||Enjoying yourselves?
    518026|00000000||Quite, in fact. But maybe you'd prefer we play with you?
    573168|00000000||Another time, maybe.
    518028|00000000||Never mind.
    518027|00000000||Gladly.
    518029|00000000||Gladly. Gotta warn you, though - you're not gonna have much fun.
    518045|00000000||Rally to me!
    594664|00000000||Not a step closer!
    594666|00000000||Maybe one o' them hired thugs? Who knows?
    594668|00000000||Novigrad proper, and still not safe at night.
    167646|fdda75c1||Rotfiend
   1025602|00000000||What can I get the lady? A nightdress? A cloak?
   1025604|00000000||Here for the doublet. Felt, it were. Put in the order with your sister.
   1025606|00000000||Ah, yes, I remember… I mean, so she told me. One moment, I'll bring it. Perhaps the lady would like to try on a bonnet while she waits?
    426156|00000000||This way, it's not far!
    466352|00000000||Now for a shot of Igni.
   1025504|00000000||Shit, one's still alive…
    466350|00000000||Yeah, sure stinks like a mass grave…
    468097|00000000||Now for the holy oils… Hope they burn well.
    477558|00000000||[PL] [DEBUG] Letho still alive?
    477560|00000000||[PL] No
   1014296|00000000||Is riding horses working properly?
   1014298|00000000||Horseriding is broken.
   1014297|00000000||Horseriding is fine.
    477559|00000000||[PL] Yes
    530721|00000000||One of 'em mentioned a protector… who'd be of no help. What is this about?
    530722|00000000||Let's say I've found a niche I intend to exploit.
    531575|00000000||The details I must keep to myself. After all, I did not agree to pay you to ask me questions.
    530723|00000000||Haven't seen a single crown yet.
    530724|00000000||Because we've not yet finished our stroll.
    530718|00000000||Those men were waiting for you, lying in ambush. What are you involved in?
    530719|00000000||Those men were common cretins, unaware they'd cast their net for an extremely big fish.
    530720|00000000||I'll remember that when it comes time for you to pay up.
    500707|00000000||Where're those crafting supplies?
    539128|00000000||That'd be it. Gotta signal them now.
    542389|00000000||Does stink of ammonia.
    542390|00000000||Must be it.
   1003007|00000000||Not this one. No stench.
   1038360|00000000||Guess I should interject.
    503780|00000000||What a thwack! That musta hurt!
    503847|00000000||One more punch! One more punch!
    503862|00000000||Booo!
    516365|00000000||Dropped his guard like a chump!
    503863|00000000||Pile-driver! Pile-driver!
   1074506|00000000||Packs quite a punch… gotta grant him that.
   1074508|00000000||I'm awed. I'm awed you're still standin', frankly.
    525408|00000000||I did it.
    525409|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, you've defeated the Champion of Champions in fair combat, earned the right to bear the title yourself. This very eve I'll send word to the four corners of the world.
    525411|00000000||The title is yours, as is the champion's prize.
    558635|00000000||Ye we summon, ye we call. Enter, souls, we'll judge ye all.
    558636|00000000||All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
    561894|00000000||Something whispers, something peeps. Someone near our fire creeps.
    561896|00000000||All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
    498766|00000000||No. I never am.
    498771|00000000||I never lose my way.
    498778|00000000||Mmm. If that's true, what are you doin' so deep in the forest alone?
    498779|00000000||Looking for lost little girls.
    498799|00000000||Where do you live?
    486150|00000000||Why don't you tell me where you live.
    486151|00000000||In Lindenvale. They'd see to your wounds there.
    486148|00000000||Why follow the trail of treats?
    486176|00000000||Your father - why did he have you follow the trail of treats? Do you know?
    486185|00000000||Because… we had naught to break our fast with.
    496244|00000000||I don't understand.
    496246|00000000||I was naughty… broke a jug… spilled all our milk.
    486197|00000000||Your parents must've been angry.
    486194|00000000||Mother said I should be spanked, but father said 'twouldn't do no good - too many mouths to feed anyway.
    486190|00000000||Sending me down the trail of treats - that would solve things.
    486139|00000000||Remember how to get home?
    498830|00000000||You and your father - when did you leave home?
    498864|00000000||This mornin'.
    498866|00000000||And did the sun warm your face or your back?
    498868|00000000||It warmed my back.
    498869|00000000||So we must go east.
    495535|00000000||Come, I'll help you up.
    495536|00000000||Hrgh.
    486265|00000000||See what I've got on my back?
    486267|00000000||Wolves fear it. Kings do too.
    486222|00000000||Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.
    486223|00000000||The Wolf King?
    486251|00000000||No kings among wolves.
    486255|00000000||These have one!
    486272|00000000||And you've seen him?
    486274|00000000||Yes! I mean, no. From behind a tree. He was huge, with giant eyes and great fangs, and he was terribly, disgustably horrific!
    498825|00000000||Come. I'll walk you home.
    498827|00000000||And explain to your parents that they must not lose their children in the woods.
    498828|00000000||We can't go home. 'Cause of the Wolf King and his pack…
    498823|00000000||Hmm… not a bad idea.
    498819|00000000||Good idea. I shall walk you home.
    498820|00000000||How'd you get here?
    498800|00000000||How did you wind up here?
    498804|00000000||My father brought me. Told me to follow the trail of treats and eat my fill. He said he would wait.
    498807|00000000||So I started down the trail, but then I saw a butterfly, and I ran to catch it, and I lost my way.
    498798|00000000||How is it you're here?
    486227|00000000||What happened to you?
    486243|00000000||This? Hm, it's… nothing.
    498769|00000000||Yes. Though also just a little.
    498782|00000000||Does that mean… you know which way to go?
    498793|00000000||Not quite, not yet. But I'm sure we'll find the way if we set off together.
    498765|00000000||Yes, I'm lost, too.
    498762|00000000||Hello there. Are you lost?
    498764|00000000||A little, I guess. Are you?
    495511|00000000||You can come down!
   1054297|00000000||You're on everyone's tongues, you know! Coin and fame aplenty now, eh?
   1052320|00000000||What can I get you, good sir? I've everything from apples to zander.
   1052322|00000000||Paper, please. And a bottle of ink.
   1052324|00000000||Ooh, I'm out of paper… Requisitioned by the army. To support the war effort.
   1052336|00000000||Paper? For the war effort?
   1052338|00000000||You know… All those announcements, ordinances and decrees must appear on something.
   1030560|00000000||Tomorrow I intend to close my account at Vivaldi's bank.
   1030562|00000000||Wise. That usurer pays lower and lower returns.
   1030564|00000000||Falling returns are not my concern. Soaring inflation is.
   1030566|00000000||Yes. You'd have done better to keep your coin in real estate. An empty lot fetches more today than an entire villa did a year past.
    417818|00000000||How are we to fight a pestilence that changes form?!
    418527|00000000||None can be certain of his father, brother or bride!
    418529|00000000||Look upon your neighbor, for he too could be a doppler!
    418531|00000000||Will we submit to uncertainty?! Will we allow monsters and charlatans to overrun our city?!
    417820|00000000||No!
    418533|00000000||May the Holy Flame of the Eternal Fire complete this act of cleansing!
    417814|00000000||Our Novigrad - shining and brilliant! Pearl amongst cities! Cradle of the Eternal Fire!
    418519|00000000||Yet it is here that darkness raises its hideous head!
    426971|00000000||A deceitful doppler doubling as commander of the Guard!
    418521|00000000||A band of charlatans, diviners and witches poised to pinch your purity and prosperity!
    418523|00000000||The time has come for this to end! For us to cast off evil! Do you renounce evil?!
    417816|00000000||We renounce evil!
    426973|00000000||Do you renounce evil?!
    426975|00000000||We renounce it!
    418525|00000000||May the Holy Flame of the Eternal Fire complete this cleansing, this purging of pestilence into purity!
   1032498|00000000||And this? The aroma is positively fascinating…
   1032501|00000000||Mmm… Koviri jasmine, a hint of wood, rose petals from Nazair, civet…
   1032508|00000000||Civet? What's that?
   1032522|00000000||An excretion from the hind end of a type of spotted weasel. Very expensive.
   1032509|00000000||What? Disgusting!
   1032511|00000000||My dear, there should be something disgusting in every fine scent.
   1074855|00000000||For what you did, I must thank you again.
   1074863|00000000||I promised you a reward. Do you remember? It remains in the barn, in the chest.
   1075604|00000000||I must find this spot… I must bid Humbert farewell.
    551761|00000000||Got some hard news too, though. Found your brother's corpse, bricked up in a wall. And this.
    551762|00000000||So… Roderick… my husband, he killed him. Gods!
   1011157|00000000||Sorry.
   1011159|00000000||The truth can be cruel… But, ah... one can't turn back time.
   1074889|00000000||Found a body in the cellar.
   1074875|00000000||Hope this proves a peaceful home. Farewell.
   1075617|00000000||Farewell, witcher. And do take care of yourself.
   1074894|00000000||Farewell.
   1075609|00000000||Your return home - how was it?
   1075611|00000000||Managing all right? Hope there wasn't too much monster damage.
   1075613|00000000||A bit… Though time, I think, was the greater culprit.
   1075615|00000000||But I don't let it worry me. I spent my youth in this house. Restoring its splendor will be a pleasure, not a burden.
   1074859|00000000||Greetings.
   1074861|00000000||Ah, such a kind guest! So glad to see you, witcher, welcome.
   1075584|00000000||Humbert, poor Humbert... Roderick, how could you…?
   1051324|00000000||{Aen Ard Feain! Ess'ann tu kan... } [Great Sun! I almost fainted...]
   1051326|00000000||{Ess'zien mìloinn camraid... Esse versla'va aep kamndant? } [You don't look well, friend… Maybe you should report to the commander?]
   1051328|00000000||{Neen, neen, esse'fairich feer. Tom aep anear voer. } [No, no, it's passed. An aftershock from today's rations, I wager.]
    594602|00000000||Do you want to get slapped?
    594604|00000000||Naught but thieves, whores and murderers.
    594606|00000000||Why the googly eyes? Got a case of the bloat?
    583142|00000000||Before you ask - it wasn't me.
   1015202|00000000||Figured as much.
   1015207|00000000||You promised to help me. I say we try to recover the coin together.
   1015209|00000000||My offer still stands. Perhaps you'd search for the coin with me?
   1010254|00000000||I say, this witcher is Captain Hansen's good friend. He could examine the crime scene, charge only a trifling.
   1015214|00000000||A fee? But--
   1015216|00000000||We will, of course, collect it from the captain personally. How is his injury from the other week? Has it healed yet?
   1015220|00000000||Well… I'd heard it had.
   1015222|00000000||Splendid. We shall go upstairs at once.
   1001151|00000000||Agreed. Where do we start?
   1001152|00000000||We must get upstairs. Wait.
   1001149|00000000||Agreed.
   1001154|00000000||Rather not get involved in this, thanks.
   1001155|00000000||I see Fringilla exaggerated immensely. You're not dependable in the least. Goodbye.
   1001150|00000000||Rather not get involved, thanks.
   1015204|00000000||An unexpected turn of events, but… Our agreement stands. We must try to recover the coin together.
    594646|00000000||You again?
    594648|00000000||Why you lookin' at me cross-eyed, grayboy?

   1042957|00000000||Heard little Hannie prances in there! And she's got ample prancin' material…
   1042959|00000000||You're vulgar! You're swine!
   1042961|00000000||What you mean, vulgar? I'm appreciatin' art!
   1042949|00000000||A cabaret?! Well I'll be…
   1042951|00000000||Music, dancin' and birds barin' their arses - now that I understand!
   1042953|00000000||Though I hope they won't admit such riff-raff…
   1042955|00000000||Don't fret, darling, I'm certain they won't.

    426712|00000000||A beast, a beast. If they fail to release one tonight, I'll charge the proprietor with heresy.
    422639|00000000||Heheh.
    422641|00000000||Do they have anything extraordinary?
    426714|00000000||They had better, for their sake.
   1010997|00000000||Achoo!
   1010995|00000000||Uh, hello.
   1010993|00000000||He's got it coming.
   1010989|00000000||Smash his face!
   1010991|00000000||Want your face smashed?
    573099|00000000||What happened here?
    573100|00000000||M'lord wanted to see to everythin', inspect the property personally. So he went down, all the way down, to the cellars.
    593998|00000000||…and crrrrash! The ceilin' collapsed on 'im. End of story.
    594021|00000000||Unfortunate. Very.
    573098|00000000||Squashed to a pulp, he was. Quite a lot of property that one had. Wonder who it'll go to now?
    345459|00000000||Shouldn't go any further without taking that antidote.
    170734|00017dcc||Boy
   1018950|00000000||What if the witcher angers the beast?
   1018951|00000000||Quiet… Anythin' happens - leg it.
   1035078|00000000||We're saved! Thank ye.
   1035077|00000000||Maybe we should look around, see if there's anythin'…
   1044886|00000000||Might be a coin purse if the wyvern dragged some rich man here…
    586787|00000000||Good thing we got here before they found the others.
    586793|00000000||Good thing we got here before they found the hatch, grabbed the others.
    586795|00000000||This is not about numbers, Geralt…
    586797|00000000||This is no time to mourn. Come with me.
    586789|00000000||Knew exactly what he was signing up for.
    586791|00000000||Small comfort…
    586786|00000000||Knew what he signed up for.
    586781|00000000||Dammit… We took too long.
    586783|00000000||Too long? We set out to rescue two people.
    586785|00000000||Yes. And lost one.
    416373|00000000||A kid.
   1054284|00000000||Wait… was it you who helped us?
    416184|00000000||Found you. You're the last one.
    416186|00000000||Bet you cheated.
    417331|00000000||Come to the cottage, I gotta tell the others I won.

   1016534|00000000||Holofernus Meiersdorf, at your service. Meet my sons, Bernie, Franklin and Hugo.
   1036912|00000000||Worried about the "apiarian phantom"? Saw your notice.
   1036914|00000000||That's right. He's ravaging my hives.
   1036910|00000000||Something's destroyed our fields and hives. We think it's… the apiarian phantom.
   1016543|00000000||Nice to meet you. Geralt of Rivia.
   1016548|00000000||I know who you are. Recognized the hair. Truth is, I've been waiting for someone like you.
   1009802|00000000||Hm… Any relation to Rico Meiersdorf?
   1009803|00000000||Ugh, ehh, yes. My youngest son. Sadly, he fled the family business. Went to seek fortune in the big city.
   1016538|00000000||Why do you ask? Do you know him?
   1009804|00000000||Ahem, well, yeah, we've met… But that's not why I'm here. Came about the notice you posted.
   1039336|00000000||It's the apiarian phantom. It's ravaging my hives.
   1016541|00000000||But that's a long story, and I'm in need of help. From one like you.
   1016545|00000000||Namely?
   1036908|00000000||Well, you're a witcher, right? I'm looking for someone who can drive off or kill an apiarian phantom. One is ravaging my hives.
   1074455|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1074461|00000000||As far as my reward's concerned…
   1074462|00000000||Ooooh, no, that is not an amount we can spare.
   1074464|00000000||Hm… Honeyfill's not been generating the revenues of old since the phantom appeared… Would you be willing to reduce your price?
   1074484|00000000||Enough! We might have been well off once, but our funds are far from abundant now. You must take what we can give and drive the phantom away. Or I shall find someone else to do the job.
   1074466|00000000||Ahh, as you wish. Fail to rid us of the phantom, and we'll go belly up anyway. I shall look upon your fee as an investment.
   1074468|00000000||So it's a deal?
   1074470|00000000||It is, it is.
   1039512|00000000||Farmhand who died - what'd you do with the body? Wouldn't mind a look.
   1039514|00000000||Too late for that. We buried the poor fellow a few days back.
   1038220|00000000||Saw the frozen hive. Found some tracks leading to the neighboring lot. Unfinished building there… tried to get inside, but the door was locked.
   1038222|00000000||We started building that home for Bernie, but ran out of coin and had to stop. Do you think the phantom's hiding in there?
   1038224|00000000||Don't know, but I should check. Can I get the key?
   1038226|00000000||Here.
   1038228|00000000||Stay inside until I return.
   1039516|00000000||Been to the site of the attack.
   1039518|00000000||Sorry. Can't take this job.
   1039517|00000000||Farmhand's body - where is it?
   1039497|00000000||Farmhand's body - where is it?
   1038212|00000000||Where'd the phantom appear - can any of you show me?
   1038214|00000000||I'll go. Come with me.
   1039496|00000000||Where'd this phantom appear?
   1039498|00000000||Sorry. Can't take the job.
   1016567|00000000||Ahem, of course, I understand. Well, if you change your mind, that is, once you've had your soup and feel like tending to the apiary phantom, I'll be here, waiting.
   1039394|00000000||Soup again? You witchers do eat a great deal… Well, so be it, if you change your mind and want to face the phantom, you know where to find us.
   1016565|00000000||Just remembered - I left a cauldron of soup on the fire…
   1039356|00000000||Gotta go, see you.
   1039344|00000000||Can you describe this "phantom"?
   1036928|00000000||You do realize this "apiarian phantom" - well, there is no such thing. It's a monster. Gotta be. A wraith, maybe. Any of your workers see anything?
   1036932|00000000||I did. I was cleaning a hive when I heard a farmhand cry out. Screamed as though he'd been stung by a whole swarm all at once. I ran to him, but he was dead.
   1039403|00000000||Any stings on him?
   1039405|00000000||None. He looked like he had… frostbite. Blue lips, frost in his hair. And dead bees lay all around him.
   1039362|00000000||Oh, you're back. Have you changed your mind? Will you vanquish the apiarian phantom?
   1039601|00000000||Told you already - no such thing.
   1037036|00000000||This way, follow me.
   1037038|00000000||Where'd you get the idea it was an "apiarian phantom"?
   1037041|00000000||It's a beekeeping superstition. You mismanage the bees' offerings, the phantom appears.
   1047288|00000000||He destroys the hives and kills the bees so that no one can use these noble creatures for ignoble purpose.
   1039627|00000000||Sicced your bees on the competition, eh?
   1039629|00000000||No. Father recently signed a contract with the Redanians.
   1039631|00000000||So the phantom's from Nilfgaard…
   1009980|00000000||You're our one hope. Drive off the beast - I'll reward you generously.
   1010092|00000000||Welcome to Honeyfill, traveler.
   1037079|00000000||This is the place. Here's where the phantom killed the farmhand.
   1037081|00000000||Maybe it left some tracks.
   1016885|00000000||I'll win today, I know it.
   1016887|00000000||Ehh, same outcome as ever. Stuff this, I really enjoyed the workbench more.
   1051505|00000000||At least I'm good at leatherworking.
    316717|05a3f51c||Child
   1018519|00000000||I wonder what all this means. They look hastily scribbled on with lime.
   1059375|00000000||Hunting dog. Can't see any connection to Kelpie.
   1034928|00000000||Must you touch everything?!
   1034976|00000000||Geralt!
   1060740|00000000||Geralt, are you all right?
   1060742|00000000||You might say so.
   1061006|00000000||Oof… Anything like that ever happen to you before?
   1061008|00000000||Weeell, almost. While back a certain doppler took a shot at impersonating me.
   1061010|00000000||Yes? And?
   1061917|00000000||He hated being me. Felt uncomfortable. Dopplers're kind-hearted by nature.
   1059470|00000000||A sea monster. Looks a bit like a kayran.
   1059583|00000000||Let's see what this does…
   1035183|00000000||Geralt? I don't know what you did, but it worked! Come back here!
   1035248|00000000||Let's go.
   1040143|00000000||Look, they're opening!
   1034998|00000000||Kelpie…
   1059473|00000000||Geralt, what the hell is that?!
   1061907|00000000||Another security measure. Dammit all…
   1059486|00000000||Do you think it's a mind game of some sort?
   1061909|00000000||You know, can you defeat yourself? Are you willing to?
   1059488|00000000||Perhaps these apparitions believe they are real.
   1061911|00000000||Sorry, I just don't share your doubts. Know exactly which one of you's real.
   1061914|00000000||Now focus on the fight.
   1034949|00000000||Look. It's rather similar to that other pillar with the projection…
   1035246|00000000||Another swallow.
   1034974|00000000||Drawing of a horse. Clue for Ciri, must be.
   1071495|00000000||Another horse. Almost exactly like the last one.
   1059576|00000000||Water's vibrating. As if boulders were moving beneath the surface.
   1014827|00000000||Maybe not you.
   1014831|00000000||Maybe not you, but she'd kill someone eventually, that's certain.
   1014833|00000000||Succubi feed on human energy. Lose that and it means death, eventually.
   1014835|00000000||Life leads to death, eventually! You're murderers! Go to hell!
   1014841|00000000||Incredible. We risked our lives to find him - now we're the monsters?
   1014843|00000000||Happens a lot more often than you think… Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta find that damn flower. Any idea where there might be pimpernel?
   1014845|00000000||You saw the forest - not a daisy or a kingcup in sight. I'd say it's her doing. She took them, gathered them… somewhere nearby.
   1018396|00000000||Farewell, witcher. Thank you for your help. And good luck!
   1014829|00000000||Really believe that?
   1014826|00000000||Really believe that?
    556459|00000000||What… What have you done?!
   1014823|00000000||We saved you, Ramund.
   1014825|00000000||The hell you did! She'd never hurt me! Never!
   1050783|00000000||Done.
   1050781|00000000||[Step away.]
   1050780|00000000||[Add mash.]
   1050779|00000000||Here's where the mash goes, probably.
   1064797|00000000||Hang on, Geralt! On our way!
    384557|00000000||Pest take me, it's writhing something fierce! I can't hold it! Calm it somehow!
    384559|00000000||Squirmin' again! Like a daft eel! I cannot hold it!
    384562|00000000||Ooph, ooph… Quiet now.
    384564|00000000||It worked. It's stopped.
   1071475|00000000||Damn thing's gonna bite me! Calm it down!
   1071472|00000000||Don't just stand there! Ploughing do something!
   1071467|00000000||Bloody hell, not now, Geralt! Let's do what we must.
   1071469|00000000||Come, now - we must bury it. We'll speak afterwards.
    407616|00000000||No way am I going to fight you.
    407620|00000000||You're right - guess you had no choice in that case. But I'm still not gonna fight you.
    422665|00000000||You must! Or I shall cut you down, honorably, though without mercy!
    407618|00000000||You never asked. But, since you've all gone to the trouble… Let's fight.
    407614|00000000||Fine. I'll fight you all.
   1053662|00000000||You'd better go home. Get some sleep. Think things over tomorrow.
   1053664|00000000||Wise words.
   1053666|00000000||Don't know about you two, but I'm feelin' a bit sleepy.
   1053668|00000000||We're done here…
   1053660|00000000||Go home.
    407566|00000000||Prepare for battle! You shall not have it easy this time.
    407568|00000000||Brought friends? Hm. They all pledge to defend Maid Bilberry's honor, too?
    419854|00000000||Noo… No, no, they defend justice - for it is only fair you face a threesome.
    422610|00000000||Is that so?
    422612|00000000||Yes! For you are a rogue and a cheat, sir! You never revealed yourself to be a witcher!
   1024980|00000000||We still talking about a priest of the Eternal Fire?
   1025027|00000000||I'd say so! Beet-stained pricks can't be trusted! This one'd ordered premium grade fisstech from me three times, everythin' perfect…
   1025092|00000000||But the fourth his men came at us with knives. Sought to knock us outta the trade.
   1025489|00000000||Shoved me in that ditch with the corpses, must've thought the ghouls would take care o' the rest.
   1025048|00000000||And to make sure, he hired a witcher to burn the bodies, destroy any evidence.
   1025132|00000000||A witcher?! Meanin' you?! So what now?
   1025143|00000000||Nothing. Didn't pay me to burn the living.
   1025179|00000000||Ah, thank the gods it's true what they say: though mutants, you live by a code! Oh, thank you, witcher!
   1024977|00000000||We still talking about a priest of the Eternal Fire?
   1024982|00000000||Bullshit.
   1024984|00000000||Right. Got things backwards on account o' the drama. Thanks for helpin' me.
   1024985|00000000||Fuck, saw a ghoul take a corpse's leg! Whole damn leg, in one swipe!
   1025014|00000000||Gotta go somewhere else. Even if it's ploughin' Poviss.
   1024978|00000000||Nonsense.
    403999|00000000||If it ain't that fuckin' priest, it's corpse eaters… I'm done with this damned town.
   1024926|00000000||A priest?
   1024928|00000000||We'd agreed to meet as usual, just a larger delivery… "Good customer," I thought… Then they whipped out blades!
    169895|00000000||Wait… Something just happened.
    169897|00000000||Mhm. Behind that wall, a movement.
    472747|00000000||Greetings. Have you come to race or are you merely a spectator?
   1051561|00000000||Haven't decided yet.
   1051563|00000000||Speak to the race master if you decide to compete. He's over there - on the platform.
    471599|00000000||You seem quite the rider, though not as good as Luc.
   1051559|00000000||A shame, really. I'd like to see someone knock the conceited brat down a peg.
    472750|00000000||I saw you ride. Did rather well in that race.
    471161|00000000||Greetings.
    471601|00000000||You did wonderfully!
    166754|68667754||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    365144|00000000||Welcome! What can I get the honorable gentleman? New poulaines, perchance? I've not got a true pair, but they'll be the same size!
   1028791|00000000||We get some cards in, too, I'll be a happy man.
   1028757|00000000||Dunno that I'm gonna buy anything, but I sure wouldn't mind a few rounds of gwent.
   1086510|00000000||What would say to some gwent?
    366050|00000000||Thanks.
    416680|00000000||Come again! Cheap as it gets, right here!
    365545|00000000||So long.
    365543|00000000||Show me what you got.
    366038|00000000||Fine. Show me what you got.
    366040|00000000||Sir, what don't I got! Somethin' for everyone, seek and ye shall find! Cheap, too!
    366036|00000000||Ah, I see the honorable gentleman is not one to let a bargain pass!
    182897|00000000||We have for you a tale moving and heartbreaking…

   1011057|00000000||Uh-oh... Trouble.
   1011053|00000000||Bloody hell.
   1011055|00000000||Wise guy, eh?
    499651|00000000||Hrr akh akh akh…! Shite! N-not again! Not again!
    499652|00000000||Blhrrrraaagh bleugh hrrleugh…
    499647|00000000||Hrrr a bite… Just one morrrrrsel… hrrrr…
    499648|00000000||Hrrr one piece… hrrrr a crrrrrrumb… hrrrr food, food… hrrrr…
   1073807|00000000||Notalky! Shoeses make!
   1073809|00000000||Ogg angergets and you diemake!
   1064202|00000000||When someone pisses you off, you needn't ploughin' kill him. It's not your only arsebitin' recourse.
   1066595|00000000||When but Ogg hitmake, humanses alltime die.
   1066597|00000000||So don't bloody hitmake. Yell at 'em, that's good enough.
   1066599|00000000||Heeeeeh?
   1066601|00000000||You walk up to the bloke, bare your teeth, furl your brow and say, "Fuck off, you miserable cunt." Understand?
   1067774|00000000||All right. Let's, uh, move to some exercises.
   1067776|00000000||Repeat after me: "You thrice fucked whore - ploughed, buggered and blowin'." Take turns. Ogg?
   1065423|00000000||Errr… You… Yooooo…
   1067778|00000000||Argh, all right. Pogg? Maybe you could give it a shot?
   1067780|00000000||Errr…
   1066604|00000000||Agh, guess we should start with something simpler.
   1066612|00000000||Err, gimme a minute.
   1066606|00000000||Right, got it. We'll start easy.
   1066754|00000000||"Fu-cking cunt." Repeat that.
   1066608|00000000||Fu… Fu… Fuggy?
   1066610|00000000||Shite, no! "Fucking cunt!" Bugger me, you're a moron…
   1065425|00000000||Ogg no morony! Ogg Tala finder! Ogg finderinger!
   1066752|00000000||And you cobbleringer, shoesesmake! Notalky!
    594635|00000000||Bored or somethin'?
    594637|00000000||Your mug, it just ain't like any I've ever seen.
    594639|00000000||Beh, mustn't think like that.
    462798|00000000||Dog's tame - a pet. Wonder what it's doing here.
    462800|00000000||Hm, got a key sewed to your collar.
   1044058|00000000||"Portrait of Emperor Emhyr, tempera on wood." Pretty flattering, I'd say.
    421963|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    421957|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421965|00000000||Willing to craft something for me?
    421959|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
    421967|00000000||So long.
    421961|00000000||Farewell.
   1035010|00000000||Mastercrafted armor - think you can make it?
   1035011|00000000||Mastercrafted armor - think you could make me some?
   1035037|00000000||Ooo, I did get my journeyman's papers, but I've yet to make anything akin to a masterwork…
   1035039|00000000||You might try in Velen. A dwarf there, goes by Fergus, he might help.
   1035041|00000000||Guildsmen claim there's no one better anywhere south of the Pontar.
    422112|00000000||Welcome, welcome!
    421955|00000000||Top notch swords!
    358190|e29b1c4b||Sorceress
    498724|00000000||Everything seems to suggest a fiend…
    498738|00000000||You're smart! How do you know these things? Did your father teach you?
    498740|00000000||Not my father. My uncle. Uncle Vesemir.
    498745|00000000||Of dog tallow, fool's parsley, wolf's liver and mistletoe. The fiend will feel terrible, terrible pain…
    498742|00000000||Of dog tallow, wolfsbane, fool's parsley and wolf's liver. The Wolf King will feel terrible, terrible pain…
    495732|00000000||What happened to him?
    495733|00000000||He… had a fall.
    496398|00000000||Mhm, I bet. The Wolf King got him.
    496416|00000000||Hm, when did children get so smart?
    495736|00000000||What'll we do when the Wolf King finds us?
    496420|00000000||Good question. I've no silver, but I can make a blade oil.
    496421|00000000||Oil? You mean like we make from rapeseed?
    496423|00000000||No, a far more special oil.
    495730|00000000||The Wolf King's no fantasy, it seems. Except, he's a werewolf.
    495695|00000000||Summing up…
    495682|00000000||Lips parted and bloated… Bit clear through his tongue.
    496323|00000000||Immense pain before death.
    495697|00000000||Head.
    495701|00000000||Ah, his chest is crushed. Ribs probably pierced his lungs.
    496353|00000000||Something picked him up and threw him against the tree.
    495698|00000000||Chest.
    498728|00000000||Hmm… Something tore his leg off. No, gnawed it off.
    498899|00000000||Eeew, that's horrible!
    498901|00000000||Stay there, and look away.
    498903|00000000||Hmm… What's this? Marrow's missing. Interesting.
    495699|00000000||Leg.
    498727|00000000||Let's see… Oh, his liver's gone.
    498906|00000000||Why're you diggin' through his belly?
    498909|00000000||Would you mind making certain your laces are tied?
    495700|00000000||Belly.
    495696|00000000||Eyes.
    495680|00000000||Hmm… Bloodshot, but still moist. He died recently.
    495677|00000000||Wait here. Don't come any closer.
    496310|00000000||But…
    496312|00000000||No buts. Stay here. I must see something.
    495552|00000000||Look! There's something there.
    512533|00000000||Wonder if Dijkstra knows Junior's made a deal with the Redanians?
    417888|00000000||Goin' to the execution? They're to burn a beast turned human in form.
    417890|00000000||Not just a beast! A witch is to roast as well.
    418537|00000000||Takin' your boy to see it?
    418539|00000000||Can't decide… nipper's got but five winters on him…
    418541|00000000||I'm takin' me girl.
    418543|00000000||She ought to see, ought to know what awaits her if she strays.
   1062519|c7782b0b||Deserter Leader
    434476|00000000||Well, not like it can be useful to a dead man.
    467662|00000000||Truly reasoned! May it serve you, instead!
    434338|00000000||Gladly.
    434478|00000000||A dead man's sword? No thanks.
    434480|00000000||Dead or quick - who cares 'bout some previous owner? Sword cuts the same, regardless. But if it's not to your likin', fine.
    434340|00000000||No, I don't want to.
    434342|00000000||What happened here?
    434344|00000000||Ye stupid or blind? It's clear as day!
    467654|00000000||Tis also clear he's a witcher. Spare 'im your lip and answer!
    467656|00000000||I knows as much as yous - meanin' nothin'. But with a little learnin', corpses can be read like books. Black 'uns, see? Fought the Reds, for the bridge.
    467660|00000000||We's merely seein' to it that, uh… nothin' goes to waste. Take this fine sword, for example - found it in the rushes… Maybe you'd like to buy it?
    513276|00000000||Ship was funded with donations. From noblewomen.
    513277|00000000||Ladies from the most prominent families gave up their jewelry.
    515850|00000000||A spur-of-the-moment, patriotic impulse?
    513278|00000000||You're a homeless wanderer. Can't understand what it is to truly love one's country.
    472950|00000000||What're doin', you fool? You'll not get 'er away in time.
    472952|00000000||I'll not give 'er up! Not on me life!
    472954|00000000||They hear her squealin', they'll kill us and take her all the same!
    472956|00000000||So I'll slaughter 'er meself, hide 'er corpse 'neath the floorboards. Those bastards won't have 'er!
    472958|00000000||All right, all right. We'll cover the blood with sand.
    473908|00000000||Begone! This has naught to do with you.
    473910|00000000||Leave this place, sir.
    424995|00000000||Beat you half to death… Hey, can you hear me?
    425037|00000000||Shit, those cocksuckers got me good…
    427517|00000000||Bones are intact.
    456850|00000000||Will you free me?
    548454|00000000||Who are you?
    548456|00000000||What's your name?
    548458|00000000||Rico. Rico Meiersdorf.
    512077|00000000||Change your mind?
    512070|00000000||Take care of yourself.
    512071|00000000||Thanks. I'll lay low until things settle down.
    548549|00000000||Bedlam'll learn you helped me. See him - he's sure to reward you.
    512068|00000000||Run.
    512074|00000000||Don't trust you an inch.
    514901|00000000||Told you all I know, I swear!
    514903|00000000||You'll have to stay a bit longer.
    512075|00000000||No, please… Think about it. It's not too late, hear me?!
    512069|00000000||Stay a while.
    548459|00000000||Why are you here?
    548460|00000000||Eh, what's it look like? Came here to sit and think.
    548461|00000000||All right, clever and tough's not working for me. They took me for one of Bedlam's moles.
    548462|00000000||Are you?
    548463|00000000||Well… kinda. Yeah.
    548556|00000000||So, what have you… kinda… learned?
    548558|00000000||Whoreson's working hand in glove with the Redanians. I don't know the details, but he's on their side. And that's all I know.
    425039|00000000||You're not hurt all that bad. Let's talk first.
    548453|00000000||Let's chat first.
    425035|00000000||Who the hell are you? Heard screaming downstairs…
    427513|00000000||It's all right now.
    456848|00000000||Will you help me?
    425002|00000000||You alive?
    425031|00000000||Don't… finish me…
    425033|00000000||Don't intend to.
    418402|00000000||I don't. And I don't much care.
    418404|00000000||Never said I knew where you were going. Just think we're going in the same direction.
    418648|00000000||Then you'd best change yours.
    344761|00000000||I don't want anything from you.
    417865|00000000||Pucker up and kiss my arse.
    417867|00000000||C'mon. We can figure something out.
    344771|00000000||Argh, sod off, poofter.
    344755|00000000||I'm sure we can figure something out.
    344779|00000000||Like you'll be when I let a few people know you pocket some? Not all the nonhuman gold makes it to the King, does it?
    344781|00000000||What the fuck're you on about? I don't pocket a thing.
    417869|00000000||I'm not the one you need to explain this to.
    417884|00000000||All this shite goes to the King. Along with whatever I make.
    430737|00000000||Uh-huh.
    430739|00000000||Actually think Bedlam'll believe you? You're in for a fuckin' surprise. Come on, genius. Can't wait to see what he does to you.
    344757|00000000||I think you're stealing from the King of Beggars.
    358394|00000000||Well, you're not as clever as you think. And I'm not blind. You're on your way to see the King of Beggars.
    358396|00000000||Gonna rob me? Got any ploughing idea what a courier is?
    430741|00000000||This gold is from the nonhumans. Take it and you'll be fucked.
    418400|00000000||Just do. You're off to see the King of Beggars.
    430731|00000000||Misunderstanding. Sorry.
    430733|00000000||I should bloody well say so.
    430729|00000000||This is a misunderstanding.
    422879|00000000||Why the hell're you followin' me?
    422881|00000000||Just happen to be going where you're going.
    422883|00000000||And how the bloody hell d'you know where I'm goin'?
   1055163|e128b05b||Nilfgaardian Nobleman
    505589|00000000||Tried negotiating, making a deal?
    505590|00000000||With van Hoorn? Do you jest? He's a proper heartless bastard. Either play by his rules and pay him, or go out of business.
    505591|00000000||Hm. I see.
    505592|00000000||But I shan't complain. Dumplings have proven an excellent source of income. It's just… well…
   1032337|00000000||You miss the heat of the forge… Tried getting supplies from someone else?
   1032339|00000000||Those rogues of the underworld control all the sources. How am I to talk to them? Unless… would you be willing to help me?
    505503|00000000||Couldn't make a deal?
    505504|00000000||Ernst van Hoorn?
    505510|00000000||Ernst van Hoorn - who's that?
    505511|00000000||Modest beginnings… a small dockside workshop. However, he proved extremely ambitious. He knew he could not compete with other sword makers on skill alone, so he resorted to other methods.
   1032341|00000000||Other methods?
   1032343|00000000||A bit of slander here, buying business debt cheaply and taking over there. And whenever the competition was a "ploughing non-human," he'd accuse them of being havekars.
   1032345|00000000||Is that how he did you in?
   1032347|00000000||I did not give up without a fight. I went to town hall, negotiated. Alas, it was all in vain. He'd already enlisted Cleaver's protection, and in Novigrad few dare get in Cleaver's way.
    505493|00000000||Quite a collection. Premium quality, too.
    505494|00000000||Thank you. I've kept these as mementos.
   1016680|00000000||Damn shame you don't make them anymore. I'd gladly replace what I have with this kind of steel. Someone with your skills - why the hell are you kneading dough?
   1016682|00000000||This might surprise you - the pay is better. But above all, it's much safer. Food vendors rarely disappear or end up as cripples.
   1032333|00000000||I see. Someone controlling Novigrad's smithing market?
   1032335|00000000||Not officially, though… All supplies go through Ernst van Hoorn. And they say he plays cards with Cleaver… frequently.
    569313|00000000||Greetings, Hattori.
    569314|00000000||Greetings, witcher. Why didn't you show? You made a fool of me.
    505618|00000000||Greetings, Hattori. I'm back.
    505620|00000000||Greetings, witcher. Have you considered my offer?
    501674|00000000||Want me to help you get supplies?
    501727|00000000||Want me to help you get your supplies? How?
    501730|00000000||Just come with me to a meeting. As my bodyguard, it'll bolster my confidence. Truth be told, not so long ago I tried negotiating some iron deliveries with one of the King of Beggars' men.
   1032381|00000000||Right, King wouldn't worry about an embargo Cleaver imposed.
   1032383|00000000||Take it he's important in the underworld, too?
   1032385|00000000||Yes. What's more he's on piss poor terms with Cleaver, who backs van Hoorn.
   1037181|00000000||It's just… he demanded an inordinately large share of the profits. I thought you might help me negotiate. I don't mean gratis. I'm certain we can agree on a fee.
   1037183|00000000||Could I… choose something from your collection?
   1037185|00000000||Forget this rubbish! I shall forge you a sword fit for killing gods.
   1037187|00000000||I dunno. Criminal underworld - not really sure I wanna meddle with them.
   1037189|00000000||I badly need your help. Van Hoorn is a van whoreson. He must be taught a lesson. I'd be eternally grateful. Plate armor? Yours! Or perhaps you'd like a catapult or a trebuchet?
    581061|00000000||Sorry, something came up. Be there this time, I promise.
    581062|00000000||Very well. Do you recall where? The crane at the docks. After dark.
   1007115|00000000||All right.
    581060|00000000||I'll show up this time.
    501678|00000000||Sorry. Negotiations? Just not in my line of work.
    501679|00000000||Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
    501675|00000000||Not interested.
    501673|00000000||All right, arrange a meeting.
    534096|00000000||Fine. Arrange the meeting.
    569345|00000000||Splendid. Meet me after dark, near the crane at the docks.
   1046488|00000000||Let's do this: I'll enter the race, you'll bet on me, win, pay your debts, then give me the placards.
   1046490|00000000||You're that good a rider?
   1046492|00000000||Far from the worst. Go tell the count you accept his offer.
   1046467|00000000||I'll win the race for you.
   1046494|00000000||Lemme pay off your debt. No strings attached.
   1046589|00000000||I'm as good as dead. Time to flee to safer climes. Kovir, perhaps?
   1073950|00000000||Chin up.
   1073952|00000000||Come on. There's gotta something we can do.
   1073954|00000000||Alas, I'm afraid all is lost. I had my chance and I squandered it.
   1073956|00000000||I fear Kovir is my last resort.
   1046508|00000000||Dandelion'll have to live without his placards.
   1046510|00000000||Well, guess Dandelion'll have to live without his placards.
   1046512|00000000||I truly regret it worked out this way. Please, convey my apologies to Master Dandelion.
   1046595|00000000||Farewell, friend, and convey to Master Dandelion my kindest regards… and my deepest regrets.
   1046597|00000000||Good idea. Lot of people heading that way these days.
   1046599|00000000||Halflings among them?
   1046601|00000000||Not many, but word is everyone's welcome, regardless of species.
   1046603|00000000||Hmm, then Kovir it is. Perhaps my luck will improve there…
   1046591|00000000||Good idea.
   1046590|00000000||I'll pay your debt.
   1046497|00000000||Thank you. I-I never expected this… May I ask to what I owe this generosity?
   1046499|00000000||Let's just say I like to do a good deed from time to time. Can we get those placards now?
   1046501|00000000||I'll bring them to the Rosemary and Thyme. Just as soon as I settle my obligations.
   1046503|00000000||Fine. See you there.
   1046468|00000000||Lemme pay your debt.
   1046469|00000000||I just want those placards.
   1046471|00000000||Listen, all I really want're the placards. Tell me where you tucked 'em away, and I'll be outta your hair.
   1046480|00000000||Forgive me, I cannot. I hid them with family heirlooms that would work those barbarians lurking outside my home into a slavering froth.
   1046482|00000000||Then go fetch 'em yourself. I'll wait here.
   1046484|00000000||If I show my face there without coin, they'll beat me to a pulp. I must win back my debt somehow, else I'll never return home.
   1046462|00000000||What's there to worry about? This is your chance to settle up, get a clean slate.
   1046464|00000000||I've had a spell of bad luck lately. Should I agree to de Luverten's offer and lose, I shall be in bondage to him for all time.
   1046453|00000000||What's there to worry about?
   1046454|00000000||Who's Count de Luverten?
   1046456|00000000||Generous. Not just anybody could afford to do that.
   1046458|00000000||De Luverten is not just anybody. He's Duke Salm's youngest son. Salm of the well-known family of gem dealers.
   1046460|00000000||One debt more or less makes little difference to him.
   1047859|00000000||And now Count de Luverten has offered me the chance to win it all back… I'm to wager on a race.
   1047883|00000000||Think I might've run into one of them…
   1047885|00000000||Then you know my predicament.
   1046444|00000000||You Rautlec?
   1046446|00000000||Henri Rautlec, artist, painter, debtor and martyr to my art. At your service.
   1046448|00000000||Dandelion sent me.
   1046450|00000000||Oh yes. Tell him his placards are done and safely hidden away. Yet alas, I cannot fetch them as a group of angry creditors has seized my home.
   1046431|00000000||Well, Rautlec, seems you're a considerable sum in the red… But you shan't back out on that account, eh?
   1046433|00000000||Won't have much of a choice before long.
   1046435|00000000||Come now, old sport, we can't allow that! Who'd I wager with then, eh? Listen, here's what we'll do: we'll make one more bet. If you win, I'll pay your debts and we'll continue playing. What do you say?
   1046437|00000000||And if I lose?
   1046439|00000000||One worry at a time, old chum! Well, I'm off to place my bet.
   1061961|05edbbdd||Horse
    490625|00000000||I found a letter… From a spy.
    490634|00000000||I found a letter to Menge, from someone important. A spy, I think.
    490636|00000000||A spy?
    490638|00000000||Take a look.
    490640|00000000||Drop boxes, secret signals… Yeah… Strong stench of spy craft here… This agent could know more about Dandelion.
   1065638|00000000||Bet he does. Letters explains how to signal for a meeting - no mention of where it would take place.
   1065640|00000000||Maybe Dijkstra can help. He knows everything.
   1065642|00000000||Everything? Slight exaggeration there.
   1065644|00000000||I'm not so sure.
   1074501|00000000||Find anything?
    490218|00000000||Just his office key in his pockets. Here… Nothing under his belt… Wait! Something's sewn in the lining…
    490220|00000000||What is it?
    490222|00000000||The key to a vault.
    490224|00000000||Here. Give it to Dijkstra with my regards.
    490685|00000000||All right. Nothing left for us here. Let's go.
   1065409|00000000||Be glad to. Just not by way of the main gate.
    490624|00000000||Let's get going.
    490626|00000000||Kinda doubt the key'll be enough.
    490632|00000000||Key to a vault? No address? Why do I doubt this'll make Dijkstra smile?
    490731|00000000||Well, might keep him from setting his thugs on us, breaking our legs for failing to fulfill our part of the bargain.
    496461|00000000||Meaning, glass is half full?
    496463|00000000||Of something strong, I hope…
   1045734|00000000||You'll regret this, mutant!
   1025866|00000000||I like it here. Excellent decor, it's calm, quiet…
   1025868|00000000||It's not always quiet. Once, I was alone in the sauna… Argh, you'll laugh.
   1025870|00000000||You must finish now you've begun! Well?
   1025872|00000000||Well, I was in the sauna… And I heard a sort of growling coming from below. "Maaargh. Buerrgh" - something like that.
   1025874|00000000||Come, now… It was surely your belly growling. You must have sat there too long on an empty stomach. Speaking of… shall we dine?
    475084|00000000||That everythin'? That all you got?
    475086|00000000||It's all. I swear on me poor nipper's grave, sir.
    475088|00000000||Here. Eat up.
    475090|00000000||Thank you kindly…
    475092|00000000||Won't be no use to anyone if you starve to death.
    475147|00000000||What on earth… What've you done to our boys?!
    475151|00000000||Some white-haired freak… Cut down our boys like he was cuttin' pigs!
    475149|00000000||Talk!
   1045426|00000000||Why're you asking me?
   1045431|00000000||Why're you asking me?
   1045433|00000000||Well, the lovely lady seems to be havin' a hard time decidin'. And Master Dandelion said he was torn between boudoir style and theater décor, but that he'd let us know just as soon as we arrived.
   1021661|00000000||Dandelion is doing this for you, you decide.
   1021671|00000000||Sure, I've known him longer, but he's never so much as changed his socks for me. Never mind commissioning a full-blown renovation.
   1045502|00000000||He's doing this for you, clearly. You should decide.
   1021660|00000000||Boudoir style's the better fit for cabaret.
   1021666|00000000||Boudoir seems like a better fit for cabaret. Just don't go overboard on stuffed upholstery.
   1045731|00000000||I think so, too.
   1045785|00000000||True enough. Adheres to the principle that a life enjoyed is a life well lived.
   1045787|00000000||You needn't mock.
   1045789|00000000||I'm not. I mean that. Nothing wrong with the principle - Dandelion just knows how to enjoy life. It's a good thing.
   1045817|00000000||Dandelion can also be responsible. He always pays anyone who works for him on time… And he's never missed a performance.
   1045959|00000000||Sure hope your opening won't be the first. He's still not here.
   1045961|00000000||Well, he said as soon as he'd got the coin, he'd go see Polly, our choreographer. She's missed the last few rehearsals.
   1045963|00000000||I certainly hope he's not gotten into trouble.
   1045965|00000000||Anything's possible with Dandelion. Lemme see if I can't find him.
   1045764|00000000||We talking about the same Dandelion? Man who loses a fortune worth half of Novigrad in one night?
   1045730|00000000||Dandelion, a rationalist? Don't think so.
   1045715|00000000||Well, well, guess this cabaret's the real thing.
   1045775|00000000||Ever since Dandelion inherited this place he's talked about it constantly. I just never expected him to… take action. And so quickly.
   1045777|00000000||Who knows, might even settle down now. He'll have to keep an eye on the business. Who would've known…
   1045779|00000000||Despite what people say about him, Dandelion approaches life very rationally.
   1022702|00000000||A wonderful choice it is! At last!
   1045504|00000000||Gentlemen, you're done lollygaggin'! Get to work!
   1021672|00000000||I associate boudoirs with a feminine elegance that also has an edge - claws, you might say. That fits a cabaret perfectly.
   1045697|00000000||Hmm… Both our lives have revolved around the stage, and cabaret is a form of theater, in a way… Fine, let's do the theater décor. I certainly hope it will be to his liking.
   1021662|00000000||You're both stage artists, and cabaret's a form of theater. Interior should reflect that.
   1021659|00000000||Cabaret's theater of a kind. The décor should be theatrical.
   1045450|00000000||Now we're here, but no decision's been made. And the lady's horribly surprised she's to choose, though apparently this whole renovation's for her sake.
   1045452|00000000||For me?
   1045454|00000000||Well it's not for me. Now would ye please decide 'fore I burst a vessel?!
   1045456|00000000||I've no idea what Dandelion would like. Geralt, you've known him longer. Say something.
   1045435|00000000||Hmm… What're our choices?
   1045439|00000000||Master Dandelion said he was torn between boudoir style and theater décor. Promised to let us know his choice soon as we arrived.
   1045425|00000000||What're our choices?
   1043826|00000000||There's been a misunderstanding! You're here too early!
   1045382|00000000||We agreed to meet today, so we've come today. Supplies're all hauled in, and me crew's rarin' to work.
   1045384|00000000||We'll start just as soon as our lovely directress gets 'round to decidin' on the decoration.
   1045386|00000000||But Dandelion doesn't even have the coin to pay you!
   1043828|00000000||Turns out he does now. Or soon will. At any rate, he's working on it.
   1045388|00000000||See? It's all peachy. So, will ye finally decide what style ye want for this interior?
   1042109|00000000||Don't ye worry, sir, it'll be a belter!
   1045973|00000000||If Master Dandelion's goin' to such lengths for his lass, we sure can't let 'im down!
   1044934|00000000||What're ye doin'? Knockin'-off time already?
   1045370|00000000||Nay, just hopped out for a smoke.
   1045372|00000000||They still arguin'?
   1045374|00000000||Seems they can't decide on a color now.
   1045376|00000000||Don't know what the fuckin' problem is.
   1045378|00000000||A color's either pretty or ugly. Ain't no philosophy to it.
    302053|67827706||Temple Guard
   1010943|00000000||Fuck off.
   1010939|00000000||Hey, whitey! Why'd your hair go white?
   1010937|00000000||Not bad for a freak of nature.
   1010931|00000000||Ha!
   1010933|00000000||You brute!
   1086630|00000000||Been to Novigrad.
   1086629|00000000||She disappeared from Novigrad, too. Checked that. Thanks for helping her.
    521099|00000000||Sorry. Just don't have the time.
    521122|00000000||What'll happen if I don't go with you?
    521124|00000000||To you? Nothin'. Though I'll probably lose a few more men in the swamps. I'm determined to make this journey.
    521126|00000000||I'll think about it.
    521127|00000000||Fuck thinkin'. Just help me. I'll gather my men and ride to Downwarren. Once you've mulled it over, join us there.
    456777|00000000||What was that?
    392701|00000000||You tell me. Man or monster? My men call him Uma and say he's a beast, but he seems a man to me, just hideous as Ardal's shit.
    405281|00000000||Ha… Funny indeed.
    405285|00000000||Hilarious. Real side-splitter.
    405287|00000000||Ohh, you wouldn't know a good tale from a runny fart.
    405263|00000000||Nothing better to play for?
    405269|00000000||Must've been pretty desperate to play for that.
    405271|00000000||Ah, quit your carping, smartarse. Someone wagered him, and we played. If anyone was desperate, it was the bugger's former master.
    405265|00000000||Tell me how it happened.
    405273|00000000||Funny story? How so?
    405275|00000000||Went to Novigrad once, to rest, indulge in the city's pleasures. Stayed at a tavern, and some folk there were playin', so I joined in.
    405277|00000000||Cards were kind that day. Had one devilish hand after another, robbed the whoresons blind. One fellow, a merchant, took it especially hard. He'd gambled away everything he'd brought from Skellige. Wanted terribly to play another hand, so I agreed.
    405279|00000000||Asked him what he had to wager, and he showed me that sideshow. Not much in it for me, but fuck it, I thought - I'll give the man a chance to win something back. Luck was not with him, and Uma wound up here at Crow's Perch. End of story.
    405283|00000000||Now you've got a court jester.
    405289|00000000||Proper baron now - even got a jester.
    405327|00000000||Aye… Though I feel something's not right with him.
    405329|00000000||How so?
    405331|00000000||Well, he seems more beast than man, but there's wisdom, cunning in the bastard's eyes. Or maybe I'm imagining it. Ever run into anything like him?
    405355|00000000||No. But he doesn't look dangerous.
    405365|00000000||Hmm… I guess that's that. Doesn't eat much, so as long as he's no trouble, the boys might as well have some diversion.
    405367|00000000||Time I was on my way. So long.
    391899|00000000||Don't know who or what your Uma is, but I know he's linked to Ciri somehow.
    392719|00000000||What? Ah, c'mon, pull the other one. How on earth could that thing be tied to your daughter?
    392723|00000000||Don't know yet. Gotta find a way to talk to him.
    391901|00000000||Hmm… I guess you've no reason to lie. Come back once you've found out how.
    392733|00000000||Till then he'll be safe here. 'Cause I don't imagine you know how to drag him around with you.
    391903|00000000||Fine. In that case, I'm off. So long, Baron.
    392735|00000000||Farewell. I hope you find your daughter.
    414220|00000000||And prove a good father to her…
    391918|00000000||Definitely man, trapped by a powerful curse. And linked somehow to Ciri.
    391920|00000000||What do you mean? How can that thing be tied to your Ciri?
    391922|00000000||Long story, but I know he's the key to finding her. I need to take him to Kaer Morhen. Maybe the other witchers can help me lift the curse.
    391924|00000000||Hmm… If it'll help you find your daughter, I'd be a pure bastard to refuse. Take him.
    456900|00000000||He has a corner in the stables, I'll tell my men not to give you trouble.
    456903|00000000||The witcher here's gonna take Uma. No one's to get in his way.
    456905|00000000||Aye, sir.
    392748|00000000||Thanks, Baron. So long.
    456800|00000000||He's connected to Ciri.
    456802|00000000||Where'd he get the name?
    456872|00000000||Where'd you find him?
    456876|00000000||Where'd you find him?
    456874|00000000||Funny story, actually. I won him in a game of cards.
    392640|00000000||Hmm… Doesn't look like a monster, but my medallion's trembling. Strange. Where'd you find him?
    456796|00000000||Doesn't look like a monster.
    456798|00000000||Where'd he get the name?
    456808|00000000||Uma? Strange name.
    456858|00000000||Aye, strange. But he gave us no other.
    456860|00000000||You mean he can talk?
    456862|00000000||Hardly… It was like this - I asked what they call him. He sat there, not sayin' a thing, tryin' to stick a toe up his nose.
    456864|00000000||So I grabbed his hand, looked him in the eyes and asked, "What's your name?" Gave me this damned foolish look and stammered, "Oooh… Uma?" And it stuck.
    456804|00000000||So, witcher! How do you like my court jester?
    456806|00000000||Maybe you can tell - is he man or beast? My men call him Uma, claim he's a monster, but seems to me he's a man, just hideous as Ardal's shit.
   1086632|00000000||What the…?
    504042|00000000||There you are!
    504044|00000000||Escaped again.
    504046|00000000||Sorry. We was never here.
    521101|00000000||Hmm… Extra coin never hurt.
    521118|00000000||Hah! True indeed! I'll round up my men and ride to Downwarren. You can join us there.
    521120|00000000||Fine. Sounds good.
    521098|00000000||You convinced me. I'll go.
    516945|00000000||It's nothin'. Now you've learned what you wanted to know, you must be in a hurry - but… if you could…
    521093|00000000||Spit it out.
    516946|00000000||I want to go get Anna. Free her, bring her back. I don't believe she's there willingly.
    532545|00000000||Must've not heard me. Any journey into the swamp is suicide.
    532547|00000000||I heard you - which is why I could use your aid.
    521096|00000000||I've no more tales of Ciri to offer you, but go with me and I'll be generous with what I do have. Very generous.
    392637|00000000||So there's a chance Ciri's still in Novigrad… Thanks for helping her.
    392635|00000000||Gotta go to Novigrad.
    402864|00000000||Where'd you get these letters?
    402866|00000000||Haven't always led this pack of jesters. Served in the Temerian army once.
    402871|00000000||Redanians guard the crossing.
    402873|00000000||True, but with a bit of fame and a friend here and there… well, banners and heraldry don't mean so much.
    402860|00000000||Where did you get these letters?
    392579|00000000||How'd Ciri get past the Redanian blockade?
    392631|00000000||Redanian army's blocked the Pontar crossing, yet you sent Ciri to Novigrad.
    402796|00000000||She was looking for a sorceress, and all of them are in Novigrad. Besides, I didn't leave her at the Redanians' mercy. I gave her a letter of safe conduct.
    402852|00000000||Who was the letter to?
    402854|00000000||No one. It was like this one. Show that to those pricks at the crossing and they'll let you pass.
    402856|00000000||This for me?
    402858|00000000||See no reason to make things harder for you. You seek your child, this letter will help.
    392514|00000000||She mounted and rode off. It grew awfully empty without her…
   1025757|00000000||Branches're near heavy with blossoms. Good harvest comin' this year.
   1025759|00000000||If the war don't pass through afore autumn, you mean to say…
   1025761|00000000||Ealdorman said Radovid's got the Black Ones near licked. A month, two, and he'll push 'em back beyond the Yaruga!
   1025763|00000000||Ealdorman'd be flogged if he said otherwise. For contradictin' the king.
    589627|00000000||Oh!
    589628|00000000||Find your damned own spot.
    589624|00000000||Yes, yes… we'll soon return. But no one's even noticed we're gone.
    589625|00000000||Heehee.
   1007405|00000000||Once I begin, you must all enter your homes, shut the windows, lock the doors.
   1007406|00000000||I don't like this. Shouldn't be riskin' your life for us. But… we'll do as you say.
   1007409|00000000||Animal sacrifice?
   1007410|00000000||Should we burn folk at the stake as they do on the Continent? Better a sacrifice of goats and sheep, I think.
   1007412|00000000||Blota himmel! Blota mylla!
   1007414|00000000||Damn… Lots of 'em.
   1018055|00000000||Blota himmel, blota mylla, braka och blixtar!
   1056933|00000000||Rhunu duku! Djabba djar! Akunda mundulus!
    496163|00000000||Agh! Agh! Dammit!
    496621|00000000||I can't leave him like that!
    446585|00000000||When will this nightmare end…?
    446583|00000000||Alone! All have left me…
   1006701|00000000||Herbs… Roots…? Triss turn to healing?
   1036973|00000000||Listen, there's one other thing I wanted to talk about. But not here and definitely not now. Come by later, when you have a moment? I'd appreciate it. All right. We need to get out of here.
    481059|00000000||This is where we split up. But first… let's burn this shack down.
    489917|00000000||Agreed. We've left too much evidence.
    489919|00000000||Yeah. But I also need to blow off some steam.
    565721|773cef90||Brean Hotsch
    553562|00000000||Let's see what's up there.
   1054359|00000000||Oy! Here's our hero's! I'll drink to your health, witcher!
   1051517|00000000||Gods and men - dumbstruck with awe!
   1051519|00000000||Behold madly galloping poetry!
   1049391|00000000||A new rider pulls into the lead!
   1049394|00000000||A miracle on four hooves!
   1051515|00000000||Look at that horse barrel ahead!
   1051509|00000000||Pure harmony between jockey and steed!
   1051511|00000000||You'd think them a pair of old lovers!
   1051513|00000000||Synergy reigns between them!
    465467|05df8c2c||Golem
    511562|00000000||Dwarves were thorough as debt collectors. Didn't leave a scrap.
    511561|00000000||Place's been scrubbed clean…
    511560|00000000||Nothing interesting here.
    406279|00000000||More cautious than I thought. Can't get too close.
    406277|00000000||He's sensed something… Gotta stay further back.
   1004420|00000000||Got to go to the woods again…
   1004421|00000000||Weren't it recent you went to see 'em?
   1004422|00000000||Aye, and I swore to bring an offerin'.
   1004423|00000000||What is it you give the Ladies? As thanks.
   1004424|00000000||You'll find out soon as you need their help.
   1052692|00000000||Thought I'd catch a few hares, get a bit o' meat… There'd be the furs to trade, too.
   1052775|00000000||Toiled half the day settin' up traps…
   1052777|00000000||And come evenin' the barons men had ruined everythin'.
   1052779|00000000||Aye! Went flyin' through on their horses! Again! Whoresons!
   1062770|00000000||Good luck to you, sorceress. Come back and see us, eh? Dare say here's the only place you'll feel welcome…
   1006556|00000000||You even have a motive?
   1006568|00000000||Got a reason for killing? A reason to torture?
   1006570|00000000||Hm, I thought you'd figure that out as well. The symbolism's rather obvious. Coals for those who are blind to the Fire. The egg of a salamander, born of fire, to replace their cold, doubting hearts. Fire down the throat that--
   1006572|00000000||Yeah, symbolism's clear. What's not is why a vampire would kill in the name of the Eternal Fire.
   1006574|00000000||Should be equally obvious - I concur with the Church's diagnosis. Novigrad is a fallen city, its population amnesiacs to the very concepts of decency and morality. So I decided to remind them. In a manner they'd be certain to notice.
   1006622|00000000||There are other ways.
   1006640|00000000||There are other ways. Could've set up a soap box in Hierarch Square, preached from it.
   1006642|00000000||How funny. That's exactly what I did. But none listened. Instead they laughed, threw stones.
   1006630|00000000||Give a thought to my victims. A lecherous woodcarver who'd spend his last copper on whores. An old countess who defiled symbols of the Faith. A trobairitz for whom nothing was sacred, nothing above ridicule.
   1006632|00000000||They did not deserve to live. But their deaths could be a lesson to others. Awaken them, scare them onto the correct path, the path to the Fire, to cleansing, to salvation.
   1006634|00000000||For you, I'm afraid it's too late. You are a man of little faith. I sense this.
   1006636|00000000||Mhm. But I'm pretty good with a sword.
   1006638|00000000||"Pretty good" might not cut it.
   1006646|00000000||Tortured logic.
   1006648|00000000||Yet logic nonetheless. I'm glad you perceived that, at least. Fight fire with fire, as they say.
   1006576|00000000||Twisted logic.
   1006575|00000000||You're outta your fucking mind.
   1006624|00000000||You're a sick fuck.
   1006626|00000000||I never expected you to understand. You're a cynic and an opportunist, I sensed it from the start. Ah well, this conversation has grown unpleasant for both parties… We must move to the next item on the agenda.
   1006564|00000000||I last fought a witcher two centuries ago. I do hope I remember how it's done.
   1006566|00000000||And you? Have you faced one of us? No, you couldn't have. You'd not have survived.
   1006558|00000000||Good to know this was the work of a monster, not a human.
   1006560|00000000||Believe me. Worse things go on in this city than my little… spectacles. Far worse.
   1006562|00000000||Afraid you won't get the chance to tell me about them. 'Cause I'm gonna kill you.
   1006555|00000000||Get ready to die.
   1006546|00000000||Run out of formaldehyde?
   1006548|00000000||I underestimated you. You almost caught me in flagrante delicto, now you've seen through my bluff with Nathaniel…
   1006550|00000000||Although… you've not divined all, I see. Had you, you would've drawn your silver sword.
   1006552|00000000||Who… What are you?
   1006554|00000000||A vampire - higher, of course.
    532635|00000000||Really rather not hurt you…
    532638|00000000||Listen, I'd really rather not hurt you…
    532639|00000000||Stop patronizing me or you'll be the one to get hurt! Now en garde!
    532636|00000000||If that's what the lady wishes… Just don't wanna see anyone crying later.
    532637|00000000||I've a hanky for you, just in case. En garde!
    532634|00000000||As you wish.
    532631|00000000||Here. You see, I thought that instead of training in a dank old cellar, we'd move around in the open air. A duel on a bridge, like in the novels. Now draw your sword!
    532632|00000000||Only got my steel and silver swords. We should be fighting with practice weapons.
    532633|00000000||We should. But you of all people ought to know - there's much more fun in doing things you shouldn't.
   1075301|00000000||Footprints and pawprints crisscross. Man and beast…
    488991|00000000||The prints crisscross… Morkvarg followed Craven from the start.
   1075320|00000000||Man, under twenty, multiple wounds. Found shelter here… and bled to death.
   1043683|00000000||Found Craven… Now to look for the key. Won't get out of here without it.
   1075314|00000000||Monster's blood.
    489056|00000000||Morkvarg's blood.
   1075322|00000000||Human blood. Lots of it. Deep wound, must've been.
    488954|00000000||Craven's blood…
   1075318|00000000||Claw marks… Huge claws.
    489573|00000000||Morkvarg doesn't give up easily…
   1075297|00000000||Blood, ground's all dug up… Site of a fight, no doubt.
    488985|00000000||Craven hid here… then struck.
   1075293|00000000||Footprintslk, light ones - someone was being stealthy.
    488955|00000000||Light prints… Craven trod carefully.
    489728|00000000||One of Freya's priestesses. No signs of violence. Must've died of hunger… a while ago.
    489729|00000000||A key - could come in handy.
    492154|00000000||Must've hid here when Morkvarg raided the garden.
   1075299|00000000||Deep prints, blood… Just trying to get away.
    488990|00000000||Fighting was the last thing on Craven's mind by this point… Ran as fast as he could.
   1075295|00000000||Prints… deep, spaced far apart. A runner.
    488984|00000000||Craven was injured. Started running.
   1075316|00000000||Footprints. Lead to the well… And end there.
    495444|00000000||Prints lead to the well. Guess Craven didn't wanna be eaten, preferred to drown.
   1075312|00000000||Claws… Really wanted to get inside. Desperate, almost.
    488997|00000000||Claw marks… Craven slammed the door in Morkvarg's face.
   1075310|00000000||Monster tracks… Running, chasing something.
    488994|00000000||Deep, spaced-out prints… Morkvarg started running after Craven.
   1075291|00000000||Blood - human.
   1043710|00000000||Craven's blood. Flowing profusely… Trail's clear. Should lead me to him.
   1075303|00000000||Fight happened here.
    488993|00000000||Looks like Morkvarg got bored of sneaking around… And attacked.
    489008|00000000||Door won't budge… Craven must've blocked it… or it's just locked… Gotta go around.
    489007|00000000||Sanctuary of some kind…
    488996|00000000||Lots of blood… and it's not human. Craven managed to wound Morkvarg.
    489079|00000000||Something down there. Can't see a thing.
    488058|00000000||The flood gate's open… but nothing's happening.
    525461|00000000||Lots of prints… old and new. His lair must be nearby.
    489730|00000000||Waited a long time for death to come.
    489006|00000000||Morkvarg was on his trail again here.
    498227|00000000||I can't climb that. Need to find another way.
   1056867|00000000||Gotta get to the other side. The low road, maybe? If I can open the sluice…
    489003|00000000||These prints should lead me to Craven… or his body.
    488995|00000000||Two deep prints, then nothing. Morkvarg must've jumped.
    489535|00000000||Morkvarg was wounded… Didn't give up, though.
    499604|00000000||Hoof prints…
    489047|00000000||Craven's blood…
    489021|00000000||No sign of Craven, and no way out… Except the well…
    499602|00000000||Typical fisherman's boat… smashed on the rocks.
   1025552|00000000||Alms, alms for bread, please, good folk.
   1025554|00000000||Naye, not like that. Draw it out more - "breeeeaaaad."
   1025556|00000000||What difference will it make?
   1025558|00000000||A great one. Drawn out it sounds like a babe wailin'. You know, subliminal messagin'.
   1025560|00000000||You're a clever bugger after all, Professor!
    490788|00000000||Don't play the tough guy. Not worth it.
    490796|00000000||You'll talk. Just a matter of time. So save us some, yourself some, too, and stop acting tough.
    490798|00000000||Or what?
    490800|00000000||Or I'll have to hurt you. Permanently.
    490802|00000000||I see you know your way around an interrogation… So do I. You're the bad one, all threats and torture, and the red one's the good one, full of sympathy and sweet promises…
    490804|00000000||That's where you're wrong.
    490846|00000000||Triss… That's enough.
    490892|00000000||Triss, stop.
    490894|00000000||First let him--
    490896|00000000||Please.
    490905|00000000||Depends… on the question.
    491060|00000000||Take his memory.
    491079|00000000||Strip him of his memory.
    491081|00000000||But… But I helped you… I help--
    491083|00000000||It's not so bad. I promise.
    491085|00000000||Caesle, angaef.
    491137|00000000||Showed your claws today.
    491146|00000000||Really showed your claws today…
    491148|00000000||Is that how you see it? I'd put it differently. I showed how little I differ from these bastards.
    491150|00000000||I… Let's finish up and leave. I want to go home, bathe… and get drunk.
    491161|00000000||Said you had an idea - about freeing Dandelion…
    491163|00000000||Yes… We know he's on the island. And he'll stay there until Menge orders him transferred to Oxenfurt, right?
    491185|00000000||Mhm. Problem is Menge's dead, so…
    491187|00000000||No one else knows that. He could've escaped the fire… He could reappear… Him, or someone very, very similar.
    491165|00000000||A doppler?
    491167|00000000||Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt, impersonated the halfling merchant. Dandelion claimed he seemed more real than the original. So much so Vivaldi gave him a loan of several thousand crowns without batting an eye.
    491169|00000000||Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding right now. Priscilla might know something, though.
    491171|00000000||Fingers crossed.
    491158|00000000||Mentioned you have an idea about how to free Dandelion.
    491159|00000000||I'll walk you home.
    491181|00000000||Walk you home…?
    491183|00000000||Not today, Geralt. Not today.
   1036969|00000000||But… There is one other thing I wanted to talk about. So, mind coming by later? Menge's dead, true, but that hardly marks the end of my troubles.
    491140|00000000||How do you feel?
    491142|00000000||Base. Cruel. Vile.
    491144|00000000||I could go on… but I need to get out of here - now. Go home, bathe… then drink myself to oblivion.
    491136|00000000||Triss… how are you?
    491062|00000000||As good as lit the pyres with Menge in the square. He deserves to die.
    491074|00000000||But… But I helped you… I help--
    491076|00000000||Faeren, angau.
    491059|00000000||Kill him.
    491048|00000000||Enough… We've learned everything we wanted to.
    491050|00000000||Glad to hear it. Can I assume we can put this unfortunate incident behind us and…
    491052|00000000||Not so fast. Geralt…
    491054|00000000||I know. He's seen too much.
    491056|00000000||But why… I told you… I'll never…
    491058|00000000||Either he dies… Or I wipe his mind.
    490929|00000000||Enough.
    490987|00000000||Expect an apology?
    490991|00000000||You expect an apology?
    490993|00000000||No… But I've a right to be surprised, haven't I?
    490995|00000000||Dandelion is on Temple Isle. In the dungeon beneath the shrine. Menge's planning to execute him in Oxenfurt… Positively spectacular.
    490997|00000000||Afraid you'll have to call off the show.
    496121|00000000||How can we free Dandelion?
    490999|00000000||Those who leave Temple Isle do so only on Menge's orders… Issued in person.
    491003|00000000||Dammit…
    491009|00000000||We'll find a way. I have an idea. Tell you later.
    490989|00000000||Get to the point.
    490986|00000000||Get to the point.
    490942|00000000||We're looking for Dandelion. We know Menge captured him.
    490944|00000000||Th-that? That's what this is all about? A fucking minstrel?
    490975|00000000||You might've said so from the start. Before you bloody started mucking my mind with magic?
    496119|00000000||I can't believe it… For a miserable sap like that…
    490899|00000000||We're looking for Dandelion.
    496091|00000000||Where'd Menge hide Sigi Reuven's treasure?
    496093|00000000||I… I haven't a clue.
    496095|00000000||You realize - one word and you'll howl with pain again?
    496097|00000000||Yeah - and yet I still say I don't know a thing. Does that make you think?
    496123|00000000||Think he's telling the truth?
    496125|00000000||Looks like it.
    496081|00000000||I'm looking for Sigi Reuven's treasure.
    491040|00000000||Radovid - what'd he hope to gain by helping Menge?
    491042|00000000||He seeks to clear the field. Before he arrives.
    491044|00000000||Makes sense. Easier to take a city whose mages are gone.
    491046|00000000||Bastard… he'll pay for this.
    490903|00000000||What did Radovid hope to achieve?
    490900|00000000||Who do you work for?
    490977|00000000||Pure curiosity… Who do you work for?
    490979|00000000||Won't say. No way.
    490981|00000000||Sure about that?
    490985|00000000||Yes. No matter what you do, witch… That I will never reveal.
    490983|00000000||Hgh ugh hghgh... Radovid. I work for Radovid.
    490907|00000000||Yes, yes! Just tell me what the fuck about!
    490898|00000000||So? Gonna talk?
    490888|00000000||You must be thinking: this can't possibly hurt any worse… Oh, it can.
    490890|00000000||Aaarrgh! Enough…ugh! Enough!
    490845|00000000||[Don't react.]
    490836|00000000||Aaaaaargh!
    490838|00000000||Had enough?
    490840|00000000||Ffffff… Fffffuck off… I can take this…
    490842|00000000||Of course you can. But I'm just getting started.
    490844|00000000||Aaargh!
    490790|00000000||That's no way to talk to a lady.
    490792|00000000||To a lady, I'd never… but to a witch?
    490794|00000000||You can. Wouldn't recommend it, though.
    490787|00000000||That's no way to talk to a lady.
    490779|00000000||Menge?
    490782|00000000||Indisposed. Very indisposed.
    490832|00000000||I don't know who you are… But you're in deep. Shit right up to your nostrils.
    488989|00000000||You're in deeper, I assure you… But answer our questions, and we'll help you get out.
    490786|00000000||My answer to each question will be the same: sod off.
   1065850|00000000||Triss? How'd you know to-- Ah, Dijkstra, huh?
   1065852|00000000||None other. I couldn't resist… Really want to see this through to the end.
    491094|00000000||Perfect place for a tryst… with Triss…
    491096|00000000||Mhm… Ceiling's collapsed, mold on the walls, mouse droppings in the corner… Lips almost pucker on their own…
    491097|00000000||Shh. He's coming. Hide.
   1036971|00000000||See you soon, Geralt.
   1006679|00000000||Hairbrush - only ever known Triss to use one like this.
   1052706|00000000||You know Novigrad, tell me, where do I look for mages?
   1052708|00000000||It's not about finding the right place. You just need the right helpers.
   1052710|00000000||All right. Who're they?
   1052712|00000000||Everyone. Just flash some coin… and if that don't work, haul them in for interrogation.
    558364|00000000||Soon will rise thy dead, thy buried. Each will say by what they're harried.
    558363|00000000||What is this life? Well ye know. Fleeting torment ere we go.
    561669|00000000||What comes next, once life subsides? Man his own fate decides.
    583626|00000000||There are six inside. I wasn't able to get the door open.
    583627|00000000||Gotta find another way in, then.
    511918|00000000||Well, well. Pauper with a library, imagine that.
    516797|00000000||Vile times when beggars can put letters together, foul their minds.
    516798|00000000||The Fire will cleanse them all.
   1032933|00000000||I need a belt set with silver studs.
   1032935|00000000||I'll have it for you next week.
   1032937|00000000||I was here last week and you also told me to come next week.
   1032939|00000000||Exactly. Next week.
   1032941|00000000||But this week is the next week of which you spoke last week!
   1032943|00000000||No. This week is this week. Next week won't come till next week.
   1054353|00000000||I know some frown upon you, but to me, you're a hero!
    355317|00000000||Am I ever lucky I ran into ye. Thanks for your help, and wise council.
    464953|00000000||Here's some more: go home, burn those clothes, and scrub yourself thoroughly.
    464955|00000000||Oh, sure, sure. But I tell ye true - no blight can touch me!
    464957|00000000||Sure hope so. Farewell.
    458126|b6ba5e9b||Courtesan
    418897|00000000||Don't... leave me!
    418891|00000000||Millie, we gotta flee! Quick now!
    453413|00000000||Millie? Millie, what's with ye?
    418893|00000000||I dunno… So hot… burnin' - agh!
    418895|00000000||What? No, no, stay back!
    426275|00000000||Won't have good news for the woman. Wild dogs killed her man.
   1054335|00000000||Run, 'fore your arse grows sore from all the kissin'!
    562674|00000000||Curds? Curds and whey? Not one raspberry, not a drop of honey? Lean times, indeed…
    573109|00000000||Inhabitant clearly left in a hurry.
    573110|00000000||Whole building's shaking… But a specter would've attacked me already.
    573111|00000000||Air flowing through this crack. There's something in there.
    573112|00000000||No one's been here in a while.
    573113|00000000||Not the root of any ordinary plant. Must be magic.
    573114|00000000||Hm, looks like a journal.
    573115|00000000||Something clicked…
    573116|00000000||An earth elemental. Pretty powerful, too.
    573117|00000000||Almost managed to break its magic bonds. A few days more and it would've wreaked havoc all around.
    573118|00000000||Ceiling would've caved in if not for this support.
    573119|00000000||I was sure that would collapse on my head.
    573134|00000000||Wall seems a little thin.
   1016036|00000000||Gotta go deeper. Need to open the passage somehow.
   1021075|00000000||Old and congealed. Wonder if this is where the witch hunters caught up to the mage…?
   1021102|00000000||Scattered salt… Probably to drive ghosts away. Huh, pointless superstition.
   1022281|00000000||Gotta free it first… Then defeat it.
    573108|00000000||So, this is the haunted house…
    366582|00000000||Let's get out of here!
    366590|00000000||He's seen too much.
   1073664|00000000||What're you talking about?
   1073669|00000000||What? A permit?
   1074121|00000000||In accordance with decree 1408--
   1074123|00000000||Tell it to me straight, like a human being.
   1073671|00000000||King Radovid has decided only those with a valid transit permit may cross the Pontar.
   1074127|00000000||Who issues these permits?
   1074129|00000000||I'm not authorized to divulge that information.
   1073656|00000000||Halt!
   1074111|00000000||As per decree number 1408/DZ/54 of His Royal Majesty King Radovid V, passage over the bridge is possible only upon demonstration of a requisite permit.
   1074602|00000000||Farewell.
   1073677|00000000||Farewell.
   1073665|00000000||Farewell.
   1073663|00000000||I have a pass.
   1073673|00000000||Here.
   1073675|00000000||Hm… Numbered… Dated… Signed by the Marshal of Civil Defense and the ambassador…
   1074149|00000000||Seems to be in order. Move on through.
   1074608|00000000||This what you mean?
   1074610|00000000||Let me look at that…
   1074745|00000000||Hmm… Hmm… Missing a seal, the red one…
   1074747|00000000||Impossible…
   1074749|00000000||Department of Civil Defense, forgot again… They're really off their heads these days.
   1074751|00000000||Happens. So be it. You may come through.
   1074600|00000000||I've got a pass.
   1074704|00000000||Who ordered the city gates closed?
   1074721|00000000||Word is, the king himself.
   1074723|00000000||Doesn't want paupers and refugees pissing all over his beautiful city.
   1074725|00000000||Apart from which, when folk can go hither and thither, always a chance some spy'll slink through. This way, spy's got it harder…
   1074735|00000000||So, no pass, no passage.
   1074684|00000000||Who's restricted access to the city?
   1074601|00000000||What kind of pass are we talking about?
   1074604|00000000||What kind of pass're we talking about?
   1074606|00000000||Well, a normal one, a transit pass.
   1074687|00000000||Who issues them?
   1074693|00000000||How should I know? I'm a lowly soldier…
   1074754|00000000||Halt! You'll need to present a pass if want to cross.
   1074599|00000000||Halt! No passage.
   1074666|00000000||Case of the plague surface in the city or something?
   1074671|00000000||The plague? Errr, no. We're to not let folk in the city. It's an order, so I don't. Unless someone's got a pass.
    422083|00000000||Interested in books? You don't look the scholar, but… we've ones with drawings as well.
   1086496|00000000||Play cards, maybe?
    422091|00000000||Farewell.
    422087|00000000||Farewell.
    422085|00000000||Lemme have a look.
    422089|00000000||Let's see these books of yours.
    498438|00000000||You're back.
    452419|00000000||You shall die for what you've done…
    452421|00000000||I've done nothing! Gentlemen! I beg you!
    452423|00000000||Back off! Don't dare interfere.
    452425|00000000||Please - I've a wife, children! Mercy…
    452427|00000000||Too late, poisoner… You must die…
    403987|00000000||Help me!
    170811|72cb8ee5||Drowner
   1072696|00000000||One of 'em's got a key.
    449626|00000000||Hey, there! Sir! A witcher, right? Wait!
    449628|00000000||Gone daft? Mixin' a witcher into this?
   1029461|00000000||Witchers help folk, defend 'em. Maybe this'un will help us.
    448227|00000000||Don't you worry, Bertram, we shan't give ye up.
    448229|00000000||Mean you're to risk your own lives, your families' lives?
    465404|00000000||You're one of us. And we take care of our own.
   1052557|00000000||Got a pass?
   1052559|00000000||Come, we don't need a pass, we're from Novigrad, eight generations and more! The war caught us in Vizima, business, you know, but…
   1052561|00000000||No pass, no passage.
   1052563|00000000||Please, have mercy! Don't turn us back to Velen! You don't know what it's like there!
   1052565|00000000||And you don't seem you know what it's like when a soldier disobeys orders. Telling you for the last time. No pass, no passage.
   1079773|c1075e6c||Griffin
    460861|00000000||Crossing's closed!
    460897|00000000||Come through.
    460859|00000000||No passage!
    499661|00000000||Hrrr all… I have hrrr… in the chapter house hrrr… the crrrrate hrrr… But the key! Hrrr wherrre's the key?! Hrrr…
    499662|00000000||Hrrr why so silent, Rramund… you thief hrr… you rrrrrogue hrrr… you hrr hrrr whoreson… hrr worthless bastard! Hrrr…

    580019|05b6c5a4||Drunk
    562678|87e5ea9d||Warrior
   1032757|00000000||I asked for fresh fish. What's this?
   1032759|00000000||Fresh fish.
   1032761|00000000||You call this fresh? With its googly eyes? And those gills? It reeks of Novigrad gutters!
   1032763|00000000||Fishermen fear the deep seas with Skellige savages venturing further and further from their poxy isles.
   1032765|00000000||And the Black Ones're always eager for any fresh catch they happen upon.
    515264|00000000||Look to me like a fierce-fisted fighter. Just right for our tournament. It's your chance to slap around some yokels, win some coin for the pleasure. You in?
    515280|00000000||I'm ready to fight.
    515281|00000000||One and all, hear this! Betting on the next brawl will begin in mere moments!
    515282|00000000||The witcher'll face Smithy, who'll pound his gob like he pounds hot iron ingots!
   1075455|00000000||Let's do this.
    540489|00000000||The witcher versus Smithy! At it, boys!
    515266|00000000||I'm ready to fight.
    515275|00000000||Sorry. Not in the mood.
    515268|00000000||So long.
    540109|00000000||Heheheheh. Couldn't stay away, could you?
    478312|dbb86633||Bandit
    506843|00000000||And never come back, ye stinkin' scadges!
    506845|00000000||All's we wanted was…
    506847|00000000||Don't give a flyin' fuck what you wanted! Get!
    530613|00000000||Next time I'll rip your fuckin' legs off and shove them up your arse till you've toes for teeth!
   1054558|00000000||Lice eat you, you mangy dwarf!
   1054560|00000000||Let it go, Jaret. Come on, we need another place to hunker down the night.
   1054562|00000000||Maybe we oughta try the King of Beggars?
   1055799|00000000||What the--? Look at me. I look like a ploughin' beggar to you? I'm a citizen temporarily short of a permanent dwellin', naught else.
   1055802|00000000||Wanna go on lookin', be my guest. I'm goin' to see the king.
    570301|00000000||Aaaarrrggggh!!!
    570303|00000000||An eye for an eye.
    570307|00000000||Th-they're coming…
    570310|00000000||Dudu, listen. This is what we'll do…
    570313|00000000||Arrrrgh… Get that fuckin' whore!
    509099|00000000||Why?
    509304|00000000||Why's he averse to having an apprentice?
    509306|00000000||How should I know… Perhaps because he's a stubborn, mean ass?
    509301|00000000||Maybe he'll make an exception, share them with me?
    509303|00000000||As likely as mistletoe sprouting from right here.
    509098|00000000||Think he might share them with me?
    473159|00000000||Kind old geezer I just saw you talking to - who was he?
    473161|00000000||One of our circle. Gremist. An exceptional alchemist… but a stubborn, mean ass.
    473163|00000000||Well, been around sorceresses my share. Long enough to know that with great enlightenment comes even greater arrogance.
    473165|00000000||But sorceresses welcome apprentices, am I right? Not Gremist. So many formulae in that head, so many methods of ingesting and absorbing lethal toxins… But he'd rather take them to the grave than share!
    473123|00000000||Druid you were talking to - who was he?
    509082|00000000||Farewell.
    473127|00000000||Farewell.
    473121|00000000||Yes? What do you seek?
   1050491|7ef171cd||Hound of the Wild Hunt
    508640|00000000||Wounds around the neck and shoulders.
    508641|00000000||Claw marks… Long and sharp.
    508642|00000000||A lesser vampire.
    573617|00000000||Stay close to me.
    509060|00000000||Lantern's still lit… died recently. From bites to the neck.
    508639|00000000||Body's pale, dried out.
   1017561|00000000||Remember when the Black'uns overtook us on the highroad?
   1017563|00000000||Mhh. Good thing we had the means to buy our freedom…
   1017565|00000000||And you'd not wanted to take Idgit Irene along. Said she weren't no use to us.
   1017567|00000000||Hm, might could pray for her soul…
   1077342|d64c4bc1||Innkeep
    493303|00000000||You told him you're a sorceress?
    493310|00000000||Triss, you told this man you're a sorceress?
    493312|00000000||Of course. She was looking for work - that's her chief asset.
    493314|00000000||Are you Triss?
    499806|00000000||I know it was reckless, but competition's stiff here. No one would hire me if I claimed to be a common rat catcher.
    493316|00000000||More importantly no one would believe such a beauty could be an exterminator of rodents.
    499808|00000000||You'll pay - in advance.
    501431|00000000||Don't much like merchants who flatter with cheap praise before the job's done.
    501433|00000000||That was not cheap praise! I was merely stating a fact.
    501435|00000000||So am I.
    499829|00000000||I want you to pay in full in advance.
    499831|00000000||I'm afraid that's impossible.
    499833|00000000||Then trap your own rats.
    499835|00000000||Well, now I know why she brought you along. Fine. A full purse of Novigrad crowns. As proof of my good will.
    499809|00000000||Half in advance.
    499837|00000000||You're a merchant, familiar with how commerce works.
    499839|00000000||Of course. Honest pay for honest work.
    499841|00000000||Half up front, half once the job's done.
    499843|00000000||You're asking a great deal.
    499845|00000000||I'm a witcher. Gotta admit I've met my share of people who say one thing beforehand, another after the fact.
    499847|00000000||Hm, very well. Your first installment.
    497358|00000000||We need to place these crystals around the granary. Near anything that looks rat-related.
    501439|00000000||All right, then… Let's get to work.
    499807|00000000||Let's get to work.
    499819|00000000||Triss, you and Brandon here - you've agreed a price?
    499821|00000000||We settled on a full coin purse.
    499823|00000000||Brandon and Co. is a serious outfit. We've the largest granary in all Novigrad.
    501437|00000000||But I'd prefer you not to tarry and begin.
    493306|00000000||Is that a problem?
    493308|00000000||By the Eternal Fire, no! I'm surprised, that's all.
    501393|00000000||Together I expect you'll resolve things twice as fast. You've the look of true experts.
    493302|00000000||Problem?
    493297|00000000||Greetings, sorceress.
    493299|00000000||Greetings, Brandon.
    493301|00000000||I didn't expect you to bring company.
    535722|00000000||The Tuirseach clan, we're kings among the clans…
    535723|00000000||Wouldn't mind a donut.
   1008332|00000000||Krakens, my arse.
   1008334|00000000||Ye pack a powerful ploughin' punch, Geralt, I'll give ye that.
   1087749|50c0ce6b||Cannibal Chief
   1041607|00000000||The exchange - we should do it right quick.
   1041976|00000000||Afraid your client might change his mind?
   1041978|00000000||No, I'm more likely to.
   1043993|00000000||Had so many buyers for these cards, I felt like the belle of the ball.
   1055182|495926ed||Aristocrat
    478105|00000000||I'll try.
    478109|00000000||I'll try.
    478110|00000000||In that case, I shall be waiting.
    478113|00000000||See you, Keira.
    478107|00000000||I'll stop by. You can be sure.
    478104|00000000||Be sure to stop by.
    478097|00000000||Do you intend to venture into Crookback Bog? You must tell me about it afterwards.
    478099|00000000||Don't know that I'll get the chance.
    478101|00000000||Geralt, there are two types of men: those who see opportunity and take advantage, and those who forge the opportunities themselves.
    478103|00000000||I've always seen you as an example of the latter. Besides, I've a favor to ask you. So, visit me some time?
    477974|00000000||Whew, at last. But it was worth it, right? You learned something about Ciri in the end, something important.
    512767|00000000||My contact should be there.
    512766|00000000||The man we're due to meet is probably waiting already.
    512770|00000000||Come on.
   1069045|00000000||Let's go.
   1069046|00000000||Who's this contact?
   1069048|00000000||Your contact - who is it?
   1069050|00000000||Slippery little bugger. I'd have nothing to do with him were the circumstances any different.
   1069052|00000000||Mean you don't trust him?
   1069054|00000000||I trust no one. Including you.
    512768|00000000||Ready?
    512769|00000000||Contact awaits at the chess club. Let's get this over with.
    512771|00000000||Something's not right.
    512772|00000000||Let's see what.
    424285|00000000||Be glad to glance at what you're selling.
    424279|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    424297|00000000||Va fail.
    424283|00000000||Farewell.
    424281|00000000||You know who I am?
    424287|00000000||You know me? Where from?
    424289|00000000||We met long ago, in Brokilon.
    424291|00000000||Possible, but can't say I remember.
    424293|00000000||No surprise - you were badly wounded then. If not for the dryads' care, it's unlikely you would have survived.
    424295|00000000||Long time ago… So long it feels like it happened in another life. Maybe that's not so far from the truth…
   1077479|00000000||It's you! I'll never forget you. I must thank you once more!
    424277|00000000||Greetings, Gwynbleidd. Would you like to trade?
    489441|00000000||I must climb onto the roof.
    489445|00000000||Room on the top floor. One with the balcony.
    490013|00000000||There's the balcony. Let's see what's inside.
   1077539|00000000||[Short hair and pony tail.]
   1077541|00000000||[Long hair let down.]
   1077542|00000000||[Just a shave.]
    421351|00000000||So long.
   1077543|00000000||Farewell.
   1077540|00000000||[Shaved head and ponytail.]
   1077486|00000000||Me savior! Greetin's to ye! So, in for a shear?
    577784|00000000||Get a haircut from you?
    358206|00000000||Thank ye, sir! Saved our hides, ye did!
    409297|00000000||Here, take it - your pay, and the share o' the whoreson who forced us to dig up the dead. Godspeed, now.
    581234|00000000||Let's collect our reward.
   1004305|00000000||So?
   1003390|00000000||What do you think? We did what we had to do. Time to pay up.
   1003391|00000000||Wait here. I'll go see the supervisor, get your reward.
   1003392|00000000||Do that ourselves. No reason you should abandon your post.
   1073972|00000000||Hm…
   1003393|00000000||Can't argue with reason. Go on in.
   1072298|00000000||Bloody pirates! Not a moment's peace from 'em!
    443249|00000000||I've come to talk.
    443255|00000000||Hello, Junior. I've come to talk.
    443257|00000000||I'll do whatever you want…
    489982|00000000||We'd made a deal. I was to repair their magic phyla-whatsit. The… girl and the songster were to bring me Sigi Reuven's treasure. They didn't, so I might've flown off the handle a bit, I admit…
    489984|00000000||What did you do?
    489986|00000000||I nabbed their flunky, Dodo, and waited for them to come for him.
    489380|00000000||Look… this. Here's what they wanted fixed.
    489992|00000000||A phylactery? You can fix something like this?
    489994|00000000||Not me. I know a guy…
    489997|00000000||Wasting my time, Junior. I need details.
    489382|00000000||I'll tell you, tell you all! Just the way it happened…
    443318|00000000||I'd like to know how the ashen-haired woman ended up meeting you, and what happened to her.
    443320|00000000||What happened to her? She attacked me!
    443322|00000000||Lie one more time, and I'll cut your balls off.
    443324|00000000||Heheheh…
    443286|00000000||Tell me about her.
    443288|00000000||Lemme tell you why you shouldn't lie.
    443326|00000000||Pay attention now. You'll tell the truth. Wanna know why?
    443328|00000000||I won't lie, honest!
    459133|00000000||Took me a long time to find you. Wasn't an easy road to travel. I'm angry and tired.
    459135|00000000||Had to talk to people I didn't wanna talk to, wouldn't normally talk to.
    459137|00000000||Had to kill a lot of people along the way.
    459139|00000000||Some of them tried to cheat me, some tried to lie. I didn't like it one bit.
    459141|00000000||I feel like one more lie'd be the last bitter drop in a chalice full of sorrow. And then… then I'd do something I would later regret.
    459143|00000000||Now you know why you can't lie to me?
    459145|00000000||Yes…
    459147|00000000||Good.
    443260|00000000||Got a few questions to start with.
    443262|00000000||I'll tell you everything…
    443264|00000000||I'm looking for a young woman and a minstrel. I know you've met them.
    443266|00000000||A bird? What fucking b--?
    443269|00000000||Ashen-haired with a sword on her back. Just like me.
    443284|00000000||Yes, yes… Her, that was… I remember…
    443251|00000000||Hello, Junior. Been looking for you a while now.
    458755|00000000||I've come to kill you.
    443253|00000000||I'll give you all I got…
    443247|00000000||I'm here to kill you.
    443227|00000000||What the sandwich fuck is this?
    443230|00000000||Oh fuck me…
    443233|00000000||Help me, for fuck's sake!
    443235|00000000||No one's coming.
    443237|00000000||Ooomph…
    443242|00000000||Stop…
    443245|00000000||What… What do you want?
   1053241|00000000||Terribly dear, these tariffs…
   1053243|00000000||King sets 'em, not me.
   1053245|00000000||But you decide who passes, not Radovid. Perhaps we might reach an understanding, eh?
   1053247|00000000||We could talk it over, I suppose… but all adry like this?
   1053249|00000000||Never. Ilke! Bring the corporal a cup.
   1053251|00000000||Corporal…? No. I'm but a lowly private.
   1053253|00000000||One up for promotion, clearly! Why, you've an officer's manner, and a wise head to go with it!
    532415|a36dcc16||Rich Townsman
   1053328|00000000||Whatcha need, mate?
   1053330|00000000||Herbs - to rid me mouth of a horrible stench.
   1053332|00000000||Oh, aye… you could use 'em.
   1055016|00000000||And remember - never venture into the Bits alone. Always take a partner.
   1055018|00000000||Rubbish.
   1055020|00000000||Got a wife?
   1055022|00000000||No.
   1055024|00000000||How about a dog?
   1055026|00000000||Yeah, I've a dog.
   1055028|00000000||So you've got someone to live for.
    489561|00000000||Where's Reuven's treasure?!
    489559|00000000||I'll gut you, you little whore!
   1007878|00000000||So if it weren't lightnin', then what? Who'd dare to burn the baron's stable down?
   1007880|00000000||Heard the baron lost it, blood rushed to his head and--
   1007882|00000000||Be a rush of blood here if we don't finish by sundown.
   1007884|00000000||Roof won't lay itself on the stable, you prick whittlers.
    374693|00000000||Pour me another, love.
    374932|00000000||You've 'ad enough.
    374934|00000000||No wench'll ration my vodka! Pour, dammit! 'Fore ye taste the back of me hand.
    374936|00000000||Whadda ye want?
    397377|00000000||Who rules this land now?
    397379|00000000||Baron does.
    397381|00000000||By whose decree - Temerian or Nilfgaardian?
    397383|00000000||Uh, by his own. War's on - you got the men, you take the land.
    397385|00000000||Why're you so curious? Eh?
    397375|00000000||What can you tell me about this region?
    374967|00000000||So long.
    374971|00000000||High time we went home.
    408076|00000000||We'll go once I've drunk.
    374942|00000000||Farewell.
    374938|00000000||You Hendrik?
    374951|00000000||You Hendrik?
    374953|00000000||No…
    374955|00000000||Don't natter with that 'un. It'll bring trouble.
    374963|00000000||Got some questions.
    374965|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1030902|00000000||Sukrus, wait!
   1030916|00000000||Slow down, Sukrus. Let's talk.
   1030917|00000000||I've gotta save me brother-in-law. Attack!
   1030914|00000000||Give 'em here, Sukrus!
   1030915|00000000||Tuirseach!
   1030901|00000000||Let's dance!
   1030900|00000000||Have you any idea whose warehouse this is, goatfucker?!
   1030911|00000000||Oi, Geralt. It's the bloke Hattori told us about. The bugger who sleeps with Cleaver, or somethin'.
   1030912|00000000||Sukrus, why are you here…? With the sorcerer? Oh, now I see. That is one hell of a jest you've pulled!
   1030913|00000000||Hattori sent you? That ploughing nonhuman'll be sorry his mother didn't strangle him with his navel string. But first we'll feed you to the crabs.
   1033178|00000000||Hands off my brother-in-law, swine. Only I can thrash him, understood?
   1043693|00000000||Brother, let's mop the floor with these ploughin' Nordlings. Join us, Geralt! At 'em!
   1052632|00000000||Buy today, for I'll be gone tomorrow.
   1052634|00000000||Are you leaving? Might I know where to?
   1052636|00000000||To Kovir, no doubt. Things're peaceful there.
   1052638|00000000||No. I've received a summons. I'm to present myself at the barracks of the Temple Guard. Not many return from there.
   1052640|00000000||Will you go?
   1052642|00000000||Do I have a choice?
    551559|00000000||Prints… Too small to be a man's, too large for a child.
    552166|00000000||Stride indicates she was running… probably why she tore her dress.
   1032379|00000000||Somebody chase her?
    551563|00000000||Avoids confrontation… Gotta learn more about her, no hope of defeating her otherwise.
    551571|00000000||Couldn't outrun her pursuer. He stabbed her or slit her throat. Strange - left the knife behind.
    552170|00000000||Dried blood on it. Could come in handy.
    551572|00000000||Dragged the body through here. Clear trail…
    551594|00000000||No way I can hope to lift this curse.
    552175|00000000||Gotta drive the wraith away. Stand a chance if I can bind it to one spot for a while.
    551600|00000000||A nightwraith won't appear in daylight.
    551618|00000000||A scorned lover killed the woman, seems to me.
    551581|00000000||Lugged the body all the way to the woods, buried it here. Shallow grave - murderer must've been pressed for time.
    551669|00000000||Something's sticking out… A letter?
    568864|00000000||Still need some mistletoe…
   1019077|00000000||Ealdorman probably knew the girl. I oughta ask him.
   1019076|00000000||They gotta know about the wraith in the village. I'll have to ask…
   1019137|00000000||A nightwraith…
    551558|00000000||A piece of fabric… possibly from a dress. Got snagged on the undergrowth.
    529542|00000000||Oy! You! Dandy boy! Picked a bad time to stroll this borough, mate.
    531493|00000000||Are any of you gentlemen familiar with Pup, an individual in the employ of a certain Cleaver Varese?
    531496|00000000||Enough bunk. Purse or perish, mate.
   1032711|00000000||Don't understand why them Redanians won't let folk cross the Pontar.
   1032713|00000000||Aye, it's as if they don't know there's death and the Black Ones on the other side.
   1032715|00000000||Radovid never gave a hoot 'bout the common man. They don't call him the Stern for naught.
   1032717|00000000||King's got other things on his mind beside refugees. And at the river, it was soldiers pressed into service looking for bribes, that's all.
    475209|00000000||Run!
    475207|00000000||People! Castle's on fire!
    398704|00000000||What'd this man do to you?
    400293|00000000||Him? Nothin'. Appeared in the village… Lookin' to trade his ring for some bread.
    458739|00000000||But we've no food, none. 'Cause of the Black Ones - trampled our fields, raided our granaries, burned our orchards. So instead of bread, he'll get a noose.
   1034289|00000000||Please, good folk. Do you not have ears?! I did not want this war! I have deserted, to go home to my wife and child! Take everything I have, but spare my life!
    458753|00000000||Tried it the nice way… Gotta try something different.
    458749|00000000||Tried asking nicely…
    398706|00000000||So long.
    398716|00000000||Do what you want.
    458747|00000000||Oh, we will… Don't you fret.
    458751|00000000||Do what you want.
    398714|00000000||Let him go.
    458743|00000000||Oh, sure, and maybe give 'im some fixin's for the journey? Saddle up a horse for 'im?
    458745|00000000||Black Ones showed us no mercy. We show them none in return.
    398272|00000000||Release him.
    398236|00000000||Still torturing him?
    400295|00000000||No worries, he'll hang soon.
    455609|00000000||Thank you… If not for you, that would've been the end of us. Sure as spring!
    401037|00000000||Where'd you learn to twirl a sword like that?
    401039|00000000||Someplace far away.
    408674|00000000||You know I can't let it lie.
    408676|00000000||Don't think I care.
    382111|00000000||Oi, where the fuck are you going?!
    344448|00000000||Guard called you a sergeant. You a Temerian soldier?
    380446|00000000||Not your concern, mate.
    344450|00000000||Deserter?
    345317|00000000||Temerian army don't exist no more.
    380456|00000000||So what're you all doing here?
    345319|00000000||Had a choice after the Black Ones thrashed us - let it lie and try to lead normal lives…
    380458|00000000||…or continue to resist, join the guerillas and fight for our beloved Temeria till death do us part.
    408806|00000000||We chose the former.
    380461|00000000||And the baron your commander?
    380463|00000000||Hmm, yeah - commander…
    172223|069383d6||Doorman
    550014|00000000||Didn't even have time to pull out his weapon. Monster must've been concealed, surprised him.
    550015|00000000||Different claw marks… Guess a few individuals feed here.
    550016|00000000||Strange… no tracks around the corpses.
    550017|00000000||Ugh, bastards are strong. Must be the fog.
    550018|00000000||No ordinary fog, this. The odor… metallic almost.
    550019|00000000||Corpse has decomposed almost completely.
    550020|00000000||Guess I'm dealing with an old foglet… hiding behind an illusion.
    549975|00000000||Tracks masked with magic. This is getting interesting.
    466109|00000000||Leave them alone.
    466111|00000000||What's it to you?
    499237|00000000||Won't stand by and watch you rob and murder them. Plain refuse to.
    466115|00000000||Got a sensitive one. Look away, woman.
    499239|00000000||Still here?
    499244|00000000||Oy! Get him!
    499224|00000000||Leave 'em alone.
    466127|00000000||Fair enough. Not my business.
    466129|00000000||Now fuck off and leave us to ours.
    466131|00000000||Shoulda talked when I asked nicely, but nooo… We'll ploughin' find the coin ourselves, you stupid hick.
    499225|00000000||None of my business.
    466097|00000000||Where's your gold? You can tell us willingly or…
    466099|00000000||No! Please… We've none left!
    499217|00000000||Sir, help us!
    466101|00000000||Stay out of this.
   1049415|e2360922||Count de Luverten
   1068065|00000000||Greetings to the honorable gentleman. Welcome, make yourself at home. What have you come for? We're prepared to fulfill your every whim.
   1068067|00000000||We're honored to have the esteemed gentleman pay us another visit, come back for more, as it were. What would you like?
   1068069|00000000||I like you, like how you look, like how you smell…
   1071688|00000000||If that's so, let's discuss what might happen next.
   1068060|00000000||Let's go.
   1068073|00000000||Nice meeting you.
   1068062|00000000||Take care.
   1068061|00000000||Let's talk.
   1068071|00000000||The Passiflora certainly deserves its reputation.
   1071690|00000000||We do all to please our patrons and make sure to turn the rabble away.
   1068604|00000000||Pleasure to see you again.
   1071692|00000000||Likewise.
   1071694|00000000||Any special wishes?
    572496|00000000||Need to talk to Patricia Vegelbud.
    572498|00000000||You think any bum off the street can--?
    448206|00000000||Her life's in danger. Let me in, or have her blood on your hands.
   1069069|00000000||If you've thought this up, and I let you in, they'll throw my arse out the door.
   1069071|00000000||Always thought a guard was supposed to protect his charge, not his ass.
   1069074|00000000||So be it… I'll take you to Lady Vegelbud. Just no trickery, understand?
   1013171|00000000||Need to talk to Patricia Vegelbud.
   1013176|00000000||Nothing. Farewell.
   1013172|00000000||Nothing. So long.
   1013174|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    435058|00000000||Bad idea.
    435080|00000000||If the hunters are after Albert, I doubt some merrymaking will distract them.
    435086|00000000||Geralt, a ball at the Vegelbuds' is hardly some merrymaking…
    429397|00000000||Expecting any trouble?
    429470|00000000||Expect any trouble during the ball?
    429472|00000000||Hardest part'll be to keep Master Albert's departure a secret from his grandmother.
    429568|00000000||Is that necessary?
   1004068|00000000||Lady Patricia's a fervent believer of the Eternal Fire. Knows naught about Albert's interests in alchemy.
   1004070|00000000||Luckily the elder Lady Vegelbud's a rare visitor to the country residence.
   1004060|00000000||Truly an atypical family…
   1004062|00000000||I'm not one to judge, sir.
    429395|00000000||I'm going with Triss.
    589496|00000000||Need to get something else done first.
    589530|00000000||Something I need to do first.
    589532|00000000||Fine, buy our masks while you're at it. And you should change - ball attire.
   1003657|00000000||No. Where is it?
   1003659|00000000||Nonhumans' shanty town. You should find it easily.
    508475|00000000||Just masks, right? Probably don't need to wear a… doublet, do I?
    508534|00000000||A doublet, Geralt. And it's not up for discussion.
    589562|00000000||Take care of that, then come see me.
   1003634|00000000||Been there before. Elihal's a friend of Dandelion's.
    589534|00000000||I bet you can get everything we need for the ball at Elihal's shop. You know it?
    589498|00000000||Think we can head there now?
    589528|00000000||You're kidding, right? We have to prepare, change clothes… most importantly, buy our masks.
    589495|00000000||Can we head there now?
    429763|00000000||Hope we won't have to stay till the end.
    429821|00000000||You're coming with me?
    435094|00000000||Course I am. Not about to send you into what could prove to be the lion's den by yourself.
    435096|00000000||Think about it - eighty-five desserts. While you're still trying to keep your waist at twenty-two inches…
    435098|00000000||Geralt, please… How do we get to the residence?
    429767|00000000||Your invitation - take it. Guard at the gate'll have instructions for you.
   1000283|00000000||You're to wear a fox mask, all right? Good luck to you.
   1005623|00000000||Expecting any trouble?
   1005624|00000000||Is Ingrid done mourning her mother?
   1004026|00000000||Has Ingrid recovered from her mother's death?
   1004028|00000000||How d'you know 'bout that…?
   1004030|00000000||Took an interest in the matter.
   1004031|00000000||Well… Lady Ingrid don't allow herself to demonstrate any weakness. At least not in front of the help.
   1004033|00000000||Master Albert's safety - it's what matters to her now.
    435088|00000000||Word is at the last one they served a hundred different desserts, and the fireworks boomed from dusk till dawn.
    435090|00000000||What with the war and all, m'lady's ordained but eighty-five desserts this time.
    435092|00000000||Won't be no candied petals of blue roses from Nazair. The roses've become dreadfully hard to come by.
    435100|00000000||Oh, I'd love to see it all…
    435060|00000000||It's a good idea. A boisterous bash, that'll distract the hunters.
    435062|00000000||Especially if even half of what I've heard about the Vegelbuds' balls is true.
    435056|00000000||Good idea.
    424837|00000000||Seems Albert needs to disappear - soon as possible.
    424841|00000000||I can arrange that. Think young Vegelbud can slip out of the house unnoticed?
    424843|00000000||Tain't that simple, sadly. Master Albert's in hiding - at the Vegelbuds' country estate.
    435036|00000000||Lady Ingrid's got the notion she can get 'im out quietly - wants to throw a lavish masquerade ball.
    435018|00000000||Am I supposed to attend, help him escape?
    424859|00000000||Aye, we'll not manage without you, miss. Lady Vegelbud fears the help's bein' watched.
    424821|00000000||Seems high time for Albert to disappear.
    424823|00000000||How'd you find Triss?
    429303|00000000||How'd Ingrid Vegelbud know to contact Triss? That Triss was the right person?
    429272|00000000||We learned Miss Merigold had helped Myra Baiss disappear once the witch hunters were onto her.
    508621|00000000||Myra provided Lady Ingrid with magical assistance on a few occasions, with m'lady's… ahem… afflictions.
    433261|00000000||Makes sense. Myra mentioned treating a high-born lady to me once.
    429040|00000000||So what's this about? Be straight.
    429042|00000000||Lady Vegelbud's son - he's the... problem. Master Albert's taken an interest in alchemy… Temple Guard's gotten wind…
    429044|00000000||Wouldn't worry about the Guard, but since the mage hunters tried to grab you, I'd say Albert's in serious trouble.
    429046|00000000||Aye. Lady Vegelbud bought off the guardsmen, but since the hunters pay for every mage revealed to 'em…
   1000172|00000000||Guardsmen took a bribe from the frightened family, then whispered a word to the hunters anyway…
    429036|00000000||What's this about.
    429038|00000000||Who are you, exactly?
   1000160|00000000||Now that we're past the initial courtesies, maybe you can tell us who you are.
   1000162|00000000||Lady Vegelbud's valet. I… I meant you no offense, sir.
    429073|00000000||Why wouldn't Lady Vegelbud meet with me personally?
    429075|00000000||She was afraid they'd follow her. Been a nervous wreck of late.
    587179|00000000||You were to come alone, miss!
    587181|00000000||If not for him, that trio would've dragged you in for questioning. The tall one was Valdo Muris, works for the witch hunters.
    587183|00000000||Aye, you're surely right, miss. I… it just weren't what I expected, since Lady Vegelbud…
   1000127|00000000||What'd they want from you?
   1000140|00000000||I've no clue! First time I've laid eyes on 'em. Maybe… well, recently someone's been tryin' to question our messengers... 'bout the young count.
   1000141|00000000||Hold on. Where's Miss Merigold?
   1010112|00000000||This weather is really dispiriting.
   1010106|00000000||Ahem.
   1010108|00000000||Ah, welcome.
   1010104|00000000||Hmmm.
    390402|0001a55a||Townsman
   1025908|00000000||Come by the Chameleon! Grand openin' tonight!
   1025909|00000000||Crownin' the evenin' - a performance by the illustrious duo… Master Dandelion and Priscilla!
    175773|00000000||If I didn't know him better, I'd say he was jealous about this Marabella.
    181756|00000000||Argh, doubt it. Former pupil, and, well, the tales he told me 'bout her…
    181760|00000000||Doubt I want to hear them…
    418594|00000000||Probably better off not. Things 'tween them took a turn for the strange at some point…
    500701|00000000||Meaning?
    418596|00000000||She had him wearin' mummer's costumes, took to callin' him Christian, referrin' to herself as Anastasia…
    418660|00000000||Hm, truly perverse…
    418662|00000000||Ye dinnae ken the half of it! Called 'im her stallion, once - 'course the fool took it as a compliment... till she pulled a bit and reins outta her cupboard. Ho ho! Poor bastard fled out the window.
    175707|00000000||Marabella.
    181702|00000000||Vespula... Name rings a bell... She threw his knickers out the window?
    418769|00000000||That's her.
    418771|00000000||Hollered something about him being a scoundrel with a voice like a consumptive pheasant?
    418773|00000000||That's her.
    418775|00000000||Threw flower pots at him?
    181704|00000000||Guess old flames never die.
    175709|00000000||Vespula.
    500702|00000000||Her da's a Nilfgaardian aristocrat with the imperial legation. Commissioned Dandelion to tutor Rosa and her sister in the art of rhetoric, but wee Rosa preferred swordplay.
    181688|00000000||How dare she reject the great bard in favor of a common swordmaster?
    418796|00000000||More than one, it seems. Week on week we get fresh gossip 'bout her thrashin' another instructor. So bad he resigns.
    437320|00000000||Word has it her da's now looking to hire her next victim, I mean, instructor.
   1055860|00000000||All right. But var Attre? Her dad happen to be the Nilfgaardian ambassador?
   1055862|00000000||He is. You know 'im?
   1055864|00000000||Wouldn't say that. Had a brief conversation with him at the palace in Vizima.
   1055866|00000000||Well, then you've a good notion of the kind of bloke he is. Commissioned Dandelion to tutor Rosa and her sister in the art of rhetoric, but wee Rosa preferred swordplay.
    175727|00000000||Like a rose abashed of its crimson hue, fair Rosa would sink into humors blue. She shunned her lessons in civility to swing her Dwarf with agility.
    181670|00000000||Dwarf? Never suspected he'd be so humble.
    181672|00000000||Heheh, Dwarf's what Rosa var Attre named her gwyhyr. Well chosen, eh?
    175711|00000000||Rosa var Attre.
    175765|00000000||A figure most rare, her nature dual. Look deep in her eyes, or be made a fool.
    354881|00000000||Well, well… Seems fascinated with this one…
    354883|00000000||Errr, not without reason… Never been much for elven women meself, but this one's exceptional. Dare say Francesca Findabair'd be jealous.
    418800|00000000||You wanna take this one, then?
    430649|00000000||Nah, you can have her.
    430651|00000000||Why?
    418802|00000000||You see… elven beauty's like a young Beauclair wine. Whereas I prefer vodka straight up.
    175713|00000000||Elihal.
    175783|00000000||Well, know about all I wanted to know. Thanks for your help.
    175717|00000000||Know all I wanted to know.
    175705|00000000||Molly.
    175761|00000000||Though well she knows the touch of silk and lace, she shuns not straw when gripped in lust’s embrace.
    175763|00000000||Molly. Keeps things tidy for the Baroness la Valette.
    181712|00000000||A baroness within reach, and he settled for a chambermaid?
    181716|00000000||Dandelion's not one to judge folk by their station - you know that. Like he says, "In the alcove, we're all equals."
    418588|00000000||Yeah, guess a true poet observes life in all its aspects, examines it from all perspectives…
    492252|00000000||Still here? Looking for something?
    492253|00000000||Ah, just checking to see that everythin's in place. Buggers mighta hauled somethin' off for pawnin'…
    500678|00000000||Actually, glad you're still here. Wanted to ask you about someone.
   1054676|00000000||Had another question about the planner.
   1054680|00000000||Aye, aye, I'm all ears.
   1054625|00000000||Well, don't just stand there. Read - we might learn somethin'.
    381170|00000000||Try not to make a mess.
    384006|00000000||For their return, I want everything to be as they left it.
   1058000|00000000||Our bedchamber. Tamara's room is there.
    594474|00000000||*Merry whistling*
    594476|00000000||Reeks here. Time I went back to sea.
    594478|00000000||Ah. Yaaaawn…
    453044|00000000||Claw marks - wolves. I should look around.
    589791|00000000||It's the truth.
    589797|00000000||Tellin' you the truth. Awfully prone to suspicion, you hunters…
    589799|00000000||Not without reason…
    589784|00000000||Yeah, a megascope crystal.
    589809|00000000||Dust, dirt… and a megascope crystal.
    589811|00000000||Whatever the hell that is… But… good chance it's important. Hand it here. We'll see the king gets it.
    589785|00000000||None of your business.
    589822|00000000||Not your concern.
    589824|00000000||Wrong there, friend. I serve the king. Everything that concerns him's my concern as well.
   1001553|00000000||Hand it over, whatever you found. We'll see the king gets it.
   1001076|00000000||So be it… But to the king directly. Straight into his hands.
   1001077|00000000||You can be sure o' that…
   1001557|00000000||Let's go!
   1001054|00000000||Fine.
   1001053|00000000||Not gonna happen.
   1001050|00000000||Forgetting yourself. Save your orders for your men.
   1001052|00000000||As you wish…
    589801|00000000||Grab him!
    589793|00000000||Dunno. Your problem, I guess.
    589794|00000000||Oh, you're wrong there…
    589790|00000000||Your problem.
    589787|00000000||Cremated notes, a nekker nest, rats… Nothing interesting.
    589789|00000000||Why don't I believe you?
    589783|00000000||Not a thing.
    589777|00000000||You're alive…?
    589778|00000000||Find anything?
   1001023|00000000||And then he opened the portal and pranced through.
   1001024|00000000||You shoulda gone after him!
   1001549|00000000||Straight into some monster's jaws? Preferred to come up, inform you. Besides, he'll come back this way, he's gotta.
   1001551|00000000||Oh, there he is now.
    467862|00000000||Master witcher… Do you always help folk for free?
    467864|00000000||Sometimes for free… Usually for pay.
    467866|00000000||Phew… I was afraid you were… abnormal.
    572168|00000000||Wha?
    572170|00000000||I see it there. I touch it - it's soft. I smell it - it stinks. I bite it - yup, shite!
    572174|00000000||I'd kill for a bite.
    572172|00000000||*Spits* Fuck all this.
    572176|00000000||Your time to die.
   1043573|00000000||Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
   1073263|00000000||Sheathe the sword, mate.
   1073265|00000000||You bored, mate?!
   1073267|00000000||Good of you to behave, mate.
   1073269|00000000||Pth. Come on, then.
   1017796|00000000||Find it?
   1017797|00000000||No.
   1017798|00000000||Duke'll be peeved we didn't get Zed to spill where he keeps the ledger.
   1017799|00000000||I tried, didn't I?
   1017800|00000000||Mighta pressed 'im too hard. Shit. Well, least we got the Isengrim card.
   1017801|00000000||Greetings.
   1017802|00000000||Oh, fuck. C'mon, Ringo, time to shine. Get 'im!
   1044794|00000000||Without that sword from Madame Irina my plan's as doomed as devil piss. Will you get it for me?
   1044414|00000000||Why a cabaret?
   1024360|00000000||Where'd you get this cabaret idea?
   1029051|00000000||It's been a dream for years. Ever since we went to see one in Oxenfurt. Remember? The dancer hanging from the chandelier? And once she was completely downside up, she called you over and--
   1029053|00000000||I remember.
   1024364|00000000||How could you forget?! And this place'll be even better, I promise.
   1044418|00000000||That is, of course, if I can scrounge together the funds for some remodeling.
   1010360|00000000||What was that about?
   1010361|00000000||She spat in my face, or might as well have. Called me a "whoremonger and a witless hack." Can you imagine? Wit is my forte!
   1022663|00000000||Gotta say, Priscilla's really growing on me…
   1044384|00000000||Save it.
   1044386|00000000||And why don't you save your pouting? Prove to her she's wrong.
   1044388|00000000||Exactly what I plan to do. I've always dreamed of having my own cabaret. A bit of paint and plaster and this place will do splendidly.
   1044390|00000000||Just one hitch - I need coin. So… if you happen to get a break between drowners and ekimmu-jigs, maybe you could help an old friend out?
   1024389|00000000||How much d'you need? Maybe I can lend you the coin.
   1024390|00000000||Thank you, Geralt, but I refuse to take a single crown from you. You know what they say - "Fastest way to lose a friend's to loan him some coin."
   1044474|00000000||But a favor - that's different.
   1044476|00000000||What kind of favor?
   1024382|00000000||Can't I just lend you the coin?
   1044451|00000000||Maybe the Vivaldis would give you a loan. I'd vouch for you.
   1044453|00000000||Funny you mention that. I went to see Vivaldi. Know what he said? Witchers are no good as guarantors - risk of premature death is way too high.
   1044478|00000000||But… I have another idea.
   1044449|00000000||Get a loan from the Vivaldis' bank.
   1024367|00000000||What can I do?
   1024377|00000000||How can I help you?
   1024381|00000000||I dated this girl once - Sophronia. That's a name, if you can believe it. Has a merchant for a father, importer of spices from Zerrikania. And daddy dear would never refuse his daughter dear a thing.
   1044518|00000000||We can borrow the coin from her.
   1024733|00000000||Sophronia? Rings a bell.
   1024159|00000000||Name rings a bell… Isn't this the woman you abandoned without saying a word? Stepped out for a bottle of wine, never to return?
   1024161|00000000||Knew I bought that wine for a reason…
   1024162|00000000||A long time ago, that.
   1024198|00000000||Been away a while, sure. Which is why I need… to draw on your authority. You've got some, you know, no matter what you might think.
   1024732|00000000||Where do I come in?
   1029056|00000000||Fine, tell me what you want. Got a feeling you've a plan all cooked up.
   1024903|00000000||Sophronia could still be holding a grudge after our unfortunate… parting. But, with a touch of help from you, I know she'll forgive me. And then give me that loan.
   1024905|00000000||What's this help entail?
   1024907|00000000||First of all, we need to borrow a dull sword from Madame Irina - one of her props. You know, the kind they use during performances?
   1044532|00000000||Get that, then meet me outside Sophronia's house.
   1044533|00000000||And what's your job in all this?
   1044535|00000000||Let's say I agree and go see Madame Irina. What'll you be doing in the meantime?
   1044537|00000000||Something I have to finish. But I promise I'll do it before you come back with the sword. Then I'll tell you the rest.
   1044036|00000000||Do it yourself.
   1001600|00000000||Sorry, Dandelion. Maybe later.
   1001605|00000000||You always say that! If you change your mind, I'll be here.
   1001597|00000000||Don't have time.
   1001596|00000000||Fine.
   1001598|00000000||Fine, but…
   1001599|00000000||Geralt, the only "buts" in this plan'll be the ones filling my seats! It'll work, you'll see!
   1024924|00000000||Get the sword from Madame Irina and meet me outside Sophronia's at sunset!
   1044035|00000000||I'll help you.
   1047639|00000000||Remind me about Sophronia…
   1044046|00000000||What did you want from Sophronia? Slipped my mind…
   1044048|00000000||Geralt, I want to transform this esteemed establishment into a first-class cabaret. And that takes funds. Enter Sophronia.
   1044050|00000000||I remember now. Gotta help you convince her you're trustworthy.
   1044052|00000000||Exactly. And to do that we need a sword from Madame Irina Renarde's prop collection. So, will you help?
   1029086|00000000||Ugh. What's he schemed up this time?
    463160|00000000||Why you been followin' me?
    463164|00000000||Farewell.
    463174|00000000||I'm not. Farewell.
    463166|00000000||Just wondering what you want from him. From Graham.
    463168|00000000||Me? Didn't want nothin'. It's his mother be worried 'bout him…
    463170|00000000||Been locked in his hut since he came back from the isle. Talks to no soul.
    463172|00000000||Love's misery… curdled his brains, I reckon'.
    463162|00000000||What did you want from Graham?
   1028988|00000000||Sail to Skellige? At your age? Now, with a war on? You're daft! Any man'd tell you that!
   1028990|00000000||We'll see. I posted the notice. Just might find a man brave enough. You, go back to your rockin' chair!
    174153|49292af3||Cyclops
    423225|00000000||Looking for some potion ingredients.
    423227|00000000||There's been a mistake… I'm no mage. No, no, no. I'm an apothecary.
    423229|00000000||Mhm. Could swear I saw you at the summit in Loc Muinne.
    423231|00000000||That may have been my twin brother…
    423233|00000000||Stop it. To the Eternal Fire I'm a boil to be lanced, same as you. Relax, not about to turn you in.
    423235|00000000||*Sigh* What do you want?
    423239|00000000||Got anything interesting to sell?
    459608|00000000||I do, but shhh…
    423205|00000000||Got anything to sell?
   1028795|00000000||Wouldn't mind a few rounds of cards.
   1086506|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
    423241|00000000||So long.
    459610|00000000||If anyone asks… You've not seen me.
    423207|00000000||Take care.
    423243|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
    459612|00000000||How'd you end up here? Crematory wouldn't exactly be my first choice if I needed to hide…
    459660|00000000||I wound up here by accident…
    423496|00000000||After the Conclave's deliberations at Loc Muinne.
    459654|00000000||What happened?
    459656|00000000||I moved to condemn Radovid… So Carduin called the guards. They beat me… thoroughly, with gusto.
    459658|00000000||Once they thought I'd expired, they sent me here… The furnace was blazing and open… I felt a wave of heat… and began to scream.
    423492|00000000||At first, after the slaughter at Loc Muinne, I hid in the woods near Ban Glean… But how long can one survive on roots?
    459650|00000000||Finally, I could stand it no more and boarded a raft bound for Novigrad. Once here, my coin soon ran out. I began to beg… and thus met the King of Beggar's men.
    459652|00000000||They gave me a choice. I could start working for him, or they would break my legs.
    423237|00000000||Greetings… what is it?
   1053970|00000000||{Daede sian caente, Aen Seidhe en'allane ael coeden… } [The day will come when the Hill Folk emerge from the woods…]
   1053972|00000000||{Daede caente, en'blathannae gvedilie dinae den dh'oine… } [The day will come when flowers grow midst human cities in ruin…]
   1053974|00000000||{An Hen Dicen sainne en Anfare Morhen an Glaes Mynyde… } [And Elder Speech will ring from the Great Sea to the Blue Mountains…]
   1004316|00000000||What you got growin' here?
   1004317|00000000||Garlic. For the vampeer.
   1004318|00000000||No better protection 'gainst a specter.
   1004319|00000000||Gotta rub yourself in it, good and thorough. Stick it in every hole.
    595097|00000000||Arnout Vester… Nilfgaardian name.
    595099|00000000||From Metinna, I think. But he's hunted and killed everywhere from the far south to the Dragon Mountains.
    595101|00000000||Why have I never heard of him?
    595103|00000000||Goon goes by different names - Brenden Vilfe, Appo Saxon, Manfred Whimplebottoms…
    595105|00000000||Manfred Whimplebottoms? Good name for a clown.
    595107|00000000||Ones he's done in sure weren't laughing.
    595109|00000000||Preferred method - rip the teeth out, one by one, then cut the mouth open ear to ear.
    590896|00000000||It's how they punish deadbeat debtors in the Nilfgaardian underworld.
    590897|00000000||Quite the career. Underworld to serving the emperor and his court.
    590898|00000000||Yeah… Scum does usually float to the top.
   1074246|00000000||Stick closer, Geralt!
   1075830|00000000||Don't have to come with me, you know.
   1075835|00000000||I can handle a few thugs.
   1075836|00000000||I'm here, figured I might as well… Never know, could prove useful.
   1075838|00000000||Besides, kinda wanna see this how this plays out.
    448033|00000000||Dammit. Won't budge.
    448035|00000000||We need another way out. Quick!
    447384|67e07369||Endrega
   1038517|00000000||Belly ripped open, mangled wounds… Claws at work.
    557969|00000000||Knocked over our wagon, then chased us to the cave. We ran like hell, near lost our legs on the way.
    557971|00000000||What do they call ye, master?
    557972|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    557973|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. It'll be a tale to tell the young 'uns…
    557966|00000000||It's huge! What's the name again?
    557967|00000000||Royal wyvern. Don't usually come this big.
    557968|00000000||It's feasted plenty, I reckon. Attackin' those travelin' the road.
    351209|00000000||Good day. Heard you know where to find the local witch.
    351211|00000000||Who told you that?
    354111|00000000||Your wife.
    354113|00000000||Daft wench.
    354115|00000000||Leave me be, and don't listen to that natterin' sow.
    476704|00000000||We've not had a witch, shaman, nor cunnin' wench in ages.
    399784|00000000||Sure? Think about it.
    399794|00000000||You sure? Give it a think.
    399796|00000000||Won't take "no" for an answer, will ye? All right.
    497550|00000000||Thank ye! Was a hair away from givin' up my soul out of fright itself…
    497579|00000000||Point me in the direction of your local witch's hut?
    497580|00000000||...'Twouldn't be right to refuse you after you saved my skin.
    476728|00000000||No need to worry. I'm not out to hurt your witch.
    476946|00000000||Oo, a weight off me heart, sir. She only arrived a short while ago, but she's frightfully wise.
    476948|00000000||Even pleasant on the eyes, if you like 'em skinny.
    476958|00000000||Thanks for your help. Farewell.
    476724|00000000||Don't worry. Won't do your witch any harm.
    476726|00000000||Witch hunters been here?
    476730|00000000||Witch hunters've been here already?
    476732|00000000||Nay, but we've heard tell of 'em.
    476950|00000000||So when I spied ye comin', swords and all, straightaway I thought tales must be true.
    476952|00000000||I'm a witcher. Not a witch hunter.
    482407|00000000||Hmm? What, not one and the same?
    482409|00000000||No.
    497552|00000000||Thanks.
    497554|00000000||It's just... don't harm her, sir. Word of your kind's reached these parts.
    497556|00000000||"My kind" - meaning…?
    497558|00000000||Well, the witch-burnin' kind.
    399798|00000000||Know the small pond near the village? Path leads off from it. Follow that till you come across a lone rock.
    399800|00000000||Walk around that, into the woods. Find the old cart - you're there.
    399788|00000000||Would a few crowns refresh your memory?
    399790|00000000||Oh! Well, if that's how you put it…
    399782|00000000||Would a few crowns change your mind?
    399804|00000000||You're hard at work. Won't interrupt.
    399786|00000000||Farewell.
   1051269|00000000||What do ye want? I told ye I'll say naught about the witch.
    497594|00000000||Heeeelp!
   1071338|b9541080||Farmer's Wife
    572107|00000000||What's new, killer?
    572109|00000000||I'll gut you, scumsucker.
    572113|00000000||Kill, maim, bury.
    572111|00000000||Argh, fuck.
    572115|00000000||Agh, me willy needs a wettin'.
   1073203|00000000||Got somethin' I can pull out, too, and I don't mean my cock.
   1073205|00000000||Shitmug!
   1073207|00000000||You craven?
   1073209|00000000||Brought this on yourself, grayboy.
    456731|00000000||They're safe now, right?
    456733|00000000||Yes. You can stop worrying. Really.
    456736|00000000||Oh, you're right. Just... hard to believe it's over and done with.
    462826|00000000||I've dreamt of this moment for months.
    456749|00000000||Stop risking your life for others - promise me.
    456751|00000000||Promise me one thing - you'll stop risking your life for others.
    456753|00000000||No.
    456755|00000000||No? Triss, not a mage left in Novigrad.
    456759|00000000||But you're here.
    456761|00000000||I can defend myself.
    456763|00000000||Well, from kikimores, griffins, bruxae… but not from the Hunt. You and Ciri'll need my help. And I'll be at your side.
    456747|00000000||This how you imagined this moment would be?
    456765|00000000||This how you imagined things?
    456767|00000000||No. I imagined I'd be on the ship with the rest of them. And you'd be on shore, waving a handkerchief, maybe.
    456769|00000000||I hope you don't regret it… that things have gone differently…
    456771|00000000||Well, they say Kovir's lovely this time of year… But I prefer you.
    456810|00000000||Haha, not surprised. I'm pretty lovely this time of year, too.
    456812|00000000||I won't disagree.
    456816|00000000||We might still go there one day, when it's all over.
    456822|00000000||That would mean balls and banquets and other boring things that start with a "b."
    456824|00000000||Mhm. But also baths, balms, body massages… You could make up for all those years you slept in the bushes and bathed in mountain streams.
    456826|00000000||Sounds tempting. Would I have to give up being a witcher?
    456828|00000000||No. You'd take a monster contract from time to time, to stay sharp… Nothing too dangerous, though, so I wouldn't have to worry. And I'd be waiting for you…
    456830|00000000||Let me guess… with a candlelit dinner.
    456834|00000000||Candles, sure. And a bed.
    456882|00000000||Actually… We've never needed either.
    456820|00000000||Could I still be a witcher in Kovir?
    456818|00000000||Really? Kovir - seems like it's at the world's end.
    456836|00000000||I dunno. Kovir seems so far away, end of the world, really.
    456840|00000000||Hmm. Maybe you're right… So how do you envision our future?
    456842|00000000||I'll be grandmaster of the Order of the Flaming Rose, you'll be High Priestess of Melitele. We'll live happily ever after, a horde of kids around us.
    456886|00000000||Oh no, won't get out of it that easy. I asked you a serious question. Where do you see us in… let's say, five years?
    456921|00000000||This is how I see it. We're living in a small town, where everybody knows everybody else. You've got your practice… brewing potions, that sort of thing.
    456923|00000000||And what're you doing? Running around swamps killing drowners?
    456925|00000000||No. I'm sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, smoking my pipe… listening to the clink of your vials as you work inside.
    456927|00000000||That simple?
    456929|00000000||Mhm. That simple.
    456890|00000000||Life in a small town…
    456931|00000000||Don't know. No idea, honestly.
    456933|00000000||Trying to weasel out of answering again. You rascal.
    456963|00000000||No. It's just, instead of dwelling on the future, I'd rather live in the moment. Like we are now.
    456892|00000000||I don't know. Rather live for the moment.
    456888|00000000||I'd like us to keep moving, stay on the road.
    456898|00000000||I'd like us to keep moving, live on the road, wherever our legs carry us. You know, a month here, a year there…
    456908|00000000||Yes. Forgot you're not the type to settle down.
    456910|00000000||That's true. I don't get attached to places. Just people.
    462968|00000000||I missed this Geralt, you know?
    462970|00000000||Meaning?
    462972|00000000||The Geralt who's not afraid to open up to me. Tell me what he really feels, what he wants.
    462987|00000000||What I want? Hm, one more thing…
    462989|00000000||Shhh. I know.
    570881|00000000||Look! They're signaling us! It's a message!
    570884|00000000||H… l… a… k… b… r…
    570886|00000000||Hl… Hlakbr? It makes no sense.
    570888|00000000||It's code. What did you expect?
    449170|00000000||Thank you, Geralt. For this… and for what you said at the port.
    457040|00000000||I should've said it long ago.
    457050|00000000||So… what happens now? Afraid it's a bit too early for "happily ever after"…
    463304|00000000||The time for that will come.
    463358|00000000||We'll get our happy ending. One day.
    463362|00000000||Yes. Somewhere, over hill and dale…
    463366|00000000||It's a cruel world we live in. It's hard to make plans. Even harder to invest any faith in them, though you might want to… badly.
    463368|00000000||You were in an entirely different mood a moment ago.
    463370|00000000||"Hush. The spark expired."
    463372|00000000||Don't worry about me, Geralt. And please, be careful.
    463302|00000000||I'll go find Ciri.
    463324|00000000||I've gotta find Ciri. I'm close… I will find her, or someone who knows what happened to her.
    463334|00000000||Where will we meet?
    463336|00000000||Can only think of one place where both witchers and sorceresses are welcome.
    463338|00000000||Kaer Morhen.
    463342|00000000||Haven't been there in a while. So, I guess I'll see you, witcher. I'll miss you. A lot.
    463356|00000000||I'll miss you, too.
   1044778|00000000||Akh akh akh…
   1044780|00000000||Rotten bastards oughta let us in…
   1044782|00000000||Gods!
   1044784|00000000||I'm hot, it burns…
   1044786|00000000||Aaaaaah…
    475393|00000000||He's ploughin' been in there an hour already.
    475395|00000000||Must be stranglin' a girthy one.
    475412|00000000||Don't waste yer time.
    475414|00000000||We've all been goin' in the bushes these last days.
    475410|00000000||Uuuuaaaa… Uuuaaa.
   1054771|00000000||I'll cleave you in two, you ploughin' mutant!
   1086145|e5e26ccb||Ice Troll
   1032361|00000000||How much for the night, my peach?
   1032363|00000000||You're mistaken. I'm a dancer, not a whore.
   1032365|00000000||What's this, my peach?! Why here, there have always been--
   1032367|00000000||There have, but things've changed. New management, see. So you go and peach about elsewhere.
   1037791|00000000||Blacksmithing tools… but ornamented? Gotta be the ones Yoana mentioned.
    508121|00000000||It shan't continue long.
    508123|00000000||And yet the count, that parvenu swine - *spits* - managed to save his neck!
    508145|00000000||That's not all! Rumor has it the count's returned and now wreaks havoc in Novigrad.
    508125|00000000||That's extraordinarily interesting.
    508147|00000000||You don't say? I wouldn't be so quick to believe.
    510095|00000000||Might I interest you in a chess match?
    510096|00000000||Absolutely.
    508127|00000000||Why, greetings, greetings.
    508129|00000000||Splendid weather we're having.
    508131|00000000||Yeees?
    508153|00000000||Akh.
    508149|00000000||Well, well. A witcher.
    508151|00000000||The famed Geralt of Rivia, I presume?
    508133|00000000||Have we not met before, in Loc Muinne, perchance?
    508135|00000000||Beg your pardon!
    508137|00000000||What's the meaning of this…?
    508139|00000000||Help!
    508141|00000000||Eternal Fire…
    508143|00000000||Your wares lack luster, stall keeper.
   1043897|00000000||Outrageous! A thief!
   1002274|00000000||Don't care about your sister?
   1002276|00000000||Strange… People'd usually prefer to know the fate of their loved ones, whatever the cost.
    592051|00000000||What good will it do? I'll not get my sister back, and Niellen's all I got left.
   1002277|00000000||I can't lose him, too. And, well, he'll not rest till he avenges his Hanna, even if it eats up his life.
   1002327|00000000||The man deserves better.
    469106|00000000||Witcher?
    592040|00000000||What're you doing here? Shouldn't be in the forest alone.
    592042|00000000||I came to tell you… You needn't look for Hanna. She'd 'ave returned long past were she alive.
    592044|00000000||I'll pay you twice Niellen's pledge - just tell the man his Hanna's dead.
   1002318|00000000||Don't wanna know what happened to her?
   1002320|00000000||I've no illusions, witcher. In Velen, you're gone as long as she's been, you don't come back.
   1002323|00000000||Hanna's dead for certain. Niellen ought to accept his loss, move on with his life.
    469139|00000000||I'll find her.
    551728|00000000||Sorry. Not in the habit of leaving jobs undone.
    551729|00000000||Folk speak true about you witchers - you're heartless beasts.
    469137|00000000||Agreed.
    551726|00000000||Hmm… You could be right.
    551727|00000000||Thank you. My sister, she'd appreciate you givin' her man the chance to start anew.
    549374|00000000||Ahh… From the moment we first met, I knew I'd have to kick your asses someday.
    549375|00000000||At him!
    549371|00000000||If you want.
    549376|00000000||About face! And back to the latrines, get cleaning.
    549377|00000000||Yes, sir!
    549797|00000000||For glory! For Radovid!
    549372|00000000||Leave me alone.
    549378|00000000||Here. Take this coin, buy yourselves some vodka, and knock one back to my health.
    549379|00000000||Think you can buy your way out of this?
    549380|00000000||Clamp it shut. We'll take the coin.
    549373|00000000||Take this coin.
    549367|00000000||Hey, spy! Remember us?!
    549368|00000000||Ah, greedy and greedier. Ever get to drink that vodka?
    549369|00000000||Officer made us clean the latrines. 'Twere your doin'.
    549370|00000000||You got to pay for that.
   1002852|185476be||Cleaver's Henchman
    423865|00000000||It's you! The White Wolf! The famous Geralt of Rivia, am I right?
    423873|00000000||You hear about me?
    423875|00000000||Hear about you? Why, I know all there is to know! Learned it from Dandelion himself, who's forever telling stories of you and your adventures together.
    433678|00000000||Of your hunt for the dragon, and how you outfoxed the sylvan midst the hemp, of the Battle for the Bridge, and how he saved you from bandits…
    423913|00000000||Like to hear that one some time myself.
    423915|00000000||One never tires of Dandelion's tales and ballads! Why, all will be amazed when I tell them the Wolf himself takes joy in listening to them!
    423919|00000000||Now, tell me how I may be of service. Something to wet your tongue?
    423923|00000000||What do you have to drink that's good?
    423845|00000000||I'd like to buy something.
   1028748|00000000||A game of gwent - how about it?
   1086490|00000000||You play gwent?
    423929|00000000||Take care, now.
    423849|00000000||Farewell.
    423859|00000000||Worked here long?
    423942|00000000||You worked here long? Earlier, I mean?
    423944|00000000||Under old Mr. Wily, you mean? Why no. I answered a notice. What did it say…?
    433709|00000000||"Help wanted, to assist in the oversight of an exclusive establishment with refined diversions. Baccalaureate freshly gained, ten years of tavern experience a plus, knowledge of the Common Tongue, Elder Tongue and contemporary poetry required."
    433711|00000000||Hm, wouldn't you 'ave been better off staying at the academy, or--
    433721|00000000||Bah, I never passed the entrance exam. Neither do I know a lick of Elder, though I can, indeed, play a ditty or three.
    433727|00000000||Also, I've committed all Master Dandelion's works to memory.
    433811|00000000||Ah, I see.
    423921|00000000||Greetings, White Wolf! What comforts might we provide today?
    591490|00000000||Don't want trouble.
    591493|00000000||You go your way, I'll go mine.
    591494|00000000||Wise choice.
    591495|00000000||Take his head. And we leave this gods forsaken place.
   1075924|00000000||You're not taking anything. Need proof? Take his medallion.
   1075926|00000000||We will take his head. You are one, we are three.
   1075928|00000000||Mhm, but in the time it took me to run up, Letho dropped six of yours, with a bolt in his chest. How long'll it take me to kill you, whaddaya think?
   1075931|00000000||Ben, take the medallion. The head could rot before we arrived at our destination.
   1075934|00000000||Saddle the horses! We ride!
   1075918|00000000||His medallion's all you need.
   1075917|00000000||Changed my mind - you gotta die.
   1075920|00000000||His head stays where it is. Instead, I'll take yours.
    591491|00000000||What do I say? Simple - you're good as dead.
    591489|00000000||You're good as dead.
    591454|00000000||We were passing by… Decided it was time to finally meet the famous Arnout Vester in person.
    595760|00000000||I am flattered. Shame we'll not get to know one another better.
    591462|00000000||Why? Going somewhere?
    595765|00000000||No. Simply because I will kill you in a moment.
    595767|00000000||Wanna kill me, but you don't even know me. Not nice. Think I have to punish you for that.
    595768|00000000||But I won't kill you. I'll just cut off your hands.
    595770|00000000||Cut off all your hands. One man after the other.
    595773|00000000||Till the end of your days, those stumps'll remind you of the mistake you made.
    595774|00000000||Bloody hell! You fucking dimwit! I hadn't time to exchange two words with the man!
    595821|00000000||He provoked me!
    595823|00000000||We have no quarrel with you, but one false move and--
    595825|00000000||And what?
   1075915|00000000||You will end like him. What say you to that?
   1075887|00000000||Enough to buy me an estate in Kovir, where I will lie about eating fruit till the end of my days.
   1075889|00000000||Not bad. Not every man gets to know the price on his head.
   1075891|00000000||Most men would prefer not to have one.
   1075895|00000000||But why have you come? To make my life easier?
    591451|00000000||Letho of Gulet… Good to see you alive and well.
    595752|00000000||Funny. Second time today I've heard that lie.
    591453|00000000||It is no lie. You will certainly fetch a higher bounty alive.
    595756|00000000||Really. How much?
    591433|00000000||What the blazes?
    591434|00000000||A bolt o' lightnin' or somethin'?
    591435|00000000||Shut up, all of you!
    592806|00000000||Plug your ears.
   1075883|00000000||Stay here. And don't interfere - no matter what happens.
   1001648|00000000||What's in the barn?
   1001650|00000000||H-h-hay.
    590924|00000000||Got company?
   1001642|00000000||Run and find your parents. Tell them to grab whatever's valuable, take you and flee. Got it?
   1001657|00000000||Good. Give this to your mother. Now run.
   1001644|00000000||What was that?
   1001646|00000000||Compensation.
   1071311|00000000||Oof, hard fight, tough goin'.
   1071313|00000000||Aye. Haven't seen that many all at once in a while.
   1071562|00000000||We shouldn't o' come here. Got no business traipsin' about.
   1071564|00000000||Managed the one time, but who the hell knows what we'll find deeper in.
   1071567|00000000||That fear talkin'? Through you? Brawny Bert?
   1071569|00000000||Who, me? Fear? Not on your life!
   1071571|00000000||All right, boys, let's move on. At pace! Show these horrors who's in charge!
   1055372|ad41ad88||Alghoul
    550576|00000000||Cleaver's is bigger, he's hung like a horse.
    550577|00000000||Hehehe, clear that you've not seen Reuven's…
    550761|00000000||Gudrun calls it "Uroboros."
    550763|00000000||Hee-hee-hee! Does it loop back on itself?
    432590|d184d9f7||Wraith
    572081|00000000||Ptooey!
    572083|00000000||Fuckin' hate whores.
    572085|00000000||Finkin's punishable by death.
   1073193|00000000||Come on, then!
    572089|00000000||You prick!
    572087|00000000||Waitin' here with my prick in me hands.
   1073187|00000000||Hey, wisarse, put that dagger away.
   1073189|00000000||Fuckin' calm yourself!
   1073191|00000000||So, you crackin', graymug?
   1010509|00000000||That's all I have on me…
   1010510|00000000||Ain't much.
   1010511|00000000||Now sod off.
   1010518|00000000||They took everything…
   1004311|00000000||Tell me, did she cry?
   1004312|00000000||She was scared a bit. Went on and on, naggin' about mosquitoes…
   1004313|00000000||Then she spotted the Trail of Treats - forgot about all else…
   1004314|00000000||Then I've got to try, too…
    515894|00000000||Will you join the tournament? Eh? A bit of honest fist fightin' to clear the lungs and bowels.
    527666|00000000||Though I warn you, Jonah can be fierce. Likes to bite, get me? So, what'll it be?
    515904|00000000||All right, let's see just how fierce Jonah is.
    515905|00000000||Feast your eyes on an epic clash between Jonah and the drifter!
    540564|00000000||Let's do this.
    540566|00000000||Another showdown - Jonah and the drifter! Fight!
    515896|00000000||I'm ready.
    515899|00000000||Some other time.
    515898|00000000||I don't fight.
    515897|00000000||What kind of fighting is this?
    515900|00000000||What're the rules?
    515901|00000000||We mostly use fists, but no one looks askance at the stray kick to the stones.
    540556|00000000||Defeat Jonah, then Smithy and Stan Fishgulper, and you'll earn the right to face the sergeant - Velen's champion.
    540561|00000000||Wanna fight again.
    540563|00000000||No problem at all!
   1036794|00000000||Corpses… that's what drew the ghouls.
    436643|00000000||It's done! Open the door!
    549310|00000000||Be glad to help. Where's Jackamar buried?
    549311|00000000||A little cemetery near Blackbough… In a grave 'neath the old tree.
    549313|00000000||Here, take me ring. Once you've laid it down, come to me for your reward. I live in a hut in the middle of the village with my granddaughter, Lessy.
    549308|00000000||I can do it.
    549301|00000000||Sorry, can't help.
    549306|00000000||Sorry… Ghosts aren't my specialty.
    549307|00000000||That much is obvious…
    550081|00000000||What?
    550083|00000000||Nothin', nothin'. The gods guide ye.
    550084|00000000||Not interested.
    549309|00000000||Sure it's your husband's ghost?
    550089|00000000||Sure it's your husband's ghost?
    550091|00000000||Ye sayin' I can't tell me own man? I'm old, but ain't gone daft yet!
    550093|00000000||Not what I meant. There's wraiths that deceive, assume the form of dead loved ones. Trows, for instance, or dunnies…
    550095|00000000||Naye, I'm sure this is Jackamar. In me dreams he spoke of our nuptuals, how we danced at Belleteyn, how the Redanians killed him at Rinde…
    550097|00000000||Rinde? You've either mixed something up, or you're very old indeed. Battle happened eighty years ago.
    550099|00000000||Oh, aye, slip o' the tongue. Meant to say the Battle of Rivia.
    549302|00000000||Can you tell me anything more?
    549303|00000000||You see, Jackamar haunts me dreams… Jackamar's me husband, or was till he died at war.
    549305|00000000||He stands by me headboard and wails: "So many years apart, I've such woe in the beyond, come join me."
    550075|00000000||I say, "I'll come, Jackamar, but when the gods summon me, not before." Then he says, "Leave your weddin' ring by me grave, it'll make the waitin' lighter." And I'd leave it… were the woods not so terryfin'.
    550077|00000000||So I thought to meself… Maybe you…?
    549300|00000000||Tell me more.
    549298|00000000||What's the matter? A monster bothering you?
    549299|00000000||Naye. A ghost.
   1063080|00000000||Word is some filth's made its nest in the secret passage to the Grove.
   1063082|00000000||Folk fuckin' chatter like they're addled. See beasts everywhere - down the sewer, round the corner, up their wench's twat.
   1063084|00000000||Could be somethin' to this, though. Stjepan, he used that passage, and that wasn't no human hand that felled him.
   1063086|00000000||Oh, right. Truth be told, I like that way myself. Can't stand the bloody fool who mans the gate.
   1063088|00000000||"Old sow's farrowed piglets…" Where's he get those ploughin' passwords? Piss on the beasts - rather risk it than haggle with some idiot.
   1063090|00000000||Any beast comes out to greet me, I'll smash it, slice it right up. I'm goin' out.
   1064479|00000000||Me too.
    524716|00000000||Drippin' like the squirrel-eaten prick of a dead lumberjack.
    526098|00000000||We're stuck 'tween a rock and a hard place, so it's high time to get the fuck out.
    526100|00000000||I hear there's some shady character can arrange a crossin' of the Pontar.
    525271|00000000||Elven blarney.
    526102|00000000||Know if anyone's got any hooch left?
    526104|00000000||Argh. No use tirin' me tongue about that.
    525275|00000000||Roamed the forests of Kaedwen, Vergen, and now the mouth of the Pontar. Wonder what's next.
    525443|00000000||What's our witcher friend doin' here?
    525445|00000000||Got thistles growin' on me back from all this sneakin' about in the woods.
    525274|00000000||Aaaaargh…
    525431|00000000||Mahakam!
    525433|00000000||Like that, you bitch?!
    524718|00000000||Death to all whoresons!
    525272|00000000||We must stick together.
    525417|00000000||Me guts're near twisted from hunger.
    525441|00000000||Ptooey!
    525277|00000000||Fuckin' shit!
    525279|00000000||Wanna whiff of me axe?
    525419|00000000||Don't kill me…
    525421|00000000||Ever had your kneecaps broken?
    525423|00000000||Scoia'tael! Attack!
    525425|00000000||Shit!
    525427|00000000||Shut your eyes!
    525429|00000000||Duvvel hoael!
    571516|00000000||I'll be back…
   1065589|00000000||Still don't know if I'll help.
   1065615|00000000||Came by 'cause I'm curious.
   1065617|00000000||But you will help?
   1065619|00000000||We'll see. Need to know what you expect of me, first.
   1065588|00000000||Radovid's gotta die - for Triss and Yen's good.
   1065599|00000000||Thought about what you said… that Triss and Yen would never be safe as long as Radovid was alive.
   1065601|00000000||You better believe it. Well, I'm pleased we've arrived at an understanding. To the matter at hand.
   1065987|00000000||Fine. I'll talk to Gregor.
   1065989|00000000||Thank you. And try not to draw too much attention… if you can.
   1068266|00000000||Remember, the future hinges on the success of this mission. The future of Temeria, the future of the North.
   1068268|00000000||I know. I'll try not to fuck it up. See you.
   1070509|00000000||We're counting on you, Geralt.
   1065975|00000000||I'll find your associate.
   1066016|00000000||Know what - rather not get involved. Stinks of politics from miles away.
   1066040|00000000||Geralt, give it some thought. If you change your mind, find Gregor. Talk to him.
   1066053|00000000||I'll consider it. Promise you that much. But that's all.
   1065978|00000000||Sorry, not interested.
   1065979|00000000||Got informers in the Redanian army?
   1065982|00000000||Let a Redanian soldier in on your plan to murder Redania's king?
   1065984|00000000||Ahh, you see? There are even some Redanians who cannot abide Radovid's policies.
   1065986|00000000||And when simple soldiers notice something's not quite right, well, then it's time to act.
   1065709|00000000||All right, what do you want from me?
   1065713|00000000||One of our co-conspirators ventured out to meet an informer. He's not returned, yet the plan's success hinges on what he's learned.
   1065717|00000000||We've got to find him. And you're the best tracker around.
   1065972|00000000||Tracker, huh? Really.
   1065977|00000000||Anything else you can tell me? Where this associate was last seen, for instance?
   1065974|00000000||He's traveling as a journeyman. Itinerant cobbler - that's his cover. He was first to venture across the Pontar, most probably did so via the Redanian checkpoint. We've a man there who should know more. Calls himself Gregor.
   1065693|00000000||What do you want from me?
   1065692|00000000||What do you mean?
   1067244|00000000||How's that work? Seems to me Radovid is Temeria's ally.
   1067248|00000000||Only as long as my guerillas do what pleases him, support his troops. Once he wins the war, he'll not acknowledge the previous borders nor wish to restore them.
   1067252|00000000||He dreams of a northern empire. As long as he lives, Temeria will never be free.
   1067246|00000000||But we didn't bring you here to bore you with politics. Radovid's a threat to Triss and Yennefer. Remember that. That ought to interest you most.
   1065622|00000000||I believe you know my associate.
   1065630|00000000||Roche? You, here?
   1065688|00000000||Retired intelligence operatives - we've a club.
   1065690|00000000||Defended a king once… Ready to assassinate another, now?
   1065649|00000000||Not proud of it. Yet… I considered all the options and found none better.
   1070505|00000000||Radovid's proven many times he only ever forwards his own interests. When Kaedwen asked for help, he invaded. When I begged him to support Vizima's defense, he showed me the door.
   1068240|00000000||The war nears its end, we've come to a decisive phase. We must act quickly.
   1067242|00000000||I've no illusions. Only a dead Radovid means a free Temeria.
   1065597|00000000||Got your invitation, decided to come. That simple. Let's get down to business.
   1065587|00000000||Down to business.
   1070472|00000000||Geralt. You're here, good.
   1070475|00000000||Might've chosen a more secluded spot to plot an assassination.
   1070477|00000000||It's on everyone's mind, many'd like to do it, so there's nothing to fear.
   1070479|00000000||Besides, this venue's got a tradition in this domain. Might even consider it fabled. Falka planned her revolt here… by extension, King Vridank's murder, too.
   1070481|00000000||Comparing yourself to Falka? Far as I recall, no one in Redania's annals has a bloodier reputation.
   1070483|00000000||Her rebellion changed the course of history - that's what we have in common. In terms of blood, we aim only to shed Radovid's.
   1064162|00000000||I'm pleased you're willing to play a part. Must admit I wasn't certain you'd show.
    418821|00000000||What do you want?
    175926|00000000||Rosa var Attre's expecting me. Supposed to give her lessons in swordplay.
    175928|00000000||Come with me. Miss Rosa awaits.
    418823|00000000||I'm the new swordplay instructor.
    418825|00000000||I'm the new cook.
    418834|00000000||I'm the new cook.
    418836|00000000||And them pointy things stickin' out behind you, they your cleavers?
    418838|00000000||Away with you, vagrant.
    429791|00000000||Wanna see Rosa var Attre.
    430679|00000000||Oh, mate, if you only knew what I want... Miss Rosa don't see just anybody.
    430681|00000000||I'm Geralt of Rivia, a witcher.
    429793|00000000||Soon as Miss Rosa turns into a striga, I'm sure her papa'll send for you. But she's not showin' any symptoms yet, so I venture you're not needed. On your way, now.
    429757|00000000||Looking for Rosa var Attre.
    418840|00000000||Nothing. Wrong house.
    418827|00000000||Wrong house, on my way.
    429811|00000000||Thanks, we ain't lookin' for no witcher.
    422140|00000000||What's this? Didn't hear me tell you we ain't lookin' for no cook? Sod off!
    572158|00000000||Go fuck your mum's tits. *Spits*
    572160|00000000||Got a feelin' I'm in for the shits today.
    572164|00000000||Oi, white arse.
   1073261|00000000||Now?! Or else?!
    572162|00000000||And fuck his mealy noggin'!
    572166|00000000||Criminy!
   1073255|00000000||Piss off with that sword of yours.
   1073257|00000000||You're startin' to annoy me, grayboy.
   1073259|00000000||Wise choice, arsewipe.
    467274|40b3f5c5||Refugee
    568207|00000000||I wanna talk.
    568209|00000000||Dunno. Wanna talk first. Why'd you kill those guards?
    594253|00000000||I was careless, let them surprise me. They wished to kill me, I had to defend myself.
   1032919|00000000||That it? No heartrending story about human hatred for all things different, all things strange?
   1032921|00000000||I'm not one to lie. Nor do I kill without reason.
    568216|00000000||You gotta leave the city.
    594263|00000000||And what if I don't?
    594265|00000000||I'll have to kill you.
    594267|00000000||I despise change. How stupid of me to walk into an ambush, let myself be surprised.
    568218|00000000||I'll have to lie about killing you. Usually I bring a trophy…
    568225|00000000||Very well. Take this. And this - because I'm furious with you. Though I shall calm down once I'm away from this place.
    568213|00000000||You need to leave the city.
    568214|00000000||Gotta kill you.
    568219|00000000||Gotta understand. I can't let it happen again.
    568220|00000000||Yes. I saw murder in your eyes the moment you entered.
   1017993|00000000||You shouldn't have come here.
   1017995|00000000||Who ordains so?
   1017997|00000000||It's a human city, belongs to them. And I protect them from the likes of you.
   1032898|00000000||So it's true what they say about witchers - you're but murderers for hire.
    568206|00000000||You got it.
    568200|00000000||Who are you?
    568203|00000000||Ever heard of witchers?
    568204|00000000||Have you come to kill me?
   1003751|00000000||Gotta admit, your Menge - it's a brilliant impersonation.
   1003753|00000000||Don't remind me. I'm rather disgusted.
   1003755|00000000||Come on, he wasn't all out terrible.
   1003757|00000000||You understand nothing. A doppler assumes more than a man's external appearance. I've learnt what a scoundrel had knocking about in his head.
   1003759|00000000||Once I became him, not an hour passed before I felt the urge to break a sorceress' fingers. After two I caught myself lusting to impale someone, and immediately after that it hit me - the paranoic fear of a doppler conspiracy.
   1003734|00000000||How's it feel to be Caleb Menge?
   1003775|00000000||Dudu, tell me - the halfling Biberveldt goes from being a properous merchant to being a pauper. How?
   1003777|00000000||Prefer the long version or the short?
   1003779|00000000||Short, please.
   1003781|00000000||The war.
   1003783|00000000||I was under the impression merchants grow fat on wars.
   1003785|00000000||Some do, but I've a serious personality flaw - I'm honest. I could not reap profits from the suffering of others, I paid taxes, I never cooked my books.
   1003787|00000000||And then a ship full of my goods sank. I pulled through somehow, but then a second fell prey to Skelligan raiders, rendering me insolvent.
   1003789|00000000||When inflation hit, and interest rates rose, I, at long last, fell.
   1003735|00000000||Used to be wealthy - what happened?
    359447|00000000||Take care of yourself, Dudu.
    359427|00000000||Oh, those bigots haven't the cunning to strip me of this mask.
    359445|00000000||So long.
   1003733|00000000||Wouldn't you rather leave?
   1003737|00000000||Ever considered leaving, forgetting Novigrad altogether?
   1003739|00000000||What for - to pass from the frying pan into the fire? The war's not yet crept here, famine's not kicked at our door. Not that the future's looking rosy…
   1003741|00000000||But you don't have to be human. Maybe you could try something else?
   1003743|00000000||I've assumed many forms over the years, and in spite of all, life as a human has proven most interesting. After all, you humans rule the world.
    359430|00000000||How are things, Dudu?
    335255|00000000||So-so, I suppose. Might've been days in the past when I'd 'ave said "wonderful," but I can't complain. I'm in one piece, not bound to a stake atop a pyre.
   1024554|00000000||Greetings.
   1075851|00000000||You've been Menge, now you're Whoreson Junior.
   1075853|00000000||Apparently, you must be a rogue to survive in this city.
    503699|00000000||Master Claytop heartily greets the challenger!
    503700|00000000||Greetings to Master Claytop from Geralt.
    516284|00000000||Will you take up the challenge? Will you face our tavern's champion?
    516309|00000000||Let us talk coin. I shall be blunt - you stand to earn a great deal… provided you follow a few recommendations.
    516315|00000000||You asking me to cheat?
    516317|00000000||Not to cheat - to engage in an enterprise, that is all. What say you?
    503719|00000000||I'm all ears.
    503722|00000000||How much'll you give me to throw the fight?
    516329|00000000||Considerably more than if you win.
    503724|00000000||Kiss my ass, Master Claytop.
    540574|00000000||You'll regret that.
    503721|00000000||Not about to cheat.
    503720|00000000||I'm in.
    503727|00000000||A bucket of coin for taking some hits to the face? Tempting offer. I'm in. What do I do?
    516346|00000000||Nothing much. Throw some punches, not too many, mind, and then let him drop you.
    503737|00000000||A warm welcome to our competitors as they enter the ring! Geralt versus Georgius Georg, the Piledriver. May the better man win!
    504106|00000000||The rules are childishly simple. Defeat Georg, you get a bulging purse.
    504107|00000000||Anything else I should know?
    504108|00000000||Put on a good show, and the crowd will love you.
    503709|00000000||Yeah, I'll fight this Gregorio fellow.
    516297|00000000||Your attention, please! This fine witcher has agreed to join in battle with our tavern's champion - Georgius Georg!
    503710|00000000||While our champion prepares, you and I should have a chat.
    503701|00000000||I'm ready to fight.
    503704|00000000||Maybe later.
    503703|00000000||Some other time.
   1053255|00000000||Welcome back! Prepared to fight?
   1040523|00000000||Strange. My medallion's trembling, but there's nothing here… What's with this wall?
   1040792|00000000||Meaning what?
   1040527|00000000||The Eye of Nehaleni. It dispels illusions. It's easy enough to build, so you're welcome to this one. It's bound to come in handy.
   1040804|00000000||And, each time it does, you will think of me.
   1040802|00000000||Hm, thanks.
   1040525|00000000||It's an illusion. I sensed it as well.
   1040790|00000000||I expected we might run into such things, so I brought this.
   1040586|00000000||Simple, isn't it?
   1040588|00000000||Mhm. Let's see where the passage leads.
    499103|00000000||To the point.
    499110|00000000||Nice bird. But to the matter at hand.
    499092|00000000||She's an owl, not a parrot.
    499124|00000000||Zoltan, venture to say a mage would have trouble turning that owl into a parrot…
    499126|00000000||Sure you know me that well? Mark my words, she'll be playin' gwent with us in no time.
    499127|00000000||But we were to talk about Dandelion.
    499192|00000000||Think I might have something interesting.
    499219|00000000||Hmm… Think I might have something better.
    499220|00000000||What're you waitin' for? Let's have at it!
    437402|00000000||Why wasn't she on the list?
    437408|00000000||Why wasn't she on the list?
    437410|00000000||Hm, this Priscilla was'ne like the others… Think Dandelion more'n fancied her, think it was fervor…
    437412|00000000||He lusts after every other woman he meets.
    437414|00000000||How can I explain…? Who does Dandelion love most?
    502179|00000000||Himself.
    502181|00000000||Exactly. And she's his mirror image.
    327860|00000000||Doubt it.
    328113|00000000||Hm. Dandelion in love? Actually, truly in love?
    514003|00000000||Ooh, yes.
    499279|00000000||The laddie's head's on fire. Lassy's got him whirlin'.
    499280|00000000||All right. Guess we gotta talk to her.
    328171|00000000||Priscilla works with a mummers' troupe - "Renarde and the Foxen." Whenever they're in town, she performs nightly at the Kingfisher.
    328284|00000000||Mean we've been sentenced to an evening of poetry?
    328286|00000000||Must ye always? This'll be true poetry, Geralt. You'll see.
    328111|00000000||What can I say - could be he finally met his match.
    514002|00000000||She's his match, all right - maybe more.
    327858|00000000||That's big news…
    437404|00000000||Who's this Priscilla?
    437406|00000000||A trobairitz, like you said. Quite popular of late. Picture Dandelion with a pair o' tits and you've got the general idea.
    437416|00000000||Interesting image. So how'd Dandelion handle meeting his female double?
    437418|00000000||I think he fell in love.
    437392|00000000||Who's Priscilla?
    437376|00000000||Women on my list hadn't seen Dandelion in a while. All claimed he'd been acting strange. Also mentioned he'd been seeing someone else.
    499235|00000000||Thing is, mystery woman wasn't on my list.
    437380|00000000||What's she supposedly like, this lass?
    437382|00000000||Blonde, from Kovir. A trobairitz, apparently. Named Callonetta or something like that.
    437386|00000000||Ach, that makes it clear as crystal!
    437388|00000000||It's Priscilla, aye - must be her.
    437356|00000000||Think I got something.
    437360|00000000||You first.
    437362|00000000||Tell me what you've got first.
    437364|00000000||A few bruises and a torn doublet…
    437368|00000000||Otherwise, no' much of note. He wasn't stayin' with any of 'em, they'd not seen hide nor hair of 'im in ages… All I learned was a few of Dandelion's pick-up lines - of dubious worth.
    499191|00000000||Let's hear them.
    499193|00000000||Let's hear 'em. I'm all ears.
    499195|00000000||Ahh, know how he wooed a lass studyin' natural history? Asked her about the habits of trolls. Hmph.
    499198|00000000||And know where he went with the cook from the Passiflora? The Oxenfurt - Novigrad road, which is just now bein' repaired.
    499206|00000000||Made her stare for hours as laborers crushed boulders into cobblestones, and tried to pass it off as a romantic outing!
    499200|00000000||Don't know about human women, but that would bore a dwarven lass to tears. He's growin' old, that poet of ours…
    499208|00000000||Maybe… or maybe he did all that for a reason.
    526118|00000000||Sounds like you've found somethin' out…
    499121|00000000||So. How'd you do? Learn much?
    499102|00000000||That Field Marshal Duda's replacement? The marshal was a parrot - you do remember, right? Where'd you get her?
    499107|00000000||At auction. Some mage's estate went under the hammer. Witch hunters and the Eternal Fire joined forces, staked out his place and rounded the sorry sap up.
    499108|00000000||Put his things up for sale. Happened to be passin' by and saw this owl… Came with her own cage…
    499118|00000000||How could you resist?
    499119|00000000||Couldn't. 'Tweren't possible. Ach, but Dandelion's what matters now.
    499091|00000000||Where'd you get her?
    437350|00000000||Ah, you're back! You met Poppy? She ought to start talkin' any day now.
    492671|00000000||How're you keepin', Poppy? Miss your Zoltan, you old bird?
    492672|00000000||What's this? Haven't even drunk our water? Naughty bird!
    492673|00000000||Now repeat: Savorrrry crrrrrackerrrrs.
   1010029|00000000||What a downpour.
   1010027|00000000||Good day.
   1010025|00000000||Good day.
   1010023|00000000||"Welcome, welcome," they say, but spit on the nonhuman the moment I turn away.
   1010021|00000000||Que suecc's?
   1010019|00000000||No. No!
   1015167|00000000||Good day.
   1034201|00000000||You cannot kill me. You know this…
    423976|00000000||Greetings! My, my - a witcher! Somethin' tells me I'll finally get somethin' interestin' to do!
    423978|00000000||Sure doesn't look like you're short on work.
    423980|00000000||Oh, this! A Redanian army order, but there's no pleasure in it - one after the other, same thing time and again. No finesse required!
    423982|00000000||Lookin' to perfect your craft?
    423984|00000000||Of course! Craftin's like ploughin' a maid: fall into a rut, and, sure, you'll get the job done, but there'll be no whoops, no hollers, no standing ovation. So, got any special requests for me, help me stay on form?
    423986|00000000||Still talking about armor, aren't we?
    423988|00000000||Aye, what else would it be?
    423997|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    423950|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1028750|00000000||Let's play cards. Gwent wouldn't be bad.
   1086511|00000000||Play me? Gwent?
    423992|00000000||So long.
    423954|00000000||Farewell.
    423952|00000000||I'd like you to craft something for me.
    423999|00000000||You're in luck - actually do have a special order for you.
    424001|00000000||That's fantastic! Mark my words, you'll be satisfied!
    423990|00000000||Greetings again! So, you got a job for me, an interesting one?
   1055084|06691856||Peasant
   1041648|00000000||There a problem?
   1041671|00000000||There a problem?
   1041673|00000000||A problem? There some kinda problem here, gents? Nooo. Just wanted you to meet my new pals, 'fore they bugger the fuck off. 'Cause we're just partin', right?
   1038559|00000000||You can handle this.
   1038555|00000000||You can handle this, Zoltan.
   1038557|00000000||Sure. Or I might just discover I look great without ears… or hands. Apparently the King of Beggars accepts both as partial payment.
   1042138|00000000||Ugh, all right, I'll think about it.
   1042142|00000000||Thanks. So long, Geralt.
   1038561|00000000||Fine. We'll try to hunt down those cards. Which ones you need?
   1038563|00000000||Fringilla Vigo, Isengrim, and John Natalis. Devilish hard to get hold of. Duke's been tryin', too, hasn't had any luck.
   1038565|00000000||Wait, you don't even know where to look for these cards?
   1041842|00000000||Naah, it's not as bad as that. I'm bettin' Zed's got them. He quit fencin' recently, only deals in cards now.
   1041847|00000000||Unfortunately, the arsewipe won't talk to me, not after I bought a one-of-a-kind Scoia'tael card out from under his nose. Would you mind goin' to see 'im?
   1041859|00000000||Zed… Hm, sounds familiar.
   1041860|00000000||Big fish in the card pond. Has a shop along the south wall. And… thank ye, Geralt. I actually think I stand to pay off this debt now.
   1041872|00000000||No problem. See you later, Zoltan.
   1038558|00000000||I'll help you.
   1041724|00000000||What's this all about? Doing business with them?
   1041726|00000000||Exactly the ploughin' opposite. You see, Geralt, old pal--
   1041728|00000000||About to ask me for help, aren't you?
   1041729|00000000||Thing is, I sorta kinda owe a wee sum to our mutual acquaintance, Francis Bedlam, the King of Beggars.
   1041738|00000000||To pay off the debt, I've made up my mind to get serious about gwent.
   1041740|00000000||Getting better by the minute.
   1041751|00000000||Not the playin' of it, mind ye, but the cards themselves. Rarest of 'em fetch princely sums these days. Sadly, that's not exactly arcane knowledge.
   1041752|00000000||Got a buyer in heat for my collection, missin' just three cards. But Duke's dregs are all over my arse. So… whaddaya say, Geralt?
   1038551|00000000||What's this all about?
   1038552|00000000||Friends of yours?
   1041699|00000000||Shady, those guys. Who were they?
   1041713|00000000||Er, puffed-up fish bladder's Duke. Word is he's out to be the new Whoreson Junior, but the bugger's missin' a helluva lot.
   1041886|00000000||Specifically coin, influence, men, and class.
   1041717|00000000||And the other?
   1041719|00000000||Earl. A scumjug like few others. Skin on my arse twitches at the sight of 'im.
   1042340|00000000||Back in Mahakam we'd send sowbuggers like that down the coalface with a bundle o' powder and a leaky lamp.
   1041693|00000000||Ech, well, that puts me up to the neck in fuckin' shite without a shovel.
   1041662|00000000||We'll have our reckoning yet, Chivay. Soon.
   1041664|00000000||What's this? Some flea-ridden mutant got you scared, Duke? Just say the word, I'll take care of 'im.
   1038550|00000000||Take a peek at what he's got inside, then make the midget eat it. Sound good?
   1041682|00000000||Next time, Earl. Let's go.
   1041690|00000000||Right! And don't show yer hides 'round here ever again! Ptooey!
   1041669|00000000||What's this about?
   1042345|00000000||Ach, nothin'. I just wanted you to meet my new pals 'fore they bugger the fuck off. 'Cause we were just partin', right?
   1041613|00000000||What's going on?
   1038503|00000000||The last individual who tried to come in on my business - it took them a month to find him. Am I being clear, Chivay?
   1041598|00000000||What's the fuss about? Can you not treat me as a bit of healthy competition?
   1041597|00000000||Why you even talkin' to him, Duke? I've always maintained two smashed knees are worth a thousand words.
   1038507|00000000||Oh ho ho, Geralt! Glad ye came.
   1004747|00000000||I'll tell you… I'll tell you where the loot's at…
   1004748|00000000||Heheh… Your mates split the loot between 'em long ago.
   1004749|00000000||Least that's what I woulda done. And you shut it now.
   1004750|00000000||Save your strength, die with some dignity.
    424973|00000000||Where's Whoreson Junior?
    424977|00000000||All right. Tired of this charade. Where's Whoreson Junior?
    427501|00000000||So you've come to kill him after all…?
    456068|00000000||Takes a real genius to notice. Where is he?
    459714|00000000||At him! And he needn't survive!
    440395|00000000||Junior doesn't believe in miracles.
    440399|00000000||This is where cheats learn just how much he dislikes being robbed.
    424979|00000000||Work him over. Once you're done, wrap a nice thick chain around his legs and drop him in the Pontar.
    424975|00000000||Doesn't look too cozy. Not a comfortable place to play cards.
    456066|00000000||Someone less trusting might take it for an interrogation room.
    424971|00000000||Looks like an interrogation room.
    424967|00000000||Private room for the chosen few. No one'll disturb you here.
    467972|00000000||Yeah, we're good. Get outta here before I change my mind.
    467974|00000000||Of course, master witcher. We're off. One-two-gone already!
    467958|00000000||Yeah, we're good.
    467962|00000000||Not quite. We'll be good once you give me your things.
    467968|00000000||All of them…?
    467970|00000000||You can keep your knickers.
    467960|00000000||We'll be good once you give me your things.
    451645|00000000||Know what rhymes with "wicked witcher"?
    467956|00000000||My things, before I turn you into mincemeat.
    451649|00000000||Must be a slant rhyme…
    451651|00000000||Shut your trap and give it back!
    544894|00000000||So then… We are square, even, good… yes?
    594433|00000000||We square?
    594429|00000000||Wouldn't know where me parrot is, would you?
    594431|00000000||I long to curl up with a bottle…
    455818|00000000||Begone… Reaper's the only one he'll talk to now…
   1032349|00000000||Shoulda buried 'im in the ground, like we did his granddad.
   1032351|00000000||You know what the Church says. Dead gotta be burned. Grave mounds are a pagan relic.
   1032353|00000000||That may be so… But where'm I supposed to lay flowers? Where'll I pour libations for my son?
   1032355|00000000||They said what to do durin' the sermon. 'Stead o' buyin' gifts for the dead, you oughta make an offerin' o' your gold to the Eternal Fire.
   1055682|b224b6d2||Devourer
    477733|3fbb3904||Nilfgaardian Officer
   1069966|00000000||The curse is lifted.
   1070630|00000000||And Graham and Anabelle're reunited.
   1032828|00000000||May the Flame that is the supreme power watch over us, keep us in its care.
   1032830|00000000||May it protect us and our kin from the ravages of war.
   1032832|00000000||May it shield our homes from the swelling tide.
   1032834|00000000||For all that is good and right begins and ends in its fire.
   1052270|00000000||Thanks for your help. Pretty tough slog.
   1053401|00000000||Good thing I came with you.
   1052272|00000000||You'd never have managed without me, would you? Come, now, admit it.
   1053405|00000000||Yeah. Never.
    592328|00000000||He awaits us…
   1073125|00000000||Another rift!
   1073120|00000000||Geralt, look! He's opening a passage!
   1073122|00000000||Stay calm. Focus.
   1033231|5112967a||Merchant
    519904|00000000||Who are you?
    519906|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, witcher.
    519908|00000000||We could use your kind if you'd find the heart to serve the Eternal Fire. I'm Tamara.
    519910|00000000||Heard quite a lot about you.
    519651|00000000||Your business. I won't meddle.
    519659|00000000||Your business. I refuse to meddle.
    519661|00000000||Rightly so.
    519652|00000000||We'd better find Anna.
    519683|00000000||Stop arguing. It's stupid. We need to find Anna.
    519794|00000000||You're a witcher. Will you help?
    581728|00000000||Scrubbed it good. Oy! Get back, stinky-head, gingerbread loaf, freshly baked and hot.
    581753|00000000||Mother…
    581756|00000000||Ah, there, clean as a whistle… fresh as a daisy… Go on, whip me, I made it too little, I nibbled it, but just to see if it's firm.
    581758|00000000||But it's fresh… so take pity.
    581760|00000000||Oh, mother…
    581763|00000000||Take pity.
    581771|00000000||Hssss… hssss…
    581776|00000000||M-m-m…
    592309|00000000||Don't!
    592312|00000000||Over here!
   1071652|00000000||Wouldn't be here if I wasn't willing.
    519812|00000000||I've lost five men and have little notion of what else to expect in this cursed place.
    519817|00000000||No time to lose. Crones could return any minute.
    519819|00000000||Hah. How do you know they're not here already?
    519825|00000000||Cause we're still alive.
    519814|00000000||Search the village!
    519732|00000000||Witcher, will you help us?
   1071596|00000000||"Verily I say unto you that ire and vehemence can lead to naught but one's downfall."
   1071623|00000000||Who the bloody hell is this?
   1071625|00000000||And who are you to ask so crudely?
    519686|00000000||This is my commander.
    519692|00000000||And that should to be of no concern to a drunken swine.
    519727|00000000||Tamara! You stand with their kind now? Perhaps you'd have them torture and hang your own father?
    519729|00000000||You're not my father. And I care not a bit what befalls you.
   1071650|00000000||A-hem. I remind you we've a matter to resolve here.
    519654|00000000||Your father - he wants to find his wife, your mother. Really.
    519656|00000000||He pay you much to be his yes-man?
    519650|00000000||Baron wants to find his wife.
    519509|00000000||Tamara, dear daughter! You return after all!
   1071576|00000000||Come, don't deny me this embrace…
   1071578|00000000||Stay away from me.
    519583|00000000||I've come for mother. Unlike you, I'll not see her rot in this swamp.
    519585|00000000||Why the hell do you think I'm here? To take her home.
    519587|00000000||Oh, you'll do no such thing. You'll not lay a finger on her. Never. I'll not let you.
   1071573|00000000||You've a right to be cross… I was not the best husband, the best father, I know.
    519649|00000000||But I've changed! Ask anyone! Geralt, come, tell her!
    519890|00000000||Witcher! Change your mind? How much did my father pay you?
    519891|00000000||Don't think you have anything to fear. Brought your new friends with you.
    519894|00000000||I have no fear for the Eternal Fire protects me.
    519900|00000000||Mm, won't need to protect you from me.
   1014428|00000000||Remember me, witcher? Vernossiel. The Scoia'tael you betrayed.
   1004907|00000000||Gods give me strength.
   1004908|00000000||Second day now I've promised the kids supper and I've naught to give 'em…
   1004909|00000000||They'll go to sleep hungry, again.
   1004910|00000000||Gods won't help you. Abandoned us long past.
    498456|00000000||One glance and the crowns'll leap from your purse!
   1086504|00000000||How about we play cards?
    422138|00000000||Farewell.
    422134|00000000||Farewell.
    422132|00000000||Show me what you got.
    422136|00000000||Lemme see what you're offering.
    422130|00000000||Come, sir, feast your eyes on my lovely baubles!
    427781|00000000||Run, fast!
    356382|00000000||Heard something awfully similar somewhere…
    356386|00000000||Could almost swear I've heard it before.
    356388|00000000||Really? Doesn't seem familiar to me… But, it's only a first draft, needs a lot of revision, lemme tell you.
    356384|00000000||Beautiful.
    356422|00000000||Wonderful, best you've every written. Now can we talk?
    356424|00000000||Well… honestly never expected my art could move the hardened heart of a witcher.
   1001798|00000000||Gotta tell me - how'd you wind up owning this… establishment?
   1001800|00000000||Hahahah! You'll never believe this! I inherited it - from none other than Alonso Wily, Whoreson Senior himself.
   1002180|00000000||You're right - I don't believe it.
   1002182|00000000||Alonso ruled the local underworld with an iron fist. But deep down he was a romantic, pure as they come…
   1002184|00000000||This place is one of the reasons his son's not my biggest fan. See, Cyprian - Junior, that is - wanted to make this a brothel, but the Rosemary went to me.
   1002186|00000000||And I plan to turn it into the most elegant venue in town. A den of art and culture.
   1001675|00000000||How'd you come to own a tavern?
   1002517|00000000||How'd you and Priscilla meet?
   1002522|00000000||Hmm… It was at the court of Duke Hereward - the Annual Balladry Contest. We faced off in the final.
   1002524|00000000||Who won?
   1002526|00000000||I don't remember.
   1002528|00000000||I bet. Probably lost and you don't wanna admit it.
   1002530|00000000||Actually, she'd caught my eye, so I let her win. I was counting on getting a prize after the contest.
   1002560|00000000||And? Did you?
   1002562|00000000||Hah. That, my friend, is not your concern.
    356340|00000000||Where'd you meet Priscilla?
   1074584|00000000||Found your ring, Here.
   1074587|00000000||Hah! Thanks so much! Thought I'd lost it.
   1074589|00000000||Got it from Priscilla, you know.
   1074591|00000000||Nice gift.
   1074593|00000000||She swore it had always brought her luck. Of course, I landed in that dungeon soon after she gave it to me. Oh well.
   1074582|00000000||Found your ring.
   1075332|00000000||Got a portrait of Hierarch Hemmelfart I'm willing to part with. Want it?
   1075352|00000000||Yes! Those halfling painters - this one of theirs?
   1075354|00000000||Uh, mhm.
   1075357|00000000||Wonderful. I put this up at the Rosemary and Thyme, it'll make those Temple Guard inspections so much easier.
   1075330|00000000||Want a portrait of Hierarch Hemmelfart?
   1061376|00000000||See you, Dandelion.
    356170|00000000||See you.
   1001677|00000000||Molly says hello.
   1001679|00000000||Ran into Molly. She says "hello."
   1001681|00000000||Molly? Which Molly?
   1001683|00000000||One you promised to show your butterfly collection to.
   1001723|00000000||Ah, yes… Now I remember.
   1001725|00000000||Butterfly collection? You of all people could stand to be a little more inventive.
   1001727|00000000||Molly didn't need inventive, she needed attentive. Average, run of the mill girl… but give her a smile, notice her shoes, let her chat about them a bit, and she'd turn into a wellspring of passion.
   1001162|00000000||Now, what's eating you?
    356412|00000000||Verbose drivel. Simple as that. Need to talk to you, Dandelion - in prose.
    356414|00000000||Ugh. Witchers - not an ounce of sensitivity.
    356380|00000000||Verbose.
    429105|00000000||Dandelion…
    356364|00000000||Around me thundered the noise of the street. In mourning, an image of majestic distress. With dainty fingers lifting the hem of her dress. A stately woman strode by with hurrying feet.
    429107|00000000||Ugh. Dandelion. Hey! Hear me?
    429109|00000000||Geralt, I'm writing, creating. Incidentally, what do you think of that bit?
    429305|00000000||Got a minute?
    429307|00000000||For you, my friend - always!
   1008857|00000000||Ha-hah, heh, heh, hello.
   1008851|00000000||Shit.
   1008849|00000000||Aaaah!
    532236|002e06b1||Bard
    499051|00000000||They say you're the best of the pickpockets. Would you mind demonstrating your dexterity?
    499052|00000000||I'm bound for the market square, love, if you'd like to come and watch.
    499053|00000000||Not what I had in mind. I was thinking of a bit of enjoyment before they burn me at the stake.
   1006934|00000000||Ugh!
   1006936|00000000||Get out of here!
   1006940|00000000||I don't like you. Stay away from here.
   1006944|00000000||That was you last warning.
    572070|00000000||Sod off, arsemunch.
    572072|00000000||What is it, grayboy? Lookin' for adventure?
    572076|00000000||Oy, cocker.
   1073185|00000000||All right. Let's.
    572074|00000000||Next up for a shave!
    572078|00000000||Hay-yah!
   1073179|00000000||Sheathe your sword, you cunt.
   1073181|00000000||You! Cunt!
   1073183|00000000||That's wise, grayboy.
   1030444|00000000||Word is there'll be a big tournament soon.
   1030446|00000000||Yeees… the city fathers'll do anything to distract folk from their true problems.
   1030448|00000000||I'm signing up. Stakes are going to be high, you could win a life changing fortune.
   1030450|00000000||All I know's that when they dangle a fortune to win before you, it's even easier to lose one.
    175958|00000000||You're my new instructor? Well, well, papa clearly went out of his way this time.
    418508|00000000||Wood to start with. I must know your worth.
    558692|00000000||Leave now. You're disrupting the ritual.
    562099|00000000||This is black magic, these folk disturb the dead. We cannot allow it, we will not.
    562103|00000000||You don't know a thing about their customs.
    558693|00000000||Take him! And disperse the others!
    558673|00000000||Leave them alone.
    558674|00000000||Here to fight monsters, not humans.
    558675|00000000||We've no quarrel with you. Begone.
    558676|00000000||Scatter this rabble to the four winds! Don't spare the whip!
    558672|00000000||Not my fight.
    558668|00000000||Abomination! Stop this at once!
    562004|00000000||The errant souls… we must help them…
    558669|00000000||Silence! I'll not tolerate necromancy!
    569163|00000000||Help me.
    558659|00000000||Begone, foul force! I cast upon you the light of the Eternal Fire!
    568277|00000000||I've come for you, patricide.
    568272|00000000||Should I drive him away?
    568274|00000000||Nay.
    568269|00000000||Should I drive him away?
    568270|00000000||Who are you?
    568276|00000000||Who are you?
    569158|00000000||He knows.
    437958|00000000||Hark! A sound I hear! 'Tis right? A spirit breaks the still of night!
    437960|00000000||Burn the incense ever higher! Spirit, join us 'round the fire!
    437969|00000000||Spirit - speak! This time is yours! Tell us of your ghostly woes!
    568268|00000000||Tis old man Ambros!
   1058230|00000000||All right. They're gone. Come on.
   1015555|0001853c||Dog
    588826|00000000||March back in there!
    588828|00000000||But, commander! It's full of monsters and traps!
    588830|00000000||We've dragged out four wounded, and there's near a dozen corpses still down there!
    588832|00000000||I don't give a shit! We've orders to search this cave and that's what we'll do!
   1054331|00000000||Killin' monsters, it's like butterin' bread to you…
    562533|00000000||Oh, Allgod. Help a poor wretch in need. Pretty please.
    562535|00000000||How dare you disturb my divine rest, mortal?!
    562536|00000000||I dare disturb it 'cause I want your divine self to lift the, uh, curse you cast. Those peasants really don't have--
    562537|00000000||They must bring worthy offerings, or they shall face drought! Driving hail! Earthquakes! Avalanches! I have spoken!
    562538|00000000||Avalanches? Here? Huh, how would that work?
    562539|00000000||No answer from the Allgod… Fine, we can finish our conversation when I find him. Voice came from underground…
    473280|00000000||What're you starin' at? Get outta here, damned clots!
    473282|00000000||Wh-heeey! Come now! Who'll drink with me?!
    473708|00000000||Where the fuck is everybody?!
    473286|00000000||Now listen - this is how it was!
    473612|00000000||They told us not to shoot. I scaled the wall and gazed down on the fields to see two hundred ballistas thundering!
    473288|00000000||Not one fuckin' man here who knows how to celebrate!
    476053|00000000||Blargh. Just deserve, you ploughin' scumbags!
    476079|00000000||I know you're in there! Ugh, brgh!
    476085|00000000||Urgh. Open up, or I'll kill those brats of yours!
    477295|00000000||Ardal!
    477297|00000000||Where is Ardal?!
   1068762|00000000||Good to see you again, master.
   1071608|00000000||Hey there.
   1071610|00000000||Lookin' for somethin' unusual, are you?
   1068760|00000000||Well, who do we have here…? I'm cursed, is that why you've come? Gonna lift it with a kiss?
   1068768|00000000||You available?
   1071592|00000000||Mhm.
   1068756|00000000||Let's have some fun.
   1068770|00000000||Not this time, thanks.
   1068758|00000000||Take care.
   1068757|00000000||Been working here long?
   1068766|00000000||Tell me about yourself.
   1071616|00000000||Why would I?
   1071618|00000000||I'm interested, curious.
   1071620|00000000||I'd rather not.
   1068764|00000000||Remember me?
   1071612|00000000||Course I do.
   1071614|00000000||So?
   1036614|00000000||Statuette of a man. Wasn't carved, but produced using magic. Oughta ask Triss about it.
   1075702|00000000||Statuette of a man. Wasn't carved, but produced using magic. Shame I can't ask Triss about it.
    175243|4b55b34b||Marquise Serenity
    301032|5a979acb||Wild Hunt Warrior
    591132|00000000||Don't like folk wanderin' around here.
    591136|00000000||Oh, yeah? Well, got a beast you need someone to get rid of? I'm here about the notice.
    591137|00000000||Mh. Supervisor Lund posted it. Yeah, a beast haunts the outskirts, murderin' folk. Got 'em scared to leave their homes after dusk.
   1004276|00000000||Can I talk to this supervisor?
   1004282|00000000||Like to talk to this supervisor.
   1004284|00000000||Too bad he don't receive petitioners.
   1034839|00000000||So what's he do, exactly?
   1034841|00000000||Delivers relief on behalf of the city council - flour and groats for the paupers. Meanin', he don't do it personally. He's got men for that. He himself, he, uh…
   1004286|00000000||Supervises.
   1004288|00000000||Exactly.
   1004275|00000000||Maybe I can hunt this beast down.
   1004278|00000000||I aim to hunt down this monster.
   1004280|00000000||Best hurry, then. Some other bloke's already after it.
    591179|00000000||When'd you find the last victim?
    591180|00000000||Just last night. Hubert, a beggar, but a decent man. I'd let him sleep in the shed from time to time - that one, on the right.
    591182|00000000||Eustace hasn't come for the corpse yet. It's lyin' in there, where I found it.
    591138|00000000||Where'd the beast last attack?
    591185|00000000||Who took the contract?
    591186|00000000||Didn't see the man. Was just told some brave fool'd turned up.
    591140|00000000||Someone's taken the contract? Who?
   1004290|00000000||Thanks. So long.
    591141|00000000||So long.
    591139|00000000||Anyone see this monster?
    591183|00000000||Any eye-witnesses to these attacks?
    591184|00000000||No, just the bodies.
   1005290|00000000||Beast appears only at night, chooses isolated victims.
    591133|00000000||You're back.
    417729|00000000||Last I came through here I still hoped Anabelle and me would…
    450621|00000000||It weren't impossible! We could've been together! And now…
    453541|00000000||She's dead! And it's my fault! If only I'd been able to protect her!
    417731|00000000||Can't change the past, but you can still help Anabelle, to move on, to rest in peace.
    466374|60bed45d||Eternal Fire Priest
    466828|00000000||It's the whoreson gave our lads a lickin'! Grab 'im, beat 'im till he shits a rainbow!
    371547|00000000||Hey! White-hair!
    416603|00000000||Be sure and tell us when the rammy's due to start, eh?
    371561|00000000||Cleaver send you?
    371563|00000000||Aye, he did. Awaitin' your word.
    371569|00000000||Not just yet.
    371571|00000000||You're in charge.
    371555|00000000||Stay here.
    371553|00000000||Let's go.
    371557|00000000||Let's go. Time's a-wasting.
    371559|00000000||You heard him! We're goin' in!
    447330|00000000||Well, well... Ain't often you get such a lovely thrashin', eh, Hal?
    449275|00000000||Man's speechless, but I can see it on his mug. Bugger likes you.
    449277|00000000||Time we got some rest - we'll guard whatever you want.
    449279|00000000||For free, eh, Hal?
    449408|00000000||Your coin - have it back. And don't fret, we'll get there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
    447354|00000000||Fought well, white one.
    449281|00000000||Hal liked you. Can see it in his smile.
    449283|00000000||We've time for a little rest, then we'll guard whatever it is you want. Don't fret, we'll get there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
    449416|00000000||And we'll keep that coin, right Hal?
    449430|00000000||Double your wages. As promised.
    449432|00000000||But if I win, I get it back.
    449434|00000000||Hal! Finish 'im! Got somethin' special lined up!
    449426|00000000||Here - double your usual take.
    449404|00000000||Need to think about it.
    447344|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    447348|00000000||Gotta think about it.
    447350|00000000||Go and think. Much as you want.
    449428|00000000||Changed my mind.
    447346|00000000||Fine. Fight you both.
    449410|00000000||Cough up the coin first. Lose, and it stays with us.
    447342|00000000||Agreed. Fight you both.
    447358|00000000||Rather pay you.
    447360|00000000||Not in the mood for a fight. Can't I just pay you?
    447362|00000000||How it always is with you ploughin' Nordlings.
    449418|00000000||Hal! Finish up, will you? We're gonna take in some high culture!
    449420|00000000||I'd never agree to this shite, normally. But must say I'm curious why a mutant's hirin' two boys from Metinna to keep the peace at a performance in Novigrad.
    449422|00000000||Give us the coin.
    449424|00000000||Hal! For fuck's sake, finish the bugger already! We're going!
   1065896|00000000||We'll be there before any of the dancin' starts.
    447321|00000000||I'll pay you well. Stand to make more than you do here.
    449327|00000000||Expecting trouble? Will we need to bust some heads?
    449329|00000000||Can't rule it out. Bricks could start flying - heard that from a reliable source.
    447323|00000000||Hal! Wanna smash some bricklayers?
    449331|00000000||Oh, he does, he does! Or I don't know me own brother.
    449406|00000000||Gimme that coin. And don't fret, we'll be there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
    447317|00000000||I'll pay you.
    447319|00000000||What if I fight you and win?
    447325|00000000||How about a wager? If I beat Hal, you'll come work for me - gratis.
    449333|00000000||Hmmm, see, Hal's no fan of mummings. Failed romance, spare you the details.
    449335|00000000||You'll need somethin' special to convince him. Here's an idea: take us both on, same time. Fight of the century - a witcher 'gainst the two-headed dragon of Metinna!
    449337|00000000||What if I lose?
    447327|00000000||Oh, you'll lose. But we'll still do your little job. You'll just pay us double.
    449414|00000000||Made up your mind? Willin' to take part in the fight of the century?
   1048638|00000000||Unless you've already found your, uh, ushers, for, uh… whatsit.
    447309|00000000||Good fight. Some nice footwork there.
    447311|00000000||Challenging me or is it Hal you wanna face?
    449224|00000000||A witcher versus the Beast of Metinna! Killer instinct versus primal rage!
    449228|00000000||You from Nilfgaard?
    449230|00000000||You guys really from Nilfgaard?
    449232|00000000||We's from ploughin' Metinna, dammit. Not Nilfgaard.
    449234|00000000||Raised by wild hounds on the windswept plains of Mag Deira! Brothers forged in bloodshed, veterans of Metinna's infamous, filthy arenas!
    449236|00000000||Who dares face the wild men of the South?! Who will look the beasts in the eye?
    449226|00000000||Got a job for you. As ushers.
    449285|00000000||Like to hire you to help out. We're staging a play.
    449287|00000000||Need us to kick some arse on stage?
    449289|00000000||Actually want you to usher, keep the peace, make sure no one's ass gets kicked - on stage or off.
    449291|00000000||Got the wrong men. Arse-kicking's what we do.
    532410|00529204||Poor Townswoman
    529682|00000000||Can't afford me.
    529687|00000000||You can't afford me.
    529688|00000000||Ah, amusing. The matter that brings me here happens to be very profitable. So, if it's merely a question of coin, I'm sure we will reach an agreement.
    529689|00000000||Agreed. I'll be right behind you.
    529690|00000000||Keep your hand on your hilt. As a general matter of precaution, of course.
    529691|00000000||Of course. Always do that when I'm out for a stroll.
    529649|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
    529693|00000000||Think you can handle this on your own. Nobody pays for company during a normal stroll, and if they do, I'm just not up for that sort of thing.
    529694|00000000||Strange lack of pragmatism for a witcher. You've passed up a marvelous opportunity to earn a considerable sum.
    544420|00000000||Farewell.
    529650|00000000||Rather not get involved.
    529684|00000000||What's involved? Just to be clear, I'm neither a bodyguard nor an assassin for hire.
    529685|00000000||Now what makes you think I need either of those? I'd simply ask you to accompany me on a stroll. Should anything happen along the way, well… perhaps then you might need to do some work for your pay.
    531514|00000000||What say you to that?
    529681|00000000||What do you have in mind?
    529676|00000000||Thank you for your help. That's the only way to deal with this rabble. They beg for trouble.
    529677|00000000||And you're begging for trouble, just coming here at this hour. Especially dressed like that.
    529678|00000000||I've come on business.
    529679|00000000||Good luck with that.
    529680|00000000||Wait… You helped me once, perhaps you'd be willing to do it again. For more than a kind word this time.
   1055685|971ea264||Simulacrum
    430495|00000000||A brazier… This time of year?
    430497|00000000||Human. Priscilla's?
    430499|00000000||I know that smell. Formaldehyde.
    430522|00000000||Man's footprint. The murderer's, maybe. Weight on his heel… Took a step back.
    439129|00000000||Murderer fled before the guards arrived. Ran this way…
    439131|00000000||Trail ends here. Strange. Even I couldn't jump this wall.
    456838|00000000||Another empty formaldehyde bottle.
    440100|00000000||Tracks just end… As if he… vanished.
    448274|00000000||Not this way… Fled by the other door.
   1054979|00000000||Same wounds as the previous victims… Examination would be a waste of time. Gotta get to Crippled Kate's. Fast.
   1009976|00000000||A real cloudburst.
   1009974|00000000||Welcome.
   1009972|00000000||Welcome.
   1009970|00000000||Greetings.
   1009968|00000000||A d'yaebl aep arse!
   1009966|00000000||Leg it! Save yourselves!
   1064799|00000000||All right?
   1064801|00000000||Mhm. Thanks for your help.
   1067322|00000000||Plan's gone to hell… So be it, we'll improvise. Follow me, Geralt! We must get to Radovid before reinforcements arrive!
    433837|00000000||Unbind me! 'Fore the next ones come!
    433847|00000000||Fine. I'll help.
    433849|00000000||Phew, thanks. For a minute there, was almost sure you'd leave me to die.
    467606|00000000||Like to thank you somehow… But I've not a chipped crown to my name.
    467646|00000000||Tough. I'll take the loss.
    467648|00000000||Thanks, witcher. May you prosper on the Path!
    433823|00000000||I'll untie you.
    433851|00000000||Sorry, can't help you.
    433853|00000000||What? Why not?
    467584|00000000||Find it hard to believe the folks from the camp left you here just 'cause you're a deserter.
    467588|00000000||All right, mighta been other factors involved! But is that any reason to leave me to a certain death?
    467590|00000000||Not that certain… You could wiggle free. Just keep quiet… drowners might not notice you.
    433825|00000000||I won't help you.
    433839|00000000||When they come, I'll tend to them. Meanwhile… let's you and me chat. Like to know who I'm untying.
    433845|00000000||John Verdun. Served in the 10th Maribor Division…
    544732|00000000||Long way from your army.
    467569|00000000||Me army don't exist no more. Black Ones smashed it to bits… I scarpered off into the woods just 'fore that happened.
    544734|00000000||Joined a group of refugees… Fuckin' burstin' with patriotism, they were. Soon as they learned I'd abandoned Temeria in her hour of need, they beat me down, tied me up like a turkey, left me to the drowners.
    432576|00000000||But milady, he's a witcher! Said so himself, back by the gates!
    432578|00000000||Captain, do you truly believe Rosa var Attre would train with random clods calling themselves swordmasters? No, the var Attres demand the very best. Thus, we've hired a witcher.
    432617|00000000||Take him to the training room. Now.
    432619|00000000||As you say, miss.
    432572|00000000||But miss, he just claimed to be the cook! He's a cheat, he is!
    432574|00000000||Hahah, see, Frederic? Did I not warn you not to jest with the guards? They haven't any sense of humor whatever.
    432613|00000000||Now take Master de Bergerac to the training room. Quickly.
    175850|00000000||Who are you? Why are you here? Answer this instant or I'll summon the guards!
    175852|00000000||Uh, sorry to sneak in, miss. I'm Geralt, a friend of the bard Dandelion…
    182766|00000000||Geralt of Rivia? The famed witcher of the ballads?
    175854|00000000||What're you doing here, vagrant?! How'd you get in?! I let no one in the front, milady, I swear it on the Great Sun!
    358515|00000000||Not a word. I'll handle this.
    175856|00000000||Hold your tongue, sir. This... This is Frederic Francis de Bergerac. My new swordplay instructor, correct? Show him to the training room. I shall join him shortly.
   1055671|c2913359||Armored Arachas
    423059|00000000||Greetings. What've you got to pawn, and how much d'you need?
    423061|00000000||What makes you think I need a loan?
    423063|00000000||Tain't a man that don't, from time to time. And you don't look nor smell flush with coin.
    423065|00000000||Just so happens I'm doing fine at the moment.
    423067|00000000||Then maybe you'd like a look at what the less fortunate have forfeited?
    423045|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    423031|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1028765|00000000||What would you say to a few rounds of gwent?
   1028764|00000000||How about a game of cards?
    423047|00000000||So long.
    423033|00000000||Farewell.
    423043|00000000||You come across as quite the experienced loan shark.
    423071|00000000||Been a loan shark long?
    423073|00000000||Aye, since I was just a little tyke!
    425303|00000000||So you helped your dad? Took it over when he died?
    425305|00000000||Nah, me own father left me here in pawn, and never did redeem me.
    423069|00000000||Hello there. Pawnin' or buyin'?
    421007|00000000||Fancy a gander at our little stockpile?
    497380|00000000||We've assembled quite the collection - made no sense to let such nice things waste away in peasant huts…
   1028746|00000000||Wouldn't mind a few rounds of gwent.
   1028745|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    421015|00000000||See ya.
    421011|00000000||Farewell.
    421009|00000000||What're you offering?
    421013|00000000||Show me what you got.
    430559|00000000||I trained her at Kaer Morhen…
    430579|00000000||Ciri was orphaned. During the second war with Nilfgaard.
    430581|00000000||Had no idea what to do with a young girl, so I did what I would've done with a boy and took her to Kaer Morhen. Figured some physical training, sword work, development of her stamina - couldn't hurt.
    430583|00000000||I remember her standing on a crumbling wall. A stone came loose, she lost her footing… Caught her at the last possible instant.
    430585|00000000||Strongest memory, though, is of her coming out of her room one day, wearing a dress and claiming she was indisposed.
    430587|00000000||Knew then that Ciri was maturing, it was unavoidable. I was lost in the face of that.
    430561|00000000||Saved her life once.
    430596|00000000||It was after her time training at Kaer Morhen. After the moment when Yennefer first called Ciri her daughter.
    430598|00000000||We'd been separated. I knew she was in danger - I'd dreamt of her, multiple times.
    430600|00000000||I found her at Stygga Castle. She'd gone there to free Yen and gotten herself captured in the process.
    430602|00000000||They wanted to hurt her.
    430604|00000000||I remember fighting side by side with Ciri on stairs slippery from blood.
    430606|00000000||It was the first time she ever deflected a crossbow bolt with her sword. Told her never to try it again.
   1060931|00000000||These memories, they're intense. Do you wish to continue?
   1060945|00000000||I have more to say.
   1060947|00000000||Then please do.
   1060936|00000000||I have more to say.
   1060937|00000000||Let's move on.
    430563|00000000||She was there when I died.
    430608|00000000||It was in Rivia. The second war with Nilfgaard had just ended.
    430610|00000000||There was still tension in the air. For gods know what reason, race riots erupted in the town.
    430612|00000000||I tried to do something, but… Couldn't stop a riled crowd.
    430614|00000000||A boy with a pitchfork. He ran it right through my gut. Yennefer lay dying as well…
    430616|00000000||Ciri had us carried onto a boat… We sailed to a place where apple trees bloom eternal. She left us there.
    430618|00000000||It was the last time I saw her.
   1060933|00000000||Is there anything you'd like to add? Another memory, perhaps?
   1060949|00000000||Yes… There's something else…
   1060951|00000000||All right. Tell me no more than you wish to.
   1060938|00000000||Yes.
   1060939|00000000||No.
    430669|00000000||No.
    430849|00000000||No.
    430855|00000000||No. Can we start?
    430857|00000000||Naturally.
    430859|00000000||I knew you cared about her. But your tone, the emotions you so carefully conceal…
    430861|00000000||Let's continue, please?
   1061166|00000000||Yennefer and Triss.
    493704|00000000||Yennefer wasn't in Novigrad…
    493710|00000000||Triss was, but Ciri never found her…
    432046|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    432048|00000000||Good luck, witcher. I hope you find your Ciri.
    525457|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    525458|00000000||The Rosemary and Thyme? That an inn?
    493725|00000000||The Rosemary and Thyme? Where's that?
    493727|00000000||As you enter the city through the red light district, you come upon a bridge. The Rosemary is just past it.
    525454|00000000||Dandelion inherited a brothel?
    525456|00000000||So I've heard.
    432030|00000000||Ugh. Dreamt of a swallow at first… After that, just nightmares.
    432032|00000000||At times the dreams can multiply. Show the past as well as the future.
    367410|00000000||The swallow - it symbolizes Ciri. She contacted Dandelion. I didn't know he was in town…
    525452|00000000||The poet? Heard about him. Someone left him the Rosemary and Thyme in their will.
   1061168|00000000||Maybe Dandelion? They liked each other a lot…
   1061165|00000000||Dandelion.
    362614|00000000||Make yourself comfortable and try to relax.
    418321|00000000||You must take my hand and talk of Ciri. Tell me where you think she might be, who could be at her side.
   1061164|00000000||Mhm… If Ciri couldn't find me, I'm sure she would've looked for another friend.
   1061171|00000000||Who do you mean?
   1086385|00000000||Let's move on.
    430823|00000000||They call Ciri the Lady of Space and Time. Once I asked Yennefer why.
    430825|00000000||She… travels between worlds… Hm, turns out I don't know how to talk about it.
    430827|00000000||Didn't really understand much of what Yen told me.
    430829|00000000||I just know there's more to it than traveling to different places.
    432068|00000000||And that Ciri carries immense power in her blood.
    430819|00000000||They call her the Lady of Space and Time.
    430841|00000000||I remember Ciri having trouble controlling her abilities.
    430843|00000000||Yennefer tried to teach her to cast simple spells, and Ciri destroyed a shed near the temple where they were. Really upset her, but it was just an old shed.
    430845|00000000||I know it took her a while to gain control. And frankly, I doubt she controls her abilities fully to this day.
    430821|00000000||She had trouble controlling them.
    430817|00000000||Ciri is a child of the Elder Blood.
    430831|00000000||She's a child of the Elder Blood.
    430833|00000000||A descendent of Bloody Falka? The rebel burned at the stake?
    430835|00000000||The prophecies claim the world's destroyer will be born of the firebrand's cursed blood.
    430837|00000000||Pure legend.
    430839|00000000||Know when a legend transforms into prophecy? When it gains believers. I think you're right to be reticent in talking about the woman.
    430851|00000000||I see. Do you wish to say more?
    430847|00000000||Yes.
    430853|00000000||Yeah, there's something else.
    430675|00000000||No. Let's continue.
    430815|00000000||You claim the woman has… abilities. Tell me about them.
   1060935|00000000||No.
   1060941|00000000||Yes… I think so.
   1060943|00000000||In that case, I'm listening.
   1060934|00000000||Yes.
   1060929|00000000||I see… Do you wish to tell me anything more?
   1086298|00000000||That's everything.
    430557|00000000||I remember when we first met.
    430565|00000000||I accepted a job once, did it. Asked to choose my reward, I invoked the Law of Surprise.
    430567|00000000||Never thought I'd actually meet the child promised to me at that time.
    430569|00000000||Years later I was in the Brokilon Forest. Happened on a girl there. Didn't know who she was.
    430571|00000000||The dryads wanted to keep her, turn her into one of their own. But the Waters of Oblivion - they failed in her case.
    430573|00000000||Ciri came out of Brokilon with me. I sent her back to her grandmother then… But already I felt bound to her…
    430575|00000000||By Destiny?
    430577|00000000||By something more.
    430663|00000000||Thank you.
    430665|00000000||Would you be willing to share another memory?
    430667|00000000||Yes.
    430671|00000000||Yes.
    430673|00000000||No need to rush. We have time.
    362339|00000000||To start with, tell me a memory you have of this woman.
    430553|00000000||What for?
    430555|00000000||Do as I ask, please. I need the strongest, most complete memory you have of…
    430594|00000000||Ciri. The woman's name is Ciri.
    430485|00000000||Let's begin.
    430481|00000000||Let's do this.
    430483|00000000||Dreaming - what's it about?
    430467|00000000||Your gift - tell me how it works?
    430469|00000000||It's hard to describe… To start with, I must gain an understanding of the bond between the person and the object I'm to dream about.
    430471|00000000||I ask questions, try to flesh out feelings, emotions… Truth is essential in this, and though most who come to me acknowledge that, many refuse to speak openly of certain matters. Apart from which they remain unaware of others, further obscuring things.
    430473|00000000||What do you see in your dreams?
    430475|00000000||I don't. It's my client who sees. My gift lies in summoning the right dreams.
    430477|00000000||At times, nightmares or strong desires impose themselves on true events. It takes skill to separate seed from chaff.
    362292|00000000||I dream in here.
    418249|00000000||Never witnessed a séance like this before. Let alone participated.
    418251|00000000||I will guide you. We must first achieve a kind of mental accord: I must ask some questions, you must answer them. It's important you're truthful, answer from your heart.
    381440|00000000||Speak, please…
    178103|00000000||Must've been attacked by a powerful beast. Surprised 'em. Hope they got away.
    178079|00000000||Let's summarize.
    178081|00000000||Bones have been here a while.
    178067|00000000||Bones.
    178097|00000000||Giant claws. Wasn't a necrophage made these marks.
    178071|00000000||Ribs.
    178099|00000000||Horseshoe's missing. Is this the animal that lost one in the smokehouse?
    178073|00000000||Legs.
    178101|00000000||Head torn clear off. Takes incredible strength.
    178075|00000000||Head.
    178069|00000000||Saddle.
    178083|00000000||Chewed on the saddle? Necrophages'll eat anything these days.
    179283|00000000||What do we have here…?
    393988|00000000||Hmm, trail goes on. Good thing it doesn't end here.
   1053013|00000000||Gooseberry's sour this year.
   1053015|00000000||It's 'cause there's not been much sun.
   1053017|00000000||Aye. Each winter's harsher than the last, every spring's cooler… Maybe it's true - the White Frost is comin'.
   1053019|00000000||It's always been comin' and just… never arrives. Black Ones, though, they've come. Sittin' right across the river. War's the real worry, not prophecies.
   1003713|00000000||Think I know what happened here. Priscilla fought back, her assailant retreated - and knocked over the brazier.
   1003715|00000000||Someone must've heard it, maybe saw something, started hollering - guards showed up. Murderer didn't finish the job, didn't cover his tracks. Just collected himself and leapt over the wall. Trail ends there.
   1003726|00000000||You divined all this from a pile o' rubbish and a few prints in the mud?
   1003728|00000000||Do that practically every day in my profession. And practice makes perfect.
   1003730|00000000||True enough. Just like I can tell right off if a punter'll pay or try to wriggle out of it.
   1003732|00000000||That particular skill I could use myself.
    455123|00000000||Think I know what happened here.
    449772|00000000||Priscilla wasn't the sole victim - you aware of that?
    449774|00000000||Oh, dearie… 'Course I was.
    572389|00000000||This didn't start yesterday. Others've died like this before. Beggars, street girls, orphans. But who'd have a dram of concern about them? Human rubbish. It's what the guards call us.
   1003688|00000000||Recall any names?
   1003690|00000000||They didn't have proper ones. "Baldy," "Curly," "Buns" - that's what folk called 'em. No friends, no families. Their bodies were burned long ago.
    449760|00000000||Priscilla wasn't the sole victim. Know that, don't you?
   1003692|00000000||I gotta look around some more. Appreciate it if you didn't disturb me.
   1003694|00000000||Naturally. We'll stand aside, behave. But… do tell us if you find anythin' else here.
   1003696|00000000||And I got a murderer to catch.
   1003698|00000000||Take care now.
    449766|00000000||Farewell.
    449758|00000000||You and Priscilla friends?
    449768|00000000||You and Priscilla friends?
    572381|00000000||Friends? Nah. But she saw more than a stupid whore in me, treated me with respect. It mattered.
    572385|00000000||I was lookin' to give up whorin', pick up a decent trade. But none would take me - not as a washerwoman, nor a servant, nor a cook. Felt like a leper, I did. But Priscilla… she was different.
    449770|00000000||Agreed to put me in her play, you see. Lots of the other actors, they were afraid on account of her jestin' 'bout the Eternal Fire. Whistling Wendy on stage - can you imagine it? Well, dream's gone now. I'm back to workin' street corners.
   1003684|00000000||Sorry to hear that.
   1003686|00000000||You could do worse as work goes. Or so I tell myself.
    449794|00000000||So? What is it?
    449740|00000000||Think you'll gut me too, eh? Up your arse, deviant! Whores can fight back! Argh!
    449742|00000000||Calm down, I'm not gonna hurt you. What're you doing here?
    449750|00000000||Gettin' vengeance! Well, why you starin'? Have you not heard killers always return to the scene of their crime? Me and my brothers are waitin' here to give him a warm welcome. For Priscilla. Almost did her in, the whoreson!
    449756|00000000||I know. Here to look for clues, and find anyone who might know something.
    572379|00000000||Fear I can't help you much. But I can tell you what I know.
    447522|00000000||Grab 'im!
    455127|00000000||Hey handsome…
    455129|00000000||That's him! Follow me, lads!
    455654|00000000||How am I to know? Watch 'im - see what he does.
   1032442|00000000||It's uneven 'ere. Bush is half a finger taller on the left than on the right.
   1032444|00000000||Ehh, who's gonna notice…?
   1032446|00000000||Lady Ingrid. She's throwin' a ball - haven't you heard? With all the great lords and ladies of Novigrad attendin'?
   1032448|00000000||Garden's gotta be perfect as a paintin', she's insisted! So grab some shears and even it out!
    472444|00000000||Couldn't find your mare. Must really be a woodland spook running around.
    472446|00000000||Is there now't we can do?
    478388|00000000||No. And in general, don't venture too deep into the woods. You never know what a spook'll do.
    472431|00000000||Couldn't find your horse.
    472457|00000000||Aye, I'd recognize her anywhere.
    473706|00000000||C'mon, Jumper, you've got some explaining to do. Where'd ye wonder off to, anyway?
    473728|00000000||And here's yours, sir, as agreed.
    473734|00000000||Thanks. So long.
    472455|00000000||Nay, not at all! She were gray, I told ye. And twice as old, legs as crooked as me dead wife's.
    473724|00000000||Suppose I got to pay you more for this young 'un. But, oh well.
    473726|00000000||Thanks. So long.
    472450|00000000||This your mare?
    472442|00000000||Is this your horse?
    472435|00000000||Farewell.
    472433|00000000||Farewell.
    472429|00000000||What say you, sir?
    169537|00000000||Keira Metz deep in the heart of Velen… Thought you hated the countryside.
    355488|00000000||I can assure you I do, now more than ever.
    355492|00000000||Heard a witch lived out here. Never would've guessed it was King Foltest's former advisor.
    414089|00000000||I'm so pleased the world's still able to astound you, Geralt. I actually envy you that sense of wonder - common in children, knights errant, and morons.
    475115|00000000||Hm, someone's grown irritable. Is that any way to greet an old friend?
    475117|00000000||I believe I "greeted you" with a pleasant view. Now tell me what brings you here.
    413676|00000000||Missed a spot.
    413679|00000000||Where?
    413682|00000000||Hope you didn't come to gawk.
    413684|00000000||No. To talk.
    413686|00000000||Turn around and wait.
    593567|00000000||Geralt! Just when I was starting to miss you!
    475391|00000000||Any word from the other sorceresses of the Lodge?
    475536|00000000||Any news of your sisters from the Lodge?
    475546|00000000||None. We can't know too much about one another these days. It's safer that way.
    475548|00000000||Even tried to contact one another?
    475550|00000000||I've wanted to many times. But I've no way of knowing who would answer - or who might be listening.
    475121|00000000||Why Velen?
    413748|00000000||Picked a strange place to hide.
    413750|00000000||I didn't pick anything. In the North, Radovid's men hunt sorceresses like fish in a barrel. Nilfgaard controls the south. Where was I to flee?
    413752|00000000||Emperor does keep mages on a short leash, but he lets them live and ply their trade.
    413754|00000000||Radovid and Emhyr differ in every respect except one: They share a deep hatred of the Lodge of Sorceresses. And I was a member.
    475276|00000000||Like playing the village witch?
    475562|00000000||So how's it feel to be the village witch?
    475564|00000000||Huh. Horrid.
    475568|00000000||No joy in having the boundless respect and trust of the local peasantry?
    475570|00000000||They'd respect anyone who could produce hemorrhoid cream.
    475572|00000000||Been here a while, haven't you?
    475574|00000000||Long enough for rot to set in. You cannot possibly imagine how much I detest this place.
    475389|00000000||What are you doing in Velen?
    414105|00000000||So, betcha saw this question coming: what are you doing here?
    414107|00000000||Let me think… Enjoying the country air? Admiring the unspoilt scenery? Or is it furthering the age-old alliance between the city and its breadbasket. No.
    414109|00000000||I'm in hiding, Geralt. Blind to the state of the world? Don't you see what's happening?
    414562|00000000||Mean the persecution mages now face?
    414564|00000000||Yes, that's exactly what I mean - Radovid's new pastime, pursuing anyone with a whiff of magic about them.
    414566|00000000||Witch hunters - sound familiar? Murderers scouring the North from end to end. Burning books, hanging soothsayers, torturing herbalists…
    475129|00000000||Back to the topic at hand.
    496582|00000000||Changing the subject…
    414987|00000000||See you, Keira.
    418925|00000000||See you.
    413862|00000000||Looking for a certain young woman.
    410989|00000000||I'm looking for a certain young woman.
    410991|00000000||Oh really. Who?
    410985|00000000||I'm looking for Ciri. That Ciri. And no one can know. Understand?
    413856|00000000||Cirilla is here? The girl once sought by the Lodge of Sorceresses and practically every ruler on the Continent has landed here, in Velen, and I know nothing of it? What is she doing here?
    413858|00000000||Indications are she's hiding from someone. I heard she quarreled with a witch, but if you don't know anything…
   1002711|00000000||Sure you haven't seen her?
    411017|00000000||Ciri.
    411019|00000000||Someone who quarreled with a witch.
    411013|00000000||Apparently, she quarreled with the local witch.
    411015|00000000||Pff. Someone's been feeding you horseshit. The girls around here are too stupid to quarrel with me.
    477033|00000000||She's not from here.
    477035|00000000||You're up to something, Geralt. If I'm to help you, you must tell me what's going on. Who are you looking for?
    477037|00000000||Ciri.
    477039|00000000||Ciri? Well… now I understand the secrecy, not to mention the brooding, the furled brow. And you say she had some sort of problem with a witch?
    477041|00000000||So you haven't seen her.
    477043|00000000||I'm certain I haven't. But recently someone asked me about an ashen-haired woman. He claimed she would stand out from the peasant crowd.
    410961|00000000||My gratitude good enough?
    414787|00000000||My undying gratitude. Good enough?
    475274|00000000||It's nothing to sneeze at, but you've a knack for getting into trouble. I should probably ask for something more immediately deliverable.
    410997|00000000||Can't go just yet.
    410935|00000000||Can't go just yet.
    410937|00000000||In that case we'll meet there. I'll await you near the cave entrance.
    477319|00000000||Let's go, then.
    477321|00000000||Yes, let's.
    410995|00000000||Can we go?
    592251|00000000||He leave any message for her?
    592330|00000000||No, but he asked that were I to meet her, I should lead her to him.
    592333|00000000||So you know where to find him?
    592337|00000000||Yes, he said he'd found a hideout in some elven ruins near the village of Midcopse. I'll go there with you.
    592362|00000000||Why? Think I'll have trouble finding this place?
    592364|00000000||I've unfinished business with this elf. He promised me something, but he never delivered it.
    592366|00000000||Besides, I know you think as I do - that she might be there. And I'd like to see Cirilla, too.
    592318|00000000||He leave any message for her?
    410999|00000000||What was an elven mage doing in Velen?
    411001|00000000||Well, I tried to ask him, of course, about everything…
    592270|00000000||Of course.
    592272|00000000||But you know how elves are - he asked many more questions than he answered.
    413891|00000000||What was he doing in Velen?
    413887|00000000||What was his name?
    592217|00000000||He say what his name was?
    592219|00000000||He didn't. And he wore a mask. Very secretive all around, but… I liked him. He was intelligent and composed.
    592249|00000000||He say what he wanted with Ciri?
    592253|00000000||Only that they were to meet in Velen. He wished to know if she'd arrived before he did.
    413946|00000000||Ciri visited Skellige earlier. She was travelling with a mage… This elf, most probably.
    413948|00000000||The girl crossed half the world to get here… Care to tell me what this is about?
    413950|00000000||Wish I knew.
    475350|00000000||Oh, sod it, don't give me that look. I know it's Ciri we're talking about.
    592176|00000000||It was an elf - this individual who asked about Cirilla. No flea-bitten Scoia'tael slob, either, but an elven mage.
    414785|00000000||What's your rate these days? A couple dozen eggs? Three hens, maybe?
    475183|00000000||My rate rises with every word you speak. I'm not sure you can afford the information anymore.
    475272|00000000||Hm, you're pricklier than I remembered. Isn't living in nature's lap supposed to be cleansing, calming…?
    475332|00000000||Nature stinks.
    410959|00000000||How's a few dozen eggs sound?
    477085|00000000||Not so fast, Geralt. No humble plea? No offering for the witch?
    477078|00000000||He say anything else about her?
    477074|00000000||What else did he say?
    477073|00000000||Who did the asking?
    477076|00000000||Who was it?
    521566|00000000||Why'd you want a magic lamp?
    521569|00000000||Why'd you want the lamp?
    521571|00000000||You just witnessed why. To communicate with lost souls.
    521573|00000000||Didn't know you were interested in that kind of magic.
    521575|00000000||There's nothing wrong with it.
    521577|00000000||Mhm. Why'd the elf promise you the lamp?
    521579|00000000||We traded for it. He needed powerful magic and sensed I was no common wart charmer.
    521581|00000000||I brewed him a potion. To delay nervous tissue degeneration, stave off memory loss, or some such.
    521583|00000000||Who'd he want to use it on?
    521585|00000000||He didn't say…
    521567|00000000||Mage from the isle - tell me about him.
    521587|00000000||Tell me more about this mage from the isle. Were you two… close?
    521589|00000000||Never expected you'd take such an interest in my private life.
    521591|00000000||More interested to know if you bonded, as fellow magic practitioners.
    521593|00000000||Well, we had little in common in that arena. Alexander was one of those anxious experimenters, forever short on sleep. The kind that thinks perfect happiness is an isolated tower and a full set of vials and alembics.
   1003238|00000000||Are you and Lambert…?
   1003240|00000000||Are you and Lambert…?
   1003242|00000000||Did you think yourself the only witcher a sorceress could possibly take an interest in?
   1003244|00000000||You know, you two are actually a great match.
   1003246|00000000||You think so? Thank you.
    424663|00000000||I'd like to buy something from you.
    421164|00000000||Bet the old witch who lived here left you a bunch of interesting sundries.
    421166|00000000||She did indeed. I gather you'd like a look?
    475526|00000000||Very much so.
   1030531|00000000||Manage to find the lamp?
   1030535|00000000||Yes. And you? Come to ask my help again?
   1030547|00000000||No. But if there's anything I could do for you…
   1030555|00000000||Hmm…
   1030557|00000000||So there is something.
   1030580|00000000||Hmm… indeed. I do have this small favor to ask of you.
   1030516|00000000||Find the lamp?
   1030517|00000000||Hope you're not mad at me…
   1030532|00000000||Hope you're not mad at me…
   1030533|00000000||Oh, of course not. I understand perfectly well that you had valid, important reasons for leaving me in an underground cavern all by myself.
   1030468|00000000||Keira?
   1030470|00000000||What are you doing here?
   1030472|00000000||…but nay, the mage, he says, "Bring me rats! An' healthy ones! Not somethin' the cat dragged in."
   1030474|00000000||What's this? What's he saying about rats?
   1030476|00000000||It's no concern of yours.
    521667|00000000||Keira? What're you doing?
    521669|00000000||Geralt! You gave me quite a start!
    521671|00000000||…but nay, the mage, he says, "Bring me rats! An' healthy ones! Not somethin' the cat dragged in."
    521673|00000000||This the lamp from the elf's hideout? And what's this about rats?
    521676|00000000||Nothing important, I'll explain later. Now tell me - to what do I owe the pleasure?
    424525|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
   1015229|00000000||That went well. Really know the captain?
   1015241|00000000||Yes. A horrid man. Come now, get to work.
    583332|00000000||Uh, ne-next time you see the captain, m'lady, I'd, um, appreciate you mention…
    583333|00000000||That is all, good fellow. You may go. The witcher requires absolute silence while he works.
    583334|00000000||Oh. 'Course.
    358820|00000000||Fine grating… Couldn't push much through that.
    495483|00000000||Go away! Stupid wolves! Go!
    478624|00000000||Wolves!
    478629|00000000||Quick! Hide!
    478645|00000000||You can come out now!
    478646|00000000||My, you're brave. My father couldn't even do that!
    478647|00000000||Heh. Mine could do a lot more.
    486280|00000000||Come.
    478703|00000000||Hear that? Wolves.
    478704|00000000||Hide, quickly!
    478707|00000000||They're gone! You can come out!
    478708|00000000||You cut 'em up bad! The Wolf King will be angry.
    478712|00000000||Do parents often send their children out to follow the sweets?
    478713|00000000||Sometimes they send their children, sometimes they go themselves.
    486332|00000000||Do they return?
    486333|00000000||No, why would they? They've plenty to eat where the path ends.
    478739|00000000||Look, there! Lindenvale!
    478863|00000000||This way. Through the cave.
    478864|00000000||You lead.
    478873|00000000||It's a bit dark…
    478874|00000000||Afraid?
    486343|00000000||Are you?
    486345|00000000||No.
    496304|00000000||Then I'm not either.
   1086502|00000000||Look to me like a gwent aficionado.
    422120|00000000||So long.
    422116|00000000||Farewell.
    422114|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422118|00000000||What've you got there?
    426948|00000000||Unhand me, sir! I could be your daughter!
    427361|00000000||A role-play? I relish the thought!
    426950|00000000||I must steal a kiss, milady! You shall see! Just stand still and remove your mask!
    427363|00000000||You're drunk, sir! I shall tell your wife!
    427365|00000000||Do so. But first - a kiss!
    426942|00000000||And when I catch little Miss Clementine - what then, eh? What then?
    426944|00000000||I'll beat your mangy snout, that's what! Please, leave me be, sir!
    427359|00000000||Ooh-la-la, the little miss is a minx, she is, a minx!
    546068|00000000||What was that about?
    546071|00000000||What's become of me in me elder years? Refused a roof over me head by a common churl!
    593131|00000000||I was born a noble's daughter… My brother and I - we managed the manor for years.
   1075068|00000000||Here about the notice.
   1075070|00000000||And I thought none would come. Well, I'd a grange, a manor. Belonged to my family… myself and my brother - all gone now…
    596125|00000000||Been there.
    551693|00000000||Think I've been there. Don't need to worry about monsters anymore.
   1011150|00000000||Here, take this. It opens a chest. What's there is yours.
   1016582|00000000||I thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. I haven't the coin to reward you, but…
    551699|00000000||Also found a corpse - a man bricked up in a wall. Had these on him…
    551702|00000000||Humbert…
    551703|00000000||My brother, I thought he resented my choice, I thought he'd abandoned me… Yet it seems my husband killed him.
   1011148|00000000||Ehh, the truth is oft painful, but I thank you for revealing it. For this, and for driving off the beasts, I owe you a reward, but…
    593228|00000000||A roof over my head is all I need. And if it comes to it, I've other heirlooms to sell.
   1011145|00000000||But I know you witchers don't work for free. I could never let you go without honest pay. Gods keep you.
    551716|00000000||It's all right. Found the chest, too. But what'll you be left with?
    593226|00000000||What'll that leave you with?
    551695|00000000||I could take care of those monsters for you.
    551696|00000000||Hmm… You're a witcher, right? No ordinary man would be so eager.
    593219|00000000||Don't fret - it's all the same to me, provided you're honest.
    593220|00000000||The house, it's east of here. Take this key. Once you've driven off the beasts, look for a chest. My treasure, savings, really. They're yours.
    546069|00000000||The monsters in your house - I can kill them.
    546070|00000000||Farewell.
    593170|00000000||What happened to him?
    593174|00000000||A caller came one day, a drifter, a hunter… Ehh, it wasn't long before we fell in love and wed.
    593175|00000000||We prepared to leave the manor. My brother, he took offense, refused to bid me farewell.
    593176|00000000||Years on I returned, but found no sign of him. Folk claimed monsters had infested our home, come to nest there.
    593132|00000000||What happened to him?
    593133|00000000||Farewell.
    593135|00000000||My sympathies. So long.
   1008283|00000000||All we need now is a storm.
   1008281|00000000||How's your health?
   1008279|00000000||Greetings.
   1008277|00000000||Well, what are you looking at?
   1008275|00000000||Bloody hell.
   1008273|00000000||Someone, get help!
    439904|00000000||He… he ran out the other door! Catch him!
    440137|00000000||Hear that? Calm and quiet. All seems to be in order.
   1005156|00000000||We should go in. Just to be sure.
   1005158|00000000||You're relentless, aren't you. Fine. But wait here, please. Mother's certainly not in the mood for guests.
    440141|00000000||Aaaaaah!
    450485|00000000||What's this? Village abandoned all of a sudden?
   1029653|00000000||Heh, heh, cowards hid, likely pissin' themselves.
    450487|00000000||We've come for Bertram. Surrender him, and no one will get hurt!
   1062760|00000000||Open up! The quicker yous give 'im up, the better off you'll be!
   1062762|00000000||Bertram, we're comin' for you!
   1014143|00000000||Hm?
   1014139|00000000||Oh, a witcher.
   1014135|00000000||Call the cavalry!
   1065653|00000000||Ugh. Ghouls' nest.
    386024|00000000||How'd you find me?!
    586813|00000000||This way, Geralt.
    498846|00000000||But I pleaded… I begged…
    581797|00000000||Mother, it's me. Do you recognize me?
    498848|00000000||Wha-- What's happened to her?
    498850|00000000||I said I'd do it all. Give it 'ere, I'll scrub it again. Scrub it clean.
    498852|00000000||Mother!
    451775|00000000||Something's coming. Get ready.
    498832|00000000||Mother?
    498834|00000000||Oooooo! Aaargh!
    498836|00000000||Huh! Is-- Is that her?
    498838|00000000||No-- Noo… Impossible - we must do something! Witcher!
    498840|00000000||Aaaaaaaarrrgghhh!
    527069|00000000||Dammit! It's taking off! Hit the wings!
   1074459|00000000||There it is.
   1074614|00000000||Mhm. I see it.
   1074616|00000000||Picked a bad day to leave its nest.
    514117|00000000||You're slow dodgin'… Need to run you through the Gauntlet.
    514119|00000000||Yeah? Your parries are shit. Focus on improving that, smartass.
    512134|00000000||Big bastard!
    533866|00000000||We can handle this!
   1011830|00000000||There's a draft. Should be an exit here.
   1063324|00000000||Kluhg wouldn't 'ave sent us here if there wasn't.
   1063326|00000000||Must be a lever on this wall that'll open the secret passage.
    537522|09a967c8||Nilfgaardian
    577379|13ef63e4||Cleaver's Henchdwarf
    492569|00000000||The city weeps 'neath its veil of rain…
    495458|00000000||You needn't believe me, but even the Temple Guard's afraid to go out nights.
    495460|00000000||Yeeees, I'd heard that, too.
    506539|00000000||Should I see that philanderer again, or is it just a bad idea?
    506541|00000000||What do you think?
    492573|00000000||Hullo!
    492575|00000000||A minor or D minor?
    504133|00000000||Hmmm… Hm hm.
    492571|00000000||My my, who do my lovely eyes spy?
   1033001|00000000||Did you hear? Dandelion's been found! I was so sad with him away…
    492577|00000000||I doubt you know many rolled chords…
    504135|00000000||Hm, I really thought witchers would look more… witchery.
    576269|00000000||Clumsy oaf!
    492579|00000000||Hit a woman, would you?
   1018961|00000000||Somebody call the guards!
    492581|00000000||Ah! Oh, help!
    557085|00000000||Are you coming?
   1041997|00000000||Not sure I like any of this.
    539893|00000000||Ready. Follow me!
    553819|00000000||Lillad geach! …Uuugh! Lillad geach--
   1018502|00000000||Geralt!
    553818|00000000||Aaargh!
   1018499|00000000||Geralt!
    540090|00000000||Aaaaargh!
    539888|00000000||Can you teleport us to the other side?
    539889|00000000||I'd rather teleport us home. Do you really mean to follow them?
    566620|00000000||Teleport. Hurry up!
    539883|00000000||The Wild Hunt.
    539884|00000000||What?! Phantom riders? That means… I thought they didn't exist!
    566780|00000000||Feast your eyes on the nonexistent, then.
    592855|00000000||Hm. Got a navigator with them.
    592857|00000000||A what?
    557012|00000000||Come on!
   1004252|00000000||Baron's whoresons - they're runnin' rampant. No remedy for 'em…
   1004253|00000000||Spotted a lass at the inn yesterday… Took her, right in front of her husband…
   1004254|00000000||Bloody Baron didn't use to allow it.
   1004255|00000000||Too busy getting' drunk now his wife and daughter were taken…
    413637|00000000||Should send him back to the witch, might cure him of laziness.
    349590|00000000||Got a matter for your village witch. Know where I can find her?
    349598|00000000||I don't bother with her meself, but ask my man - he'll know.
    476651|00000000||Twerked his back so bad last week he could hardly move. So I sent him to the witch. Came back sprightly as a foal!
    349600|00000000||Where is he?
    349602|00000000||In the yard, no doubt. Pain's gone, but sloth's set in now. Should be huntin' foxberries, to feed our young 'uns.
    407968|00000000||Marian's lad - now that man, he knows how to provide for his family. Caught some water rats last, they had food for days.
    413643|00000000||Looking for the witch.
    413647|00000000||Farewell.
    413645|00000000||Farewell.
    413639|00000000||Greetings, ma'am.
    413641|00000000||Good day to you, sir. Need somethin'?
   1015387|00000000||What's the hurry?
   1015385|00000000||What's going on there?
   1015383|00000000||Hey, now!
   1015381|00000000||Quick!
   1056244|725770a2||Butler
   1008746|00000000||What about them mines he took the wenches from Bellows to…?
   1008748|00000000||I'd heard some lizard had woven its nest there. Wouldn't go down those holes if ye paid me!
   1008750|00000000||Mikel's no fool. Maybe he sniffed out a way to make some coin?
   1008752|00000000||A reptile'd cough up a coin purse…
   1025594|00000000||I recommend this dress. It makes one feel truly feminine.
   1025596|00000000||With all due respect, master elf… What could you know about that?
   1025598|00000000||A tailor just knows such things. Call it a sixth sense. So? May I pack it for you?
   1008969|00000000||Mutant.
   1008963|00000000||Insolence!
   1008961|00000000||Hey!
   1053614|00000000||I tell you, Yohen, the number of harlots in this one street… I never thought there were that many in the world!
   1053616|00000000||Very true. It's not just a free city. It's freewheelin'.
    506406|00000000||Any witcher needing a brother's aid must then bury his medallion in the earth. In doing so, he renounces his trade. Then he's gotta work for the village elder for a year.
    506408|00000000||You can take him there now.
    506413|00000000||Oooh… A witcher's surely worth two ordinary laborers.
    506415|00000000||At least two. Farewell.
    506403|00000000||He's gotta work off his failure.
    431133|00000000||Only one here.
    431143|00000000||Only one witcher here. This man's a charlatan - travels from village to village, cheating people.
    438302|00000000||No, no, it's not like that - I can explain everythin', I can!
    438304|00000000||He's a crook, a fraud! Oh, we've laws for this kind, special punishments. Thank ye for exposin' him, master witcher.
    506246|00000000||Oughta take him to the village elder.
    506247|00000000||Course. Elder can decide what to do with the scoundrel.
    506248|00000000||Last cheat came through, fellow payin' with shaved coins - we lopped his hands off.
    506274|00000000||I'm sure your elder takes care to make the punishment suit the crime.
    506276|00000000||Oughta start by taking his sword, tossing his medallion in the fire. Farewell.
    506244|00000000||Take him to the village elder.
    506243|00000000||Let him go.
    506281|00000000||Let him go - this time.
    506311|00000000||I… I… never again… I swear…
    506314|00000000||He's a halfwit, ain't he? Goin' after a ghoul…
    506316|00000000||Things'd be simple if the ghoul'd torn 'im apart. As it is, we've got ourselves a moral dilemma.
    506320|00000000||Let 'im go. But don't ye come near our village. We'll set the hounds on you if you do, is that clear?
    506325|00000000||Yeah?
    506332|00000000||Thank ye.
    506334|00000000||Get outta my sight.
    506416|00000000||Any witcher calling on a brother to aid him can never return to the site of their struggle together.
    506425|00000000||Not surprisin', given the shame he carries.
    506426|00000000||Come on, Mulik. Villagers should know the ghoul's been killed dead.
    506431|00000000||Farewell.
    506434|00000000||And thank you.
    506436|00000000||Get outta my sight.
    506404|00000000||He's not allowed to return to this village.
    423458|00000000||Monster was fierce - took two witchers to take it down.
    423538|00000000||That's 'tween you two. This 'un didn't want coin, so you've none to quarrel over.
    438288|00000000||Of course. So this witcher demanded the traditional reward. One other hallowed witchers' principle you should be aware of, then.
    438290|00000000||Yeah? What's that?
    431131|00000000||Took two witchers to kill this ghoul.
    485038|00000000||Monster's slain! Oy, what's this? Two witchers? We only hired one.
    423444|00000000||Thank ye, thank ye! Ye came just in time! A moment more and that ghoul would've filleted me like a flounder!
    423446|00000000||Actually, not sure I should've intervened. Your combat style - it's new to me. Shoulda just observed.
    506209|00000000||Where'd you complete your training? School of the Snail? But then where'd you get your wolf's head medallion…?
    423448|00000000||You're… You're the real thing, a witcher!
    423450|00000000||Mhm. What gave it away? That I didn't wet my trousers at the sight of one lousy ghoul? Answer the question: where'd you get the medallion?
    438270|00000000||I bought it… from a travelin' peddler. Oh, villagers a-comin'! Don't tell 'em about me, please!
   1028447|00000000||Hide! Monsters out there!
    462524|00000000||Build your boats in pinewood?
    462526|00000000||Course not. My wench dragged some pine here - wants me to whittle her a cradle.
    497834|00000000||Boat business not booming?
    497835|00000000||Not at all. Ain't no fish.
    462528|00000000||I wanna buy a boat.
    462508|00000000||Like to buy a boat.
    462530|00000000||See you later.
    462510|00000000||Farewell.
    497837|00000000||You again.
    346241|fd7deb62||Adventurer
   1004161|00000000||From plague, famine and war…
   1004162|00000000||Deliver us, ye gods!
   1004163|00000000||From fire, water and wraiths…
   1004164|00000000||Deliver us, ye gods!
    502094|00000000||Stop flaunting and fight!
    502091|00000000||Why bother with two swords when you can barely handle one?
    493563|00000000||Ha! I win!
    493564|00000000||Dammit!
   1052150|00000000||It's hard to believe Nienke dabbled in witchcraft… Such a nice old gran.
   1052152|00000000||Has she got a black cat? She has. Dried herbs? Plenty. The hunters find a moon-shaped birthmark on her? They did.
   1052154|00000000||But did you ever hear of her hurting anyone?
   1052156|00000000||It all came out during her interrogation. She confessed. She made Willem's mare die. And her foul whispers lead Gustaf to betray his wife.
   1052158|00000000||You should've been there when she burned! Fire'd barely licked her feet when she started screaming obscenities! Revealed her true nature, she did!
    589662|00000000||This was punishment.
   1003281|00000000||Sure of one thing. This was punishment.
   1003283|00000000||Even the witch hunters don't engage in this kind of torture. What sin could possibly merit it?
   1003285|00000000||Only the murderer knows that. And it's the key to finding him… or her.
   1013524|00000000||No motive. Murderer's mad.
   1013527|00000000||No motive to speak of. Murderer's mad, plain and simple.
   1013529|00000000||Unfortunate. Such individuals are hardest to catch…
   1013525|00000000||Rather not share my conclusion.
   1013531|00000000||Sorry… rather not share my conclusions just yet.
   1013535|00000000||I understand. For the good of the investigation. Will you at least share what you intend to do?
   1003339|00000000||Woodcarver's body - where was it found? It's important.
   1003341|00000000||Plan to investigate? Exciting. He died in his workshop, south of the market square, just beside the gate to Farcorners. That poor trobairitz was attacked there… city's abuzz about it.
   1003343|00000000||But the woodcarver, Eustace the corpse collector brought us the body. You should speak to him, saw him just round the corner, near… Oh, greetings, Your Reverence.
   1003345|00000000||Who are these people? I believe I made it clear no one was to be allowed in. Under any circumstances.
   1003347|00000000||You did, but… They're friends of the deceased. Here to collect the body.
   1003349|00000000||Out of the question. Show them out at once.
   1003351|00000000||As Your Reverence wishes. Gentlemen, follow me. You shall leave… via another route.
   1003296|00000000||Woodcarver's body - where was it found?
   1003298|00000000||Take it you two know each other?
   1003327|00000000||You old friends?
   1003329|00000000||Hubert taught me the rudiments of medicine. Long ago.
   1003331|00000000||And not very well. You've still not mastered certain basic principles. For example, that a doctor's role is to treat the ill, not save the world.
   1003333|00000000||You've not changed a bit.
   1003335|00000000||A compliment?
   1003337|00000000||No. A statement of fact. Thirty years… and you've not changed a bit.
   1003287|00000000||It's a lead worth following. Any idea what his name was?
   1003289|00000000||Fabian Meyer.
   1003291|00000000||And I'm Hubert Rejk, the coroner. I've come to perform the autopsy, but I see you've done it for me, Joachim. As always, you interfere where you're neither needed nor wanted. Drag others into trouble in the process. Who is this?
   1003293|00000000||A student. Lifelong learner. Got a couple questions for you.
   1003295|00000000||Very well, speak. But be quick. Reverend Nathaniel has come by for an inspection. He'll be here shortly.
    589687|00000000||It's some kind of sick ritual… You saw it - burns in the eye sockets, cavity where the heart should be, scalding liquid … All centering on warmth, heat, fire…
    589688|00000000||A fire eternal.
    589660|00000000||This was a ritual murder.
   1003180|00000000||All right. Think I know enough.
   1003182|00000000||Enlighten me, please. Because I've still no notion what this is about. What the motive might have been.
    571262|00000000||All right. I know enough.
    571058|00000000||Hands.
   1003056|00000000||Look at his hands. These welts… rope burns, right? He was tied up.
   1003058|00000000||I'd expect so. No one could sit through such torture unless bound.
   1003060|00000000||Speaking from experience?
   1003062|00000000||Yes, that of a victim. Spent a year in the dungeons of Tretogor. Long story.
   1005613|00000000||Some other time, maybe. See the callus? Our dwarf wore a ring. But someone took it off him.
    588213|00000000||You're probably right.
    588214|00000000||Right. Never mind.
    571059|00000000||Legs.
   1003064|00000000||See anything interesting on his legs?
   1003097|00000000||His right foot - the ankle's swollen, toenails broken. He clearly kicked something very hard… right before he kicked the bucket.
   1005615|00000000||Doesn't strike me as the right time for jokes.
   1005617|00000000||Apologies. We surgeons… we've a different sensibility.
   1005619|00000000||Mhm. And a different sense of humor.
    571056|00000000||Torso.
   1002953|00000000||Let's examine his torso.
   1002955|00000000||What have we here… Deep wound on the left side of his rib cage. And a scar the length of his stomach.
    588198|00000000||Check the scar.
    588226|00000000||Look at the scar. Wound's long and thin - an incision. But the edges are ragged.
    588395|00000000||Means nothing. Look, no swelling, no bruises. An old injury, perhaps an accident in the workplace?
    588197|00000000||Let's examine the chest wound.
    588222|00000000||Let's examine the chest wound. Yeah, heart carved out, wound cauterized.
    588223|00000000||Wait a minute, there's something else.
    588224|00000000||An egg, from an amphibian… A salamander? Scorched, but intact.
    588225|00000000||I attended some lectures in herpetology as a student. Afraid I don't recall any amphibians that would lay eggs in corpses. So either Professor Cochran was deeply mistaken, or this is our murderer's doing.
    588199|00000000||Open his abdomen.
    588396|00000000||Open the abdominal cavity.
    588397|00000000||Due warning - it will stink of rot.
    589663|00000000||Once fought a zeugl up to my waist in sewage, so I doubt-- Wait. Smell's not rot.
    589664|00000000||Formaldehyde. A medical novelty. Heavily diluted, it's remarkable at preserving organic tissue. In stronger proportions… it's more destructive than acid.
    589665|00000000||Explains why there's no smell of decay… And why his throat's scalded.
    588201|00000000||Let's examine something else.
   1003000|00000000||Let's look at something else.
    589680|00000000||Let's examine the mouth. Burns, blisters…
   1003054|00000000||Just like Priscilla's.
    588203|00000000||Look in his mouth.
    589677|00000000||See this? Incision made into the voice box.
    589679|00000000||Indeed. So thin as to be nearly unnoticeable.
   1003049|00000000||A small, extremely sharp instrument. Scalpel?
   1003051|00000000||But why? The wound is too small to bleed. And there are signs of swelling. The murderer… I believe he performed a tracheotomy. So the victim wouldn't die too soon.
    588204|00000000||His larynx has been cut.
    588202|00000000||Let's examine the eye sockets.
    589675|00000000||Those burn marks I see in his eye sockets?
   1003041|00000000||Yes. And some gray dust - ash, it seems. Very fine.
   1003043|00000000||Murderer gouged out his eyes. Then put burning coals in the sockets.
   1003045|00000000||So it seems. Looking at the wounds… it appears our woodcarver was still alive when it happened.
   1003002|00000000||Let's look at his head. Hair smells like it's burnt, like he was in a fire.
   1003004|00000000||Notice anything else? That his eyes have been scooped out, for instance?
    571057|00000000||Head.
    588196|00000000||Genitals.
   1013009|00000000||His genitals - we oughta inspect those.
   1013011|00000000||I see. You clearly find gonads fascinating. I fear I don't share your passion. Let's focus on other parts of his anatomy, shall we?
   1003101|00000000||I sincerely doubt they bear any relation to the matter…
    588212|00000000||We'll see.
    588218|00000000||We'll see. Pull down his trousers and… Shit.
   1003140|00000000||Syphilis, actually. Early stages. No sign of diffusion.
   1003142|00000000||Think there could be a connection…?
   1003144|00000000||Only as the killer's potential motivation.
    571053|00000000||Calluses on the fingers, sawdust in the beard, clothes sticky with sap. Must be our dwarf.
    588194|00000000||Excellent… I trust you don’t grow weak in the knees at the sight of blood?
    588195|00000000||Not a bit. Start the autopsy.
   1002938|00000000||Where?
   1002957|00000000||Let's examine something else.
   1032036|00000000||Ahem.
   1032037|00000000||What the hell? It's you! I know you! Mister dwarf, this is the thieving swindler I told you about. Are you following me, you scoundrel?
   1032038|00000000||Argh, ploughin' nonsense. I knows him, it's witcher Geralt. How goes it, master witcher?
   1033140|00000000||A witcher? Well, it all makes sense now. Mister dwarf, do not listen to him. The bastard will curse us.
   1033142|00000000||Ye trade heads with a troll?! A friend o' Yarpen Zigrin's a friend o' mine. Now sod off 'fore I lose me temper. Now!
   1033144|00000000||Abracadabra, hocus pocus.
   1043148|00000000||Gotta get inside.
    569555|00000000||Gotta get inside.
    569556|00000000||To liberate what?
   1033124|00000000||A few crates of crafting supplies.
   1033126|00000000||And what'll I tell Cleaver?
   1033128|00000000||That I knew the password?
   1033130|00000000||Excellent work in Vergen, master witcher. And the password's "The lion sleeps tonight."
   1074884|00000000||Oughta let me in.
   1074886|00000000||What I'm looking for's none of your business. Oughta just let me through.
   1074888|00000000||Way's all clear.
   1043150|00000000||Yarpen Zigrin sends his regards.
   1043152|00000000||By Rhundurin, just don't nick everything. And hurry! Get it done while I'm in the privy.
    569552|00000000||Yarpen sends his regards.
   1073820|00000000||Be back later.
   1073822|00000000||Just remembered I got something to do. I'll be back.
    569557|00000000||Just happened to be passing by.
    569558|00000000||Don't play me for a fool, witcher. Yarpen holds ye in high regard - don't ruin it.
   1033133|00000000||But--
   1033135|00000000||Come back when you're prepared to be honest.
   1033122|00000000||Me? Just passing by.
    507403|00000000||How goes it, master witcher? Anythin' specific you lookin' for in van Hoorn's warehouse?
   1004942|00000000||Aargh!
   1004998|00000000||Mother!
    525629|00000000||Of course I won't tell her.
    525631|00000000||All right, then I'll tell you.
    525625|00000000||He pretended not to know her, can you imagine?
    525627|00000000||The poor girl… Hahaha, how humiliating.
    525621|00000000||To my mind they're getting their just deserts.
    525623|00000000||I've never been fond of sorceresses.
    485609|00000000||Leave your horse! We have to! We're almost there!
   1044948|00000000||Left!
   1047873|00000000||Meet me at the temple!
   1047892|00000000||Ciri, over here! Quick!
    485462|00000000||They've barred all the gates. We have to run! Grab a horse! To the temple!
    475101|00000000||Heard talk of a pig you's hidin'…
    475103|00000000||Uh-- Them's lies, sir!
    475105|00000000||That so? Let's have a look.
   1047830|069826f1||Rock Troll
    472968|00000000||Go calm 'im down.
    474211|00000000||Go yerself. You know only Miss Tammy could calm his rages.
    473703|00000000||Rather not end up with a blade between my ribs.
   1053035|00000000||This Doctor von Gratz - he any good?
   1053037|00000000||Aye, he's good… but strange.
   1053039|00000000||Strange? What, he prescribe leeches for everythin'?
   1053041|00000000||No… Once some stray dogs took a bite outta me. Von Gratz sewed me up, expert hand and all… then told me to lead him to those hounds.
   1053043|00000000||So I showed him the alley and waited. Heard howlin', yelps… He came back and said, "A good doctor prevents as well as cures."
    515610|00000000||Fall in! We've the swamp to cross and those cursed Crones to hunt down.
   1045671|00000000||Too many elfies, running 'round town! A rock hit one and broke his crown! He called for help but none was found! All you elfies best leave town!
   1045673|00000000||Ow! Why, you little...!
   1045675|00000000||Halfling walkin' down the street, shorter than a daisy, best take pity on the freak, cook him up real tasty!
   1045677|00000000||Vile pups! I'll tan your hides with a rusty mace!
   1045681|00000000||Hahahaha!
    478294|add692ad||Thug
    171219|39c1e2d7||Radovid
   1010759|00000000||There he is!
   1010760|00000000||Get 'im!
   1084523|d191f4a3||King of Beggars' Henchman
    547250|00000000||What's left to think about? Shackle the whoreson! He was out to murder me!
    548192|00000000||Liar! Won't pin this on me, Danvind!
    548193|00000000||They told me: avoid doing business with dwarven scum! Stunted pricks always cheat! But to--
    548194|00000000||Twas you let the beast in there! 'Cause me bales o' silk were drivin' ye mad with jealousy!
    547252|00000000||Shove your bales up your arse!
    547253|00000000||Shut it! Or I'll lock you both up!
    516508|b0678eeb||Horse
    170704|20ef7b24||Captain
    532263|3ff15f20||Wealthy Townsman
    452150|00000000||A patrol. We can't let them see us.
    461104|00000000||Dammit… Hear that? Something's going on.
    461153|00000000||All for nothing. Let's go.
    461157|00000000||We need to join the others. Soon as possible.
    509036|00000000||Stop. Hear it?
    461100|00000000||Where's this hideout?
    461102|00000000||Not far, in the Bits. Now, quiet, Geralt. We'd rather not draw any attention to ourselves.
   1057770|00000000||Geralt, over here…
    439854|00000000||Have you checked the sewers beneath the Kingfisher?
    439856|00000000||No. Didn't think we'd have to take that route.
    455573|00000000||To think, a year ago guardsmen bowed to mages they passed in the street.
    455581|00000000||Now we have to flee the city like rats.
    582068|00000000||You could stay. You'd manage it somehow.
    582070|00000000||The others will never make it without me.
    439880|00000000||No guardsmen or hunters in sight. Everything seems in order.
    439882|00000000||Or we're too late…
    171358|4bda1210||Scoia'tael
    480179|00000000||Who are you and what d'you want?
    480180|00000000||What've you got back there?
    480247|00000000||Doing some sightseeing. Kinda curious about what's beyond this gate.
    480248|00000000||Me brother-in-law was curious. Worms been eatin' him for five years now.
    480596|00000000||Farewell…
    480597|00000000||I fare just fine without your wishes. Don't come again!
    480182|00000000||Farewell.
    480181|00000000||Can't tell? A freak.
    480249|00000000||Take a look. Whaddaya see?
    480250|00000000||Yellow eyes… Pair o' swords… Mutated killer, methinks…
    498195|00000000||Heard this place was a meeting spot for oddities.
    498197|00000000||Heard right. Know the password - get in free. Don't know it - gotta contribute to the grove's upkeep.
   1043969|00000000||Not in the habit of parting with my swords.
   1043971|00000000||In that case, we must part. Sod off, now.
   1043961|00000000||No chance.
   1043960|00000000||Fine.
   1043963|00000000||Fine. Make sure you don't lose them.
   1043965|00000000||No worries. Be waitin' for you once you're done with the king.
    525503|00000000||Let me in.
    525505|00000000||I won't pay. Let me in.
    525507|00000000||Yes, sir.
    480581|00000000||Old sow's farrowed piglets.
    480582|00000000||Oh… Welcome to the grove, brother.
   1062555|00000000||Old sow's farrowed piglets.
   1062557|00000000||I like to tiptoe through the tulips.
   1062561|00000000||I like to tiptoe through the tulips.
   1062563|00000000||Nope. Not the password.
   1062559|00000000||Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
   1062556|00000000||Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
    480579|00000000||Don't know the password.
    480580|00000000||Pay up, then.
    480594|00000000||Might be a problem there.
    480595|00000000||Then come back once you've solved it.
    480591|00000000||Fresh out of coin.
    480590|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
    480592|00000000||Catch.
    480593|00000000||You may enter.
   1043967|00000000||Oop. Right after you leave me your weapons. They'll be safe in me locker, here.
    480246|00000000||Ah, my old friend, the uh…
    480178|00000000||Open up!
   1014091|00000000||Greetings.
   1014089|00000000||Ke?
   1014087|00000000||Cut his arm off!
   1077493|00000000||Hah, my guardian and protector! I thank ye, I do!
    421065|00000000||Lemme see what you're offering.
    420995|00000000||Lemme have a look at your goods.
    421067|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
    421059|00000000||Need you to craft something for me.
   1028778|00000000||What would you say to a little game of gwent?
   1086517|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
    421069|00000000||So long.
    421061|00000000||Farewell.
    497665|00000000||Do you know any master armorers?
    497667|00000000||Could you make a breastplate if I provided a master's diagram?
    497669|00000000||Nah, and nor could anyone else here. Except for… what was his…?
    497671|00000000||Except for who?
    497673|00000000||There was one fellow… Fergus, a dwarf. Worked for me a while, with an apprentice, a lass.
    497675|00000000||Know what became of him?
    497677|00000000||They were good at what they did, so they moved on to Crow's Perch. Baron, his men need smithin' all the time. No lack of work there.
   1059129|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
    421063|00000000||So, you want a premade, or have you got a special order?
    487960|00000000||Not one escapes! Got it?
    487959|00000000||Oomph!
   1064241|00000000||Nothin' like some decent diversion, eh? Heheh.
   1064244|00000000||Now, come on. Dudu awaits backstage.
   1064239|00000000||Fuck it! Geralt! You mind droppin' down here a minute?!
    579259|00000000||I haven't the strength, Geralt. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him.
    491783|00000000||Hey, over here… You's a witcher, eh?
    492835|00000000||Got somethin' for your kind. Look… Rebis and hydragenum…
    492837|00000000||Perfect for brewin' some De Vries' Extract…
    492839|00000000||Won't find anyone else who can get you these things in all Novigrad.
    303143|809a4b8d||Strumpet
    492490|00000000||I should've played that music hall - my arse wouldn't be so wet.
    495462|00000000||The guards nabbed him, started ripping out his nails. And he gave up their hideout right quick.
    495464|00000000||Horseshit, that's what.
    506535|00000000||It's nice enough as a tavern, but the pay's dismal. I honestly don't know if I should take the work.
    506537|00000000||But of course!
    492494|00000000||Good morning!
   1033613|00000000||"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph" - quite the rousing little play.
   1032999|00000000||"The Doppler's Salvation" - quite the rousing little play.
    492498|00000000||Cut yourself while shaving?
    504096|00000000||I need that lute I saw at market yesterday. I'd sell my soul to the devil to get it…
    492492|00000000||Ahahahaha! Heeheeheehee!
    492496|00000000||Yes, handsome?
    504094|00000000||Well, hellooooooo.
    492500|00000000||Darnit!
    492506|00000000||Guards! Guards!
    492508|00000000||Noooooooooo!
   1018959|00000000||Thiieeeeeeef!
   1006075|00000000||What's yer problem?!
    437666|00000000||Where you scurryin' to, wretch? Let's see your pass!
    437668|00000000||Pass? What pass?
    437670|00000000||Kind of pass confirms you ain't no mage. Can't enter or leave Novigrad without it.
    450519|00000000||Sorry. Don't have a pass.
    450521|00000000||You'll scurry no further, then. Next!
    450523|00000000||Hang on… How do I get one?
    450525|00000000||Start by makin' an offerin' to the Church. Then you'll need three pure souls to confirm…
    450528|00000000||Let him through. Here's his papers.
    450531|00000000||Wha? But where'd…
    450534|00000000||Not your concern. Back to your post.
    450536|00000000||Regards from Sigi Reuven.
    450515|00000000||Don't have a pass.
    450517|00000000||Why the lockdown?
    450538|00000000||Why've you shut the city gates?
    450540|00000000||So's we can clean it of mages, witches and other scum that's crawled here since the war began.
    450542|00000000||Aim to catch every last one of 'em, toss 'em on a flamin' pyre, like poxy livestock.
    460104|00000000||Please, Count, wait, wait!
    460106|00000000||Oh, please don't take him from us, please!
   1004827|00000000||Your old lady just grown fat, or is she with child again?
   1004828|00000000||Shite luck, aye. Another bantlin' on the way.
   1004829|00000000||Best keep her close. You heard of the vampeer…?
   1004830|00000000||Oh, shut yer trap.
   1006685|00000000||You daft?
   1006596|00000000||Damn!
   1006605|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1006612|00000000||Something's brewing, right?
   1006620|00000000||At your service.
   1006681|00000000||Ah, welcome.
   1006687|00000000||Ooh, I'm about to get really mad.
   1015281|00000000||Will you go see Gremist now?
   1015283|00000000||With pleasure. After a storm of those proportions I shall gladly have a-- uuh, help him with his ritual. Till then!
   1015278|00000000||Will you go see Gremist now?
   1015279|00000000||For the best? Why?
   1015285|00000000||For the best? Why?
   1015287|00000000||If manipulating the weather carried no risks, they'd not give me peace. Make it rain, make the sun shine. Some would want storms, others a sea calm as a pond frozen over…
   1015289|00000000||This way folk petition me only when their need is great, not because they've had a whim.
   1015291|00000000||I get it. There're times I wish I didn't have to chase this nekker or that drowner…
   1007613|00000000||I've not managed a storm that fine for ages. Did you see the drops? The size of eggs!
   1007614|00000000||A little busy tending to the foglets. They weren't small, either.
   1007616|00000000||Ah yes, unfortunately, they always emerge. But perhaps that's for the best…
   1031422|00000000||How may I assist you?
   1090536|00000000||What do you offer?
   1028773|00000000||Yearning to play a few rounds of gwent. That oughta set me straight.
   1086467|00000000||What would you say to a round of gwent?
   1031438|00000000||So long.
   1031426|00000000||Farewell.
   1031425|00000000||Need some armor made.
   1035188|00000000||Need some armor.
   1031423|00000000||Oi, Geralt. How's the armor performin'? Here to order another?
    594070|00000000||This Louis - somehow doubt he's one of your best friends.
    594071|00000000||You know how it is in this trade.
    594072|00000000||Drink with someone in the evening, check if he's robbed you in the morning.
    594128|00000000||How'd you meet?
    594129|00000000||Was before Foltest kissed this world goodbye.
    594130|00000000||Louis was a wanted man in Aedirn.
    595596|00000000||Hefty bounty on his head, and normal contracts were hard to come by. So I decided to catch the bastard, make some coin.
    595601|00000000||Tracking him down proved easier than killing a drowner. He was, uh, merrymaking at the Golden Hanged Man, smack in the middle of Hagge.
    595598|00000000||Nabbed him, tied him up, but the guard post didn't open till dawn… so we had a few hours.
    595603|00000000||Started talking, killing time. Chat was so nice that once dawn came I let him go.
    595604|00000000||And that's why you trusted him…? Felt he owed you one?
    595606|00000000||I was stupid. Stupidity can cost you. But betrayal costs even more.
    456935|00000000||That's 'im. Get 'im.
   1042422|00000000||The Great Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby!
   1051568|00000000||Ride, run or crawl, make haste to the Vegelbud estate!
   1042420|00000000||Hear ye, hear ye! All onlookers, all riders!
   1051566|00000000||The venerable Vegelbuds invite you to the races! Thoroughbreds at full speed near the Vegelbud estate outside town!
    485615|00000000||Got her!
    485613|00000000||What if she jumps it?
    486027|00000000||Don't make me laugh.
    501105|00000000||Open up, in the name of the Fire! There's a mage inside, we know it - one Remi Villeroy! Sentenced to death in absentia!
    501107|00000000||We've been courteous enough. Batter down the door, we're going in!
   1006091|00000000||Oh, they burned so beautifully. Grand spectacle! I could watch one everyday.
    468244|00000000||Who drink barrels and ask for more? The infantry from Tregotor!
    468246|00000000||Pikes in air, swords to sky! Nilfgaard scum must die die die!
    468248|00000000||Who makes Emhyr wet his panty? Cavalry from Nimnar Valley!
    468250|00000000||Pikes in air, swords to sky! Nilfgaard scum must die die die!
    468844|00000000||What a pretty, pretty warsie,
    468846|00000000||When man fall dead off horsie.
    468848|00000000||Then make soup! Then make feast!
    468850|00000000||Good no wasting tasty meats!
    468853|00000000||Uu, urhhhh, ow…. Forgot next.
    411733|00000000||Mamma, come and see dem marching. It King Ravodid who call.
    478392|00000000||Your boy now in the army, lost to you he serve us all.
    478393|00000000||Your boy now in the army, lost to you he serve us all.
    539288|00000000||All right, we know all we need to know. Just one guard - at the entrance.
    539289|00000000||I'll take care of him.
    539290|00000000||Thought you might. Me nose ain't all that sensitive. I'll not find the right crates, so you gotta mark 'em with chalk. We'll get a cart in the meantime.
   1033074|00000000||Fine. What do I do when I'm done?
   1033076|00000000||Just leave the warehouse. Then we'll go in.
    499045|00000000||Yes? What is it?
    499029|00000000||Greetings. Can I have a word?
    499031|00000000||I am here to serve pilgrims who've come to venerate the goddess.
    499033|00000000||Mine's more an earthly matter.
    499035|00000000||What is it?
   1075325|00000000||A witcher? Here? It's the goddess' doing, it must be.
   1075327|00000000||Hm. Kindness like that can only mean one thing - you got a monster problem.
   1075329|00000000||It's no common monster. It's Morkvarg.
   1075342|00000000||The curse - tell me more.
   1075344|00000000||Archpriestess Ulve cast it…
    499259|00000000||It bound Morkvarg to the garden for all time. So even if he is killed, he returns there.
    499261|00000000||Mhm, so you said.
    497645|00000000||Notice I read didn't mention a curse.
    497646|00000000||All who live here know of it.
    497647|00000000||Could be, but I'm not from around here. Could use some information.
    497648|00000000||Archpriestess Ulve cast the curse…
    497618|00000000||The curse - tell me about it.
   1075340|00000000||Think I've run into Morkvarg.
   1075346|00000000||Might've already run into this Morkvarg. He a… werewolf?
   1075348|00000000||I know not. I… I'm afraid I've never seen him.
   1075350|00000000||Shame, that. Was hoping you could tell me more about him. Help me with my work.
    497656|00000000||You might speak with Toradar's son, Einar. He saw Morkvarg and his men descend on the garden. He was the sole pilgrim to escape with his life that day.
    503655|00000000||Settled in Larvik. You'll find him at the landing there, provided he's not at sea.
    497653|00000000||Could you be more specific? "Monster" can mean a lot of things these days. Folk have been known to call me that.
    497654|00000000||I'm afraid I cannot tell you more, for I've never seen him myself. But…
    497655|00000000||Hm?
    497649|00000000||What did Morkvarg turn into?
    497650|00000000||Mind if I ask you something else?
    497661|00000000||Never heard of this Morkvarg. What is it exactly?
    497662|00000000||Not what - who.
    497664|00000000||The worst man Skellige has ever known. He held nothing sacred - raided the lands of his own clan, took gold from Nilfgaard, murdered women heavy with child, and children he…
    499268|00000000||Mhm. I know the type.
    499270|00000000||They said he feared but one thing, albeit secretly - the wrath of the gods. Morkvarg decided to prove everyone, himself included, wrong. So he came to Hindarsfjall to raid the goddess' garden. This was years ago.
    499272|00000000||Archpriestess Ulve stood in his path. He stabbed her in the breast and cast her into the mud. As her blood gushed forth, she cursed Morkvarg… and he transformed into a monster.
    497619|00000000||Morkvarg - what're we talking about?
    497595|00000000||Farewell.
    499247|00000000||Farewell.
    499249|00000000||The goddess protect you from all evil.
    497621|00000000||Farewell.
    507292|00000000||Here for my reward.
    503686|00000000||I've come for my reward.
    503688|00000000||But can you be sure that--?
    503690|00000000||Morkvarg's gone, for good. Guaranteed, or you'll get your coin back.
    503692|00000000||I shall hold you to that, witcher.
    503653|00000000||Here for my reward.
   1075335|00000000||Morkvarg. Lemme tend to him for you.
   1075333|00000000||I could take care of this Morkvarg for you.
    497593|00000000||Heard you're having problems with Morkvarg.
    497607|00000000||Word is you've got a problem - Morkvarg, that's its name? Could tend to it for you.
    497614|00000000||Do so and you will greatly please the goddess.
    497615|00000000||That's nice and all, but coin's what pleases me.
    497616|00000000||You look the type. Fret not, I shall pay. But only if you rid us of Morkvarg - once and for all.
    499076|00000000||There have been those who have killed Morkvarg, but a curse has brought him back each time.
    497591|00000000||Greetings. What may I help you with this time?
    499040|00000000||Morkvarg - got a few more questions.
   1002922|00000000||Keira!
   1018195|00000000||Over here!
   1002756|00000000||Keira?
   1043705|00000000||Don't ye cry, Nissa. I've barred the door, none'll enter.
    388752|00000000||Oi! There they are!
    352179|00000000||Something under the floorboards. Maybe they're loose. Or I could just wedge one up…
    479926|00000000||She couldn't 'ave taken it all with her. Could she?
    481151|00000000||Sorceress - it's like a witch with muscle. Casts a spell and all's gone in a flash.
    481153|00000000||Well, she was in a rush. Musta left somethin'.
    481155|00000000||And what of it? This place has been picked through.
    427799|00000000||What was this about? Why'd they want to burn you alive?
    427801|00000000||They came to rob me. I refused to betray where I keep my valuables, so they brought in a cart full of firewood, barred me inside and set fire to the thing.
    427803|00000000||Probably counting on you being swayed. Though I doubt they would've let you live even if you'd talked.
    427805|00000000||I've yet to thank you for your aid, vatt'ghern. My coin lies concealed in a hollowed-out stump behind the house. Take what you wish. It's dangerous to possess too much in these times.
    451753|00000000||Thank you. Farewell.
    416055|00000000||I don't belong to anyone.
    416107|00000000||Don't belong to anyone. Down to business, I want to get this done quickly.
    416109|00000000||Ah. So that's how it's to be.
    416188|00000000||I'll look around.
    416214|00000000||Ladies of the Wood don't know what this power is?
    416216|00000000||They know all. Old Thecla claimed they be punishin' us. Folk stopped respectin' 'em. Some even call 'em witches.
    416220|00000000||But must not be they, for they sent you.
    396593|00000000||I'll look around the Whispering Hillock.
    416212|00000000||Ye be careful, master witcher. Don't ye treat this evil light.
    418760|00000000||You don't wanna know.
    380679|00000000||Believe me, you don't wanna know.
    418668|00000000||What have ye done?
    418756|00000000||Destroyed something, not sure what.
    380667|00000000||Not sure what was lurking there. But it lurks no more.
    418664|00000000||What did you do, witcher?
    380673|00000000||I freed the evil spirit.
    380685|00000000||Didn't have to fight anything or anyone. I simply freed the spirit.
    380687|00000000||Ye did what?! Freed the evil, so it can prowl the world as it will?
    416299|00000000||Did what had to be done.
    416301|00000000||An' if it returns?
    382159|00000000||Ask the Ladies of the Wood to help.
    380675|00000000||Doesn't matter.
    380689|00000000||Went up the hill, took care of the problem. The details are my concern.
    380691|00000000||Aye, truly said. I knows naught of such things anyway.
    380707|00000000||There's payment. Take it to the Ladies, will ye?
    380709|00000000||What the hell was that?
    380711|00000000||Tis our pact. Ye're a stranger, ye don't know life here. It's honest pay for their protection.
    416303|00000000||So all those ears in the woods…
    416309|00000000||Put it out yer mind, master. Ye soon be leavin', and we must tarry on. Our young'uns, and their young'uns after 'em.
    420673|00000000||No gods nor masters watch over Velen. The land is no man's. He who wants to survive must seek his own protectors.
    380693|00000000||The Crones, or the Ladies of the Wood, as you call them, said to remind you about payment. Take it you know what they want.
    380695|00000000||Aye, I do. Gimme the dagger… Be back soon.
    380681|00000000||Some being had come to possess the tree's heart. I destroyed the heart and its inhabitant.
    380683|00000000||So it were a ghost…
    416297|00000000||Will it be back?
    420667|00000000||No.
    380671|00000000||I destroyed the evil spirit.
    380677|00000000||An evil spirit had possessed a tree on the hill. It was responsible for the killings.
    418666|00000000||How'd ye dispel this evil?
    418758|00000000||A spirit had possessed the tree.
    418754|00000000||Took care of your problem.
    418742|00000000||Solved your problem. Just in case, though, avoid the Whispering Hillock for a while.
    418744|00000000||Cannot be... Were somethin' lurkin' there?
    416245|00000000||I solved the problem.
    416166|00000000||When did all this start?
    416168|00000000||Three year back. I remember - 'twas a warm day - went to check the snares for game.
    416170|00000000||Pulled a hare from me trap. It grew dark of a sudden, though it was nigh on noontime. Thought it was a storm at first.
    416172|00000000||A squeal pierced the air, near burst me ears. The hare rotted in my hands, and the leaves shriveled and yellowed, though it were yet the start of summer.
    416190|00000000||Times've been ill ever since. Folk's teeth turn black as charcoal. Womenfolk fight like polecats, bawlin' and brawlin' over nothin'.
    416192|00000000||The young'uns... Born crippled... Lame... Fear and cursing... Long have we pled for the Ladies' help.
    416133|00000000||How long's it been like this?
    416131|00000000||More details.
    416135|00000000||Need more details.
    416145|00000000||Ye must see for yourself. Me gran's mum whacked me crosswise for strayin' near the Whispering Hillock. But what happens there now's a wonder!
    416162|00000000||A few times folk from 'round here gathered to chop down the trees and burn the cursed soil back to use. None returned.
    416164|00000000||The ground 'neath the weeds is white with human bones.
    396585|00000000||I'm supposed to help solve your problem. Tell me what it is - just the essentials.
    396587|00000000||The war awoke an ancient power. An evil one that feeds on bloodshed. Nightmares haunt our nights and days. Folk sleepwalk from their homes, never to return.
    396589|00000000||Under the tree on the Whispering Hillock they lie, unburied all: fathers, sons, daughters and mothers. Folk're afeard to move them.
    396591|00000000||You must go there. The dark powers must be cast off.
    416115|00000000||Let's get to the problem.
    416127|00000000||Ever meet the Ladies of the Wood?
    416129|00000000||Never. They only shows themselves to the chosen. Perchance one day I too will be summoned.
    416113|00000000||Ever seen them?
    416111|00000000||A certain young woman visited the... Ladies of the Wood.
    416117|00000000||Hear about an ashen-haired woman meeting the Ladies of the Wood?
    416119|00000000||I ain't heard nothin' about that. Beg your question to the Ladies, and they may answer. They knows all that happens in Velen.
    416121|00000000||They got informers?
    416123|00000000||The woods listen for them. A lone word at an ill hour can arouse their wrath. But they hear pleas and prayers as well.
    416125|00000000||Once a swineherd lost a sow, sat and cried at the crossroads. The sow ran out o' the trees, as if chased by a devil. Straight to the swineherd.
    416097|00000000||So, you know who sent me. Good, easier that way.
    416099|00000000||Forgive me... Didn't know ye came from the Ladies of the Wood.
    416101|00000000||They help you often?
    416103|00000000||From the time of his Cutting, every man is theirs... They be harsh mistresses, but they're fair, just. Demanding they can be, but then nothin' in life comes easy.
    416105|00000000||Who drove off the plaguey airs? Who gave us seeds to plant? Round the other villages they be eatin' the soles of their boots. Whereas we? Well, we get along well enough.
    416053|00000000||Glad we understand each other.
    380162|00000000||Aye, master. I didn't know you belong to them.
    385187|00000000||What's bothering the villagers?
    420645|00000000||Nice village.
    420647|00000000||Aye.
    420649|00000000||A real pearl of the swamps.
    420651|00000000||If ye say so.
    420653|00000000||You get by all right?
    420655|00000000||Aye, winter to winter, somehow we survive.
    380160|00000000||Recognize this dagger?
   1028145|00000000||Crushed legs. Bled to death after they wrecked.
   1022620|00000000||Tracks're old and faded. A woman and child?
   1025973|00000000||Dragging their feet…
   1022621|00000000||Strange crest. Not northern, not Nilfgaardian.
   1022622|00000000||Same crest as on the sunken ship.
   1022627|00000000||Same crest I saw on the wreck near Ursten.
   1026279|00000000||Woman's dead. Child's disappeared.
   1028115|00000000||Same language the woman in the cave near Ursten spoke. I should show these to her.
   1025506|00000000||Know what irks me most about Novigrad? The fuckin' proportions.
   1025508|00000000||Stairs too high, chairs too narrow, tankards too small. And the wenches're too bleedin' large.
   1025510|00000000||And when I walk down the street, I'm only ever starin' at someone's arse!
   1025512|00000000||That part's not all bad…
    403032|00000000||Competitors, saddle up! On three!
   1051491|00000000||One!
   1051493|00000000||Two!
   1051495|00000000||Three!
   1051497|00000000||Off you go!
    384130|00000000||Ready!
    400446|00000000||The fires, watch them. Let nothing break the circle.
    506242|00000000||Didn't comment on your deed?
    506254|00000000||What? She say something about what you did?
    506256|00000000||Letta… She don't say much of anything anymore. Hasn't for a while.
    506258|00000000||See, uh, Letta's sick. Somethin'… somethin's not right in her head. Started with her memory, she'd forget things, then… then she stopped recognizin' folk, even me. And now… now she don't even speak.
    506264|00000000||Thought if she saw the pearl somethin'd wake inside her. You know… We talked a lot about that stupid promise - it was our joke, just ours, for years. But… no, no… It didn't work.
    506266|00000000||Sorry.
    506268|00000000||As am I. Farewell, Geralt. Gods guide you the Path.
    506250|00000000||Sure as hell should. Pretty damn ungrateful of her otherwise.
    506252|00000000||It's… a bit more complicated.
    506241|00000000||Not sure? She an ingrate?
    497984|00000000||Geralt, witcher and pearl hunter! There y'are, your coin. Earned every last bit… I'd never 'uve done it without you.
    497985|00000000||Was it worth it?
    497986|00000000||I think so, aye… I suppose Letta likes it.
   1052655|00000000||You missed a cracking execution… Pyre was built of wet wood. Barely smoldered.
   1052657|00000000||Witch coughed and howled but wouldn't die. And if that weren't enough, it started pourin' rain and the fire went out.
   1052659|00000000||Ugh. Bad luck to worse.
   1052661|00000000||Wench's hair was burnt, skin was charred… but she was still breathing.
   1052663|00000000||So? Did you finish her off?
   1052665|00000000||No. Thought to myself, it's clear the gods want her to suffer. Threw her back in her cell… she died two days later.
    380142|00000000||Think that's all of them… That was close.
    381687|00000000||He did… I cracked. Couldn't listen to you suffer.
    381689|00000000||Nice of you… But I could've handled it. Really.
    496446|00000000||He did… Until I asked about the treasure.
    496448|00000000||Geralt… We talked this over, you agreed…
    496450|00000000||Ugh, fine. Never mind.
    381691|00000000||No, he didn't. Sensed right off it was all a front.
    381679|00000000||I must say, trickery and deceit - not your strong suits.
    381681|00000000||True. I prefer straightforward solutions.
    381683|00000000||Yeah. Fight first, ask questions later.
   1074486|00000000||I'll search his body. You search the room.
   1074488|00000000||I'd start with the desk.
    381693|00000000||We should search the office. Maybe we can find some documents mentioning Dandelion…
    434864|00000000||Axii in a crowd…? Geralt, there was no way that could work.
    434866|00000000||Sorry… I couldn't let them torture you. You mean too much to me.
    381685|00000000||What happened? I thought Menge took the bait…
   1067416|00000000||Got no time to negotiate with trolls. Step aside, Thaler.
   1067413|00000000||Time's short. Let him go or I'll kill you.
   1067419|00000000||Now let's all stay calm. Thaller'll be back. He just… needs to come with me… we'll, uh, get some leather for your shoes.
   1067421|00000000||Heeeeeh?
   1067423|00000000||Listen to Geralt. He's tellin' the ploughin' truth.
   1067425|00000000||Heeeeeh?
   1067427|00000000||Look at your feet - they're fuckin' mammoth. Need a damn bale o' leather to make shoes for 'em. Understand?
   1067429|00000000||Me and Geralt, we'll get some cocksuckin' leather. Then I'll come back and make your blasted shoes for you.
   1067470|00000000||Shoeses Pogg for? And Rogg for?
   1067472|00000000||Two pairs, for each of you gnarled pricks.
   1067474|00000000||Hmm… Tala go. But backcome must!
   1067476|00000000||Knew you buggers were good mates. Sit tight. Be back in a bit!
   1067414|00000000||Need him for a minute, no more. He'll be back.
   1067467|00000000||I need this man. He's coming with me.
   1067488|00000000||I can see you've made friends. But Thaler needs to come with me.
   1067490|00000000||Blood nowhere Tala go! Tala shoeses makes!
   1067492|00000000||But I need him.
   1067494|00000000||Tala here stay. You shoeses got! Ogg shoeses gotnot, Rogg gotnot, Pogg gotnot.
   1067496|00000000||Tala shoeses make, Tala go.
   1064182|00000000||Thaler?
   1067377|00000000||Shoulda known. Who better to teach trolls how to cuss.
   1067379|00000000||Geralt?! My, my, been bloody years.
   1067381|00000000||This who?!
   1067383|00000000||Relax, Ogg, this bugger's an old friend of mine.
   1067385|00000000||Buggafrenold go! Or wes in soup throw!
   1073817|00000000||I'd make for an awfully veiny morsel.
   1067387|00000000||Right, true that. Just look at the ploughin' bastard - naught but skin and bones.
   1067389|00000000||Well, gentletrolls, high time I traveled on. You, uh, practice what I taught you. Give you a fuckin' exam next time I come through.
   1067391|00000000||Tala go no! Tala sit… sit arsedown! Tala sockcuck shoeses make!
   1091095|00000000||Hey, wake up.
    379099|00000000||Halt! Who goes there?!
    457388|00000000||Donar an Hindar - did I get it right?
    457390|00000000||You did. And you're that witcher they call the White Wolf. What do you want?
   1075211|00000000||Listen, need to broach a difficult topic… A young man from your clan - Skjall.
   1075213|00000000||Craven, you meant to say.
   1075215|00000000||That's just it. It was unjust of you to strip him of his name. He didn't run away, flee out of fear, he--
   1075217|00000000||Only blood can clear one of shame. Words change nothin'. Not his, not yours.
   1075209|00000000||Skjall - you should restore his honor.
   1017765|00000000||At least Morkvarg's a problem no more, thanks to you. Now if you could send the king of the Wild Hunt the same way…
   1017767|00000000||All in good time.
   1017763|00000000||And now we must deal with an ulfhedin. In short, everything's grand.
   1017759|00000000||What's new on Hindersfjall?
   1017761|00000000||New? Lofoten lies in ruins, the garden has been devastated…
   1016815|00000000||Any news from Hindarsfjall?
    320709|00000000||Farewell.
    320707|00000000||Farewell.
   1016816|00000000||You're the eldest of the jarls, right?
   1017322|00000000||With Bran gone, by my count that makes you the eldest of the jarls.
   1017324|00000000||Aye, it does. But I trust it'll not be for long.
   1017326|00000000||Uh, not like any of the others stand to out-age you.
   1017328|00000000||Nay. But I'll gladly pass the honor to the next in line.
   1017330|00000000||I've lived my fill: steeped my hand in the blood of foes, felt the warmth of the southern sun and the bite of northern winds, the touch of women of the east and west. Now, I wish to die a death worthy of song.
    457361|00000000||Greetings, Geralt.
    591332|00000000||We'll wait here. Wouldn't want to get in your way.
    591346|00000000||We'll wait here. Wouldn't want to get in your way.
    591330|00000000||Need to tend to the monster. Doubt I'll have to look far. Wyverns like to herd their prey towards their nests.
    591249|00000000||I'll tend to the monster.
    591251|00000000||Danger's passed. Beast must be long gone.
    591253|00000000||And I expect he's waitin' out there. Ready to spring soon as we come out.
    591255|00000000||Didn't attack me.
    591257|00000000||Probably seen you're a witcher. Clever one, that lizard.
    591265|00000000||If you're not willin' to help - go. We'll wait here.
    591153|00000000||Danger's passed.
    591259|00000000||Tell me what happened.
    591266|00000000||Some traders hired us. To protect 'em along the high road, they said. 'Fore we knew it, they'd bound us like calves.
    591271|00000000||Why?
    591272|00000000||They were kind enough to explain - and real precise - that we were necessary sacrifice for progress and trade.
    591294|00000000||So they left us - tied to the wagon as beast bait. Weren't long 'fore a huge lizard appeared, as if its master had whistled.
    591323|00000000||Monsters must've learned by now that army supplies travel down this road.
    591325|00000000||Aye, clever one, the lizard. Cut us off straight away, left us to crawl in here. Poor Thomil didn't make it.
    591151|00000000||What happened? Tell me.
    591152|00000000||Which one of you's Thomil?
    591348|00000000||Which one of you's Thomil?
    591350|00000000||That one over there - beast got him. But… how do you know?
    591352|00000000||His brother asked me to come and find you.
    557881|00000000||By Kreve! Your eyes, they shine so in the dark, thought at first it were the lizard comin'!
    557882|00000000||Thing that attacked - how big was it?
    557883|00000000||Well, too big to squeeze in here! It were huge. And those teeth, ugh! We barely escaped.
    591148|00000000||Wonder if it killed the traders… Whoresons sure had it comin'.
    591243|00000000||Important thing now's to get outta here. Will ye help, master witcher?
   1046794|00000000||Hm… A dedication to the baron and his wife. Seems they had friends in high places in Vizima.
   1046802|00000000||Ciri must've used these.
   1046804|00000000||Looks like she left in a hurry.
   1046786|00000000||So, Ciri was here…
   1046790|00000000||"The Natural Obscurity of Curses" by Lydia van Bredevoort. Where'd Ciri get this?
   1046859|00000000||A spinning top.
   1046861|00000000||Gretka's toy.
   1074199|060c8d59||Julia
   1064516|00000000||Witcher Geralt? Up you go. Boss has been waitin'.
    420830|00000000||Dead… Anabelle was no ordinary ghost. She's a pesta.
    450632|00000000||And now she's free.
   1054315|00000000||Oh, c'mere, hero, give us a kiss!
    462399|00000000||Fine. Lead the way.
    462380|00000000||Fine. Lead the way.
    462356|00000000||You've killed enough humans already.
    462390|00000000||Set your weapon aside. You've killed enough humans already.
    462392|00000000||No, no I have not - at least one more must die. Aep me!
    462358|00000000||Just out for a stroll.
    462394|00000000||Oh, just out for a stroll. Getting some fresh air.
    470579|00000000||I hope you find yourself amusing - but I'm not laughing. Aep me!
    462403|00000000||Afraid I can't agree to that.
    462405|00000000||An error. The last you'll ever make. Aep me!
    462382|00000000||Can't agree to that.
    462360|00000000||Need to talk to your commander. It's important.
    462362|00000000||I don't trust you.
   1051082|00000000||Figured as much when I saw your bow aimed at me… Still have me in your sight. And I'm just not prone to doing stupid things. I can assure you of that.
   1051084|00000000||I'll be assured when you hand me your weapons. C'mon, your swords. Drop them, and I'll take you to Vernossiel.
    462354|00000000||Need to talk to your commander.
    462348|00000000||One step more and you'll gain a new hole in your head, dh'oine. What do you seek here?! Speak!
   1028755|00000000||Trade's good and all, but I'm hankering to play some cards. Gwent, specifically.
   1028754|00000000||Let's play cards.
    421282|00000000||Huh. So long.
    421270|00000000||Farewell.
    421268|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    421284|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
   1077491|00000000||Oh, savior's here.
    421266|00000000||What?
    491349|00000000||Geeeralt! In the nick of time, as always!
    493536|00000000||Zoltan, with your boot to someone's ass, as always.
    491350|00000000||Who were those men?
    491351|00000000||Local color. I wasn't gone more'n a moment. Long enough for them to turn our home into theirs!
    493539|00000000||All right, time for some spring cleanin', I've got to boot 'em all out. Care to join me?
    493541|00000000||With pleasure.
    491367|00000000||Hear that? I'll give 'em hell, I will!
    493544|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
    491419|00000000||Ah, reminds me of our days of yore, eh?
    491420|00000000||Yeah, almost like we never left Vergen.
    458124|f759b018||Nilfgaardian Soldier
   1014161|00000000||Death's here!
   1014141|00000000||Blood!
   1014134|00000000||What a ride!
   1014124|00000000||How are you?
   1014126|00000000||You enlisting?
   1014120|00000000||Greetings.
   1014118|00000000||Someone give me a cudgel.
   1014116|00000000||Had to bathe sooner or later.
   1052983|00000000||Have you heard? Witch hunters in the village.
   1052985|00000000||Got a nephew in Novigrad… Said they show no mercy. Got a taste for torture.
   1052994|00000000||Rubbish. Decent folk got nothin' to fear. They won't find no heresy in my home.
   1052996|00000000||Oh, mean to say you didn't tie a red bow to the cradle to ward off evil? Or hang bat skulls for good luck?
   1052998|00000000||Naye, I did… But that's normal, me gran did it, and her gran before that.
   1053000|00000000||For every magic bauble they find, hunters deal ten lashes to every person livin' in the hut. Including children.
   1032622|00000000||"'Cause when you pluck the Red eagle, you've to start with its stones!"
   1032624|00000000||Quiet down!
   1032631|00000000||They'll hear you!
   1032626|00000000||Let 'em! Let Radovid hisself hear me song!
   1032628|00000000||I'm sure he'd like it! 'Cause he's… he's a good chap!
   1032633|00000000||… not at all a loony tosser like folk say.
    398979|00000000||Get outta here!
    398977|00000000||Piss off… Now!
    420733|00000000||Once there was a wicked witchy,
    420735|00000000||Living in a mire,
    420737|00000000||Had a hut made out of butter,
    420739|00000000||Pfft-- The spark expired.
    351337|00000000||We don't serve lushes, shavers, caretakers or students from Philosophers' Hall.
    351339|00000000||Do I look like a, um… any of the people from that list?
    514409|00000000||Doesn't hurt to check. Just so it's clear how things stand.
    514412|00000000||So what'd they do to you, the students from…
    514413|00000000||Rather not talk on it, all right? What's your poison?
    512536|00000000||So long.
    351333|00000000||Take care.
    351331|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    421985|00000000||Mind if I have a look?
    425015|00000000||Oh, I remember you. What'll it be?
    513738|00000000||Looking for Junior.
    513740|00000000||Argh. Welcome to the Whoreson Hunters' Club. Alas, we're fresh out of membership cards. And you're outta luck far as Junior goes - bugger's not here.
    513742|00000000||Know where I can find him?
    513744|00000000||No.
    513730|00000000||Where's Whoreson?
    511166|00000000||Bloody mess.
    513692|00000000||Just… sorta happened.
    513728|00000000||Came here, polite and all, to invite Whoreson Junior to a get-together with his mates. Became obvious right quick that none here acknowledged the ancient rite of hospitality.
    513731|00000000||What happened here?
    513746|00000000||I'm gonna take a look around.
    513748|00000000||Got my eye on you.
    513732|00000000||Gonna look around.
    513729|00000000||You in charge?
    513734|00000000||You in charge here?
    513736|00000000||What's it to you?
    526001|00000000||Greetings.
    526003|00000000||Ach, you're Reuven's mate, aren't you. Heard of you.
    511177|00000000||Lingerin', lingerin' like a fart in me dad-in-law's pants!
    511176|00000000||Workin' here. Stop proddin' me arse like you're lookin' to poke it.
    533280|00000000||Leave or die.
    533992|00000000||Get outta here, or I'll kill you.
    533993|00000000||Criminy, what's with the aggro, the talk o' killin', doll?!
    533994|00000000||Who told you to butt in, eh?
    533995|00000000||Huh?
    533996|00000000||You all right, darlin'?
    544877|00000000||This masquerade… just not a good idea, I don't think.
    533998|00000000||Ugh, see what you've done?! He's broken character now.
    533999|00000000||I think I'll be on my way.
    534000|00000000||I should think so.
    533990|00000000||Get lost.
    533991|00000000||Errrm…
    533279|00000000||Get lost.
    534009|00000000||I can make him leave.
    534010|00000000||I'm lost. Is he in the scenario?
    534011|00000000||Scenario?
    534012|00000000||Stop spoilin' our fun, all right?
    534013|00000000||Agh, great. Ugh, this git's completely blown the mood for me.
    534014|00000000||Lemme get out of your way. Just… maybe find some place a little more secluded?
    533281|00000000||Want me to get rid of him?
    563084|00000000||All right, figure it out without me.
    563085|00000000||Fuck off, White One! Nobody gives a shit what you think! And you, get yer arse movin'! Let's go!
    563083|00000000||I'm done here.
    533980|00000000||What's going on here?
    533981|00000000||Fuck all to do with you! Piss off!
    533982|00000000||Lady doesn't feel like talking to you.
    533983|00000000||I can handle this.
    533984|00000000||Shut yer trap!
    175240|06341a17||Molly
   1044165|002e13b4||Bear
    432006|00000000||Some kind of mechanism. Let's see what it does.
    537567|00000000||Palm trees have sprouted on Skellige. Now pay up.
    537568|00000000||It can't be! Of course I shall pay Sukrus! A letter of credit acceptable? Redeemable at the Vivaldis' bank? Yes? I'm on my way!
    537538|00000000||Palm trees grow on Skellige.
    537569|00000000||I don't have time for this. So long.
    537539|00000000||I don't have time for this.
    537537|00000000||Got a problem with Sukrus?
    537540|00000000||Got a problem with Sukrus?
    537541|00000000||I thought - mead! I shall import mead! Daft idea for a business! The import duties - my bollocks shrivel at the thought! I paid the bastard what we agreed less half the duties. And palm trees will sooner sprout in Skellige--
   1008083|00000000||Yeah, I know.
    541373|00000000||Greetings. I'm Mr. Sukrus' collector. Come to get--
    541374|00000000||Mr. Sukrus? The man's a boor! I do not deal with illiterate peasants! Tell him I'll pay - just as soon as palm trees sprout on Skellige.
   1038671|00000000||Greetings. Here to collect…
   1038673|00000000||Coin for Sukrus! Oh yes, I know. But I'll not pay the bastard another copper. Palm trees will sooner sprout in Skellige!
    537571|00000000||Thief! Thief! At him!
    537572|00000000||He's gone mad! Run!
   1033153|00000000||The Tuirseach clan, we're kings among the clans…
    463493|00000000||You have no possible excuse.
    463495|00000000||Don't kill us…
    463497|00000000||I'd never dull my blade on the likes of you.
    463501|00000000||Harber. Harber!
    463503|00000000||Let's go.
    463479|00000000||That's no excuse. Nothing is.
    463483|00000000||Get out of here, or you'll burn anyway.
    463485|00000000||But… How's that?
    463487|00000000||Guardsmen'll decide this was an ambush. You know the penalty for that.
    463489|00000000||But this is our home. We can't just…
    463491|00000000||Do what you want.
    463481|00000000||Get out of here before the guards come.
    461140|00000000||How much they pay you for them?
    463374|00000000||Please, sir… Mercy!
    463376|00000000||How much? A bushel of grain? A barrel of herrings?
    463378|00000000||Leave him be! I talked him into callin' the guard… They would've found 'em anyways. Then they'd 'uve burned us all!
   1015181|00000000||You ought to shave, get a haircut…
   1015179|00000000||Welcome.
   1015175|00000000||Nice day.
   1015171|00000000||Simpleton!
   1015169|00000000||Don't kill me! I'll pay!
    515807|a65b819c||Baron's Henchman
    514182|00000000||White Wolf! Welcome to the Passiflora! Oh - no sign of recognition in your eyes.
    514184|00000000||Greetings, uh…
    514186|00000000||Don't fret, I'm sure I look quite different from when we last saw each other.
    514188|00000000||Er… which was…?
    514190|00000000||Oh, eons ago. You and Master Dandelion appeared, two halflings in tow. What a smash they were, the little chaps. We recount that night to this day.
   1070999|00000000||Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
   1071005|00000000||Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
   1071008|00000000||They await. This way, please.
    514180|00000000||Could it be that all roads lead to the Passiflora? Welcome back!
    514283|00000000||Mmmm. When I look at you… why, I almost regret I'm no longer on active duty.
    514202|00000000||I'd love to meet the rising generation of Passiflora buds.
    514174|00000000||I'd like to see them first.
    514170|00000000||Actually, I'd just like to buy something.
    514172|00000000||Like to buy something.
    514206|00000000||Take care, now.
    514178|00000000||Farewell.
    514176|00000000||Which girl would you recommend?
    514198|00000000||Any girl in particular you'd recommend?
    514200|00000000||You'd like Narcissa. Perhaps not the prettiest, but she's by far the most inventive. And as my dearly departed mother would say: the fun's not in the face.
    514192|00000000||So the, uh… staff hasn't changed since then?
    514194|00000000||Oh, of course it has! It does so incessantly in this business. Burly Berthie married a merchant, Ella struck out on her own, and you'll likely find Cerise praying at the Temple. I, alone, remain.
    514196|00000000||So? Shall I summon the girls? Just remember - this is a decent establishment. Paws to yourself, to start with. And our girls are well-mannered. The range of subjects they discuss in detail - I myself find it daunting.
   1070461|00000000||Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
   1071026|00000000||Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
   1071028|00000000||Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
   1071031|00000000||Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
   1071033|00000000||They await. This way, please.
   1071035|00000000||Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
   1071037|00000000||Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
   1071040|00000000||Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
   1071042|00000000||They await. This way, please.
    301010|00330572||Mage
    480652|00000000||We've a guest… who will kindly tell us what the hell he's doin' here.
    480653|00000000||Of course. See, came down here and found a corpse. There was a key on it, used it to open this door and… here I am.
    480654|00000000||Know why we ploughin' sit here on our arses all day like crippled sewer rats? Eh? To keep out snoopers.
    480683|00000000||Gettin' in here's not that hard, I guess. Leavin's another story.
    571698|00000000||Sir, leave me be, please.
    571700|00000000||Think I'm catchin' somethin'.
    571702|00000000||Ahhh… Akh akh akh!
    492119|00000000||And? He fix it for you?
    492120|00000000||No. Said I'd come to the wrong place. That he sells dumplings, now.
    492121|00000000||Jonas swore it was Hattori's handiwork. And with a warranty!
    503021|00000000||What a prick…
    400996|00000000||Plump one. Been eatin' well, that's clear… Grown fat on grain they stole from our fields!
    455837|00000000||Crows'll be the ones feastin' now. Be a week before they strip 'im to the bone.
    455839|00000000||Desist! Don't do it. I've a wife, a child!
    458985|00000000||Argh… I don't give a fuck.
   1007929|00000000||Took some mushrooms o'er to Crow's Perch - as tribute, ye know…? Well, they let me into the kitchen. The wonders I saw! Smoked sausage, venison 'aunches, cheeses large as wagon wheels, baskets full of crumpets…
   1007931|00000000||Aye! Bloody Baron don't go to bed hungry, oh no…
   1007933|00000000||Though to be frank, when I got a waft of fried eggs and bacon…
   1007935|00000000||After what we've been through… I felt a cannibal - couldn't shake the sense…
    568264|00000000||Hobnailed guards' boots. Unimportant.
    568337|00000000||A child's footprints. Damn, lots of foot traffic.
    568341|00000000||Shallow footprints, irregular stride… An old woman.
    568348|00000000||Bare feet, uneven depth. Limping beggar, most probably.
    568349|00000000||Hoofprints, clearly… A horse? Hm, no horse I know walks on two legs.
    568354|00000000||Evidence all points to Crippled Kate's.
    568359|00000000||Need to look around outside.
    568364|00000000||Empty perfume vial, expensive. Neighborhood's a bit shabby for this.
   1019318|00000000||This is it. Hm… That's not normal.
   1019317|00000000||Charmed by a succubus? Gotta get in that house, see what's inside.
    568263|00000000||Bodies were found here. Gotta look for clues, anything unusual.
    447751|00000000||That should do it. Keep close.
    447749|00000000||Tan, marvorae, cynnaeu!
    386328|00000000||What're you on about? Who said "arse"? Eh? Ugly word, ugly.
    417407|00000000||Don't cry, Yagna.
    386330|00000000||Yagna's a stupid pig.
    386332|00000000||Name-calling's not allowed.
    386338|00000000||She says when I fall asleep, rats'll come and eat my eyes!
    386340|00000000||Shouldn't say that! Apologize.
    386342|00000000||Arse.
    386344|00000000||I'll stand here till you apologize, to her and to me. I've got time.
    419977|00000000||A pesta? And did you learn how to lift the curse before you lunged at her, sword in hand?
    453167|00000000||Yeah, we talked a bit.
    459967|00000000||Looks like I need to get her beloved to the island. Fisherman named Graham.
    419981|00000000||I know the man. He lives in Oreton, village on the lakeshore.
    453169|00000000||Find him immediately. We're close to unraveling this, I can feel it.
    444956|00000000||What was that? It sounded for a moment like you'd joined the wraiths yourself…
    444958|00000000||Had to fight a pesta.
    595968|00000000||You all right?
    595980|00000000||You all right? You're conscious, but the Zanguebarian venom could still kill you.
    596026|00000000||Louis a part of this plan?
    596032|00000000||What about Louis? Was he part of this plan?
    596034|00000000||Nah, a minor complication. Ah-ahh, though his betrayal, it did get me thinking. But I had to risk it.
    596092|00000000||If you hadn't cut down every last witness, I'd be a free man. Letho of Gulet is dead - word of that woulda spread across the Continent in days.
    591548|00000000||Wouldn't 'ave done it if you'd let me in on your plan.
    591549|00000000||Told you not to get involved.
   1075952|00000000||Well, my plans in shambles. I should really disappear.
    596116|00000000||Farewell.
   1004058|00000000||You'll find a place to hide.
   1004064|00000000||Gotta be a cozy haunted house nearby. You can lay low, and no one'll bother you.
   1004066|00000000||Nah, had it with these swamps. Need a change of scenery. Zerrikania, maybe?
   1004072|00000000||I've heard they have striped horses there.
   1004073|00000000||So have I. And apparently it's a matriarchy. I mean, been a deep belief of mine always that it's women who should rule the world. Heh.
   1004074|00000000||Thanks for your help, Geralt.
   1004075|00000000||Don't mention it. See you on the Path, Letho.
    596122|00000000||So, see you at Kaer Morhen.
    596124|00000000||See you, Wolf.
    596118|00000000||Help you somehow? Need anything?
    596120|00000000||No, thanks. I'll be fine.
    596115|00000000||Need anything else?
    591551|00000000||Hmm… You could wait things out at Kaer Morhen.
   1004054|00000000||With your friends from the School of the Wolf? Hah. No, thanks, could end badly.
   1004056|00000000||Tell 'em I sent you. They'll understand, give you space.
    591552|00000000||Kaer Morhen, you say… Hmm, why not? Got some loose ends to tie up, but then I'll head there.
   1004057|00000000||You could go to Kaer Morhen.
    591550|00000000||Gotta say it's paid off. Letho of Gulet's dead as a doornail - word of that'll spread like wildfire, far and wide.
    596052|00000000||All I gotta do now's disappear.
    596028|00000000||What if he'd crossed you? Like Louis?
    596030|00000000||I had to risk it.
    596025|00000000||Weren't afraid he'd cross you?
    596010|00000000||Told you, I'd been on the run since Loc Muinne. Loads of pursuers… Got ambushed once, almost died.
    596012|00000000||So I decided it was time to end it. Once and for all.
   1004019|00000000||Found Vester's gang and paid off his arbalist. You just witnessed the rest of the story.
   1075962|00000000||Got the antidote?
   1075964|00000000||Mm, saddlebag. Take it in a minute. Couple of days, I'll be like new.
   1075966|00000000||What was it for? That whole farce.
    595971|00000000||Find this amusing?
    595976|00000000||Not so loud, Geralt. I just rose from the dead.
    595978|00000000||Zanguebarian venom could still kill you, you know.
    595967|00000000||You amused?
    591514|00000000||Mff-mff. Hm, Zanguebarian venom. Something's fishy…
    595962|00000000||Akh akh akh… You still here?
    595965|00000000||Huh. They'd 'ave cut your head off if I hadn't been here.
    591541|00000000||Hm, so you proved useful after all.
   1075954|00000000||Coulda told me.
   1075956|00000000||Heh, no fun in that.
    549321|00000000||Fine, I'll pay.
    549322|00000000||That I understand. Exemplary patriotism, mate.
    549198|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
    549334|00000000||Halt! You gotta pay the war levy!
    549335|00000000||This again?
    549336|00000000||Shut it and pay.
    549332|00000000||This keeps happening, I'll end up funding Radovid's new infantry division.
    549333|00000000||Don't you fret. Gods'll reward your patriotism.
    549315|00000000||I'll pay.
    549316|00000000||Already paid you.
    549337|00000000||Already paid. Once is enough.
    549338|00000000||Spy. Let's arrest him.
   1039436|00000000||I catch you extorting coin again, you'll go straight to the front. The eastern front.
   1039438|00000000||And you, witcher - best give these parts a wide berth.
   1040692|00000000||Thanks, farewell.
    549327|00000000||What's going on here?
    549328|00000000||Reporting the capture of a suspicious individual, sir! A spy!
    549331|00000000||A witcher'd make as good a spy as you'd make a chaperone.
    549323|00000000||Not about to give you a copper.
    549325|00000000||Told you he was a spy. We're gonna arrest you in the name of good King Radovid!
    549326|00000000||You can always try.
    549199|00000000||Sorry, not about to pay.
    549208|00000000||Where you think you're goin', mucka?
    549209|00000000||Why do you even care?
    549317|00000000||You're in a military operations zone. And our job's to collect the war tax.
    549318|00000000||Look more like you're collecting for a round of vodka to me.
    549320|00000000||I wonder, I do… Will you be that cheeky when we accuse you of spyin'? Now shut your trap and pay!
   1065552|00000000||Nilfgaardians camped here. Left in a hurry…
    473111|00000000||Well? What will you say now?! Next time I ask you to drink, will I see that grin again?!
    473113|00000000||No! No! N-Never!
    473115|00000000||I don't believe you!
    476055|00000000||Baron, sir! Colonel! Calm yourself before you burn the castle down!
    476063|00000000||You dare tell me to calm down?! You?!
    476065|00000000||If Miss Tammy saw you like this--
    476067|00000000||Don't you mention my daughter! You! You took her, didn't you?! Admit it!
    476069|00000000||I'll show you, you mangy mutt!
    518301|00000000||What is it?
    518302|00000000||We've a problem, master witcher. Mate of ours got injured, and we can't seem to find him…
    523230|00000000||Poor lad could bleed to death.
    518303|00000000||You've tracked many a monster… Would you sniff our friend out as well? We're willin' to pay.
    518314|00000000||Why not. Short delay won't hurt.
    518315|00000000||Lead the way, master witcher. Quick as you can, though - poor lad needs help.
    518316|00000000||Need some kind of lead first. Any clues?
    518317|00000000||Uh, yeah… He ran. Toward the port. Came out the sewers.
    523239|00000000||Sewers? Should be an easy scent to follow.
    518304|00000000||Why not. Let's go.
    518310|00000000||Sorry, don't have time.
    518311|00000000||Your choice. Lettin' easy coin slip through your fingers.
    518305|00000000||Don't have time.
   1048614|00000000||Oi, he's back. So, master witcher, prepared to help us after all?
    573178|00000000||Gotcha, whoreson.
    518524|00000000||That was five stone of the purest fisstech you put to the torch. Do you know what it was worth?
    518540|00000000||All right, witchman. Take your coin, bugger off.
    518543|00000000||Leave him alone.
    518544|00000000||Wonder of wonders… A witcher defendin' a mage hunter? Next we'll have mice stickin' up for cats!
    523251|00000000||I'm not joking.
    523253|00000000||Ain't you? Fine, we'll talk serious, then.
    518542|00000000||Hands off.
    518541|00000000||Do what you will.
    518545|00000000||Do what you will.
    518546|00000000||Need no convincin' there.
   1028934|00000000||The old bastion. We trained here as boys… Before the Trial of the Grasses.
   1028935|00000000||How about that… Seems the bastion's haunted.
   1028941|00000000||Wraiths? Something must've bound them to this place.
   1028954|00000000||Waste of time. Never find anything here by just looking.
   1043297|00000000||Medallion's hopping, but I can't see a thing… Maybe the lamp'll reveal more.
    451631|00000000||Why not… I am a bit thirsty.
    467940|00000000||And when a man is thirsty, melancholy strangles his soul! Pour, Gascoigne!
    451609|00000000||Gladly.
    451633|00000000||No, thanks. Don't drink with strangers.
    467942|00000000||You must not make many friends… Hard luck. But, gods keep you on your journey!
    451611|00000000||No, thank you.
    451621|00000000||Anywhere is good for that! It's simply a matter of summoning inspiration… Vodka, for example, is a great aid.
    451627|00000000||Care to drink with us? To poetry?
    453898|00000000||Curious place for a conversation about art…
    581569|00000000||Hm, well I hope your luck holds.
    417297|00000000||Out. All of yous. Blood's about to flow.
    417299|00000000||Disarm him, bind him tight.
    474801|00000000||Ostap. Six summers.
    302963|00000000||No. Think she's dead.
    302971|00000000||She definitely hid where your men said, but I arrived too late. Fortunately or not - can't really say.
    590768|00000000||There'd been a fire in the hideout. Philippa died in the flames, most likely.
    302977|00000000||A fitting end for a witch.
    302969|00000000||I know she's trying to restore her eyesight.
    302983|00000000||Wasn't where your men said, but I did find signs of someone doing medical experiments there.
    590770|00000000||Oh, that's something.
    590772|00000000||Think Philippa tried to restore her eyesight.
    303001|00000000||Verily? Empty eye sockets suit her so much better.
    302979|00000000||So. Have you any proof?
   1001586|00000000||Might've expected this.
   1001589|00000000||Yeah, should've expected as much… What else did they claim? They mention the golden dragon they slew so heroically?
   1001604|00000000||Envy speaks through you, nothing more.
    590774|00000000||No, sadly.
    302981|00000000||No. But you have my word.
    590804|00000000||Hahah, your word? You give me your word?
    303007|00000000||Sorry, but Eilhart herself taught me to doubt everyone, especially their word. So we've naught to talk about. Farewell.
   1001607|00000000||You disappoint me, witcher. Apparently, I thought too highly of you.
   1001609|00000000||Get out of my sight.
   1001588|00000000||They lied. They'd lost over a dozen men by the time I arrived. I gave the crystal to their commander - thought he'd get it to you quicker.
   1001602|00000000||Your word against theirs. And you've no proof.
   1001576|00000000||Your men lied.
   1001131|00000000||Crystal from her megascope. I gave it to your men.
   1001132|00000000||How curious. They claimed to have found it themselves. And to have saved your life when you became trapped.
    590773|00000000||I have this crystal.
    590853|00000000||Got this crystal.
   1000530|00000000||If I'd wanted a shiny bauble I would have gone to a jeweler. You were to bring me Eilhart.
    590806|00000000||This is a megascope crystal. The mages you keep imprisoned should be able to extract something from it.
    590808|00000000||Yes… At last, they might prove useful.
    590810|00000000||Not exactly what I expected, but… Very well, you've earned your pay.
    590814|00000000||Now forgive me - I've affairs to which I must attend.
    590818|00000000||No, wasn't in her hideout. But I found this crystal there.
    590760|00000000||No, but I found this crystal.
    564244|00000000||Witcher. Any progress? Have you found Eilhart?
    444265|1a9df838||Peasant
   1031843|00000000||Just like the old days…
   1031842|00000000||Stinks of piss all powerful.
   1031841|00000000||You talkin' about your ma?
    422974|00000000||Kill! Kill!
    423018|00000000||He got him! He got him!
    423085|00000000||Weakling! Let him die!
    426768|00000000||Release the hounds!
    426802|00000000||Boo-oooo!
    431016|00000000||More blood! More blood!
    426804|00000000||Want more?! Release the beasts!
    426806|00000000||We want Bo-ris! We want Bo-ris!
    426808|00000000||Shall I release Boris?
    426810|00000000||Bo-ris! Bo-ris! Bo-ris!
    426812|00000000||Especially for you, for the first time in a long time… release Boris!
    515728|00000000||So long.
    515729|00000000||Never mind. So long.
    515730|00000000||I had to win, but I don't want your family to go hungry. Here, take the purse.
    515731|00000000||That's…. Why thank you, master.
    515727|00000000||Take this coin, buy some food.
    515702|00000000||Hey, Fishgulper…
    515703|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    403775|00000000||Might be my last chance… I'm outta ideas if this don't work.
   1079398|4777d28f||Fritz
   1053230|00000000||So, the plum under your eye - who gave you that?
   1053232|00000000||Redanian soldiers, goat fucking thieves, every last one.
   1053234|00000000||Shhh… Before someone hears you…
   1053236|00000000||I'd been to the distillery, was riding back to town. Had everything - a pass, a permit, tariffs paid.
   1053238|00000000||Those damned soldiers stopped me, said they had to requisition my vodka. The war effort, they said.
   1053240|00000000||So I asked them, "Since when is getting pissed part of the war effort?" They just slapped me down and took everything.
    453469|00000000||Who… who are you?
   1084303|00000000||Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
    446307|00000000||Who's that? Show yourself! Anyone there?
    446305|00000000||Goooold! Piles of it. Won't do the dead any good now, will it?
    453467|00000000||Strange it's still here - the noble died a time ago.
   1076837|00000000||Let me out, I beg ye! Key's around here somewhere! It's gotta be!
    451163|cc663b8e||Merchant
    175639|002eaf48||Cook
    376698|00000000||Hm. Bottom of a container. Silver cylinder, most likely. Runes etched in the bottom. It's warped, probably by the explosion.
    376700|00000000||Bomb part, must be. Smells like… wyvern oil… and… caramel?
    472231|00000000||Oy oy, me good man! Would ye help me?
   1030433|00000000||I believe I shall stop coming here.
   1030435|00000000||Why? Even with the war on, they still manage to procure fine beverages.
   1030437|00000000||The liquor is the same, but the clientele is not.
   1030439|00000000||Ah, true - the rabble. They did indeed fuff about streets and yards before, rarely invading decent establishments.
   1030441|00000000||*Sigh* Hard times, indeed…
    430757|00000000||Ugh, listen.
    430759|00000000||I'm a witcher. Don't much like cities. And I downright detest crafty little imps like you and having to chase them.
    430761|00000000||As fate would have it, I gotta go to some shady dive known as the Putrid Grove. Thought I'd just walk around, ask some people, and find it.
    430763|00000000||Turns out that's not how it works.
    430765|00000000||I'm tired, and I'm angry.
    430767|00000000||So if you don't take me there, I'm gonna have to kill you.
    430769|00000000||Gulp…!
    430771|00000000||Come with me.
    430753|00000000||Take me to see him, or else…
    418444|00000000||Not sure what you're talking about.
    418446|00000000||Thought you were someone else.
    418448|00000000||Right.
    430773|00000000||All right. Wasting my time here.
    430755|00000000||Waste of time.
    342104|00000000||Need you to lead me to the alley they call the Putrid Grove.
    344789|00000000||What the hell d'you think this is? A fuckin' guided outin'? You want to find it, sniff it out yerself, you lazy prick licker.
    418442|00000000||Need to see the King of Beggars.
    418763|00000000||Walkin', walkin', always behind me walkin'. What the fuck.
   1053998|00000000||We might could go to Novigrad one o' these days…
   1054000|00000000||What for? To be robbed?
   1054002|00000000||There you go again, seein' the worst in everythin'! Nothin' happened last time we went!
   1054004|00000000||There's a mummers troupe in town, now - Madame Irina's, or somesuch. They put on plays about passionate love, revenge, jealousy and--
   1054006|00000000||Bah, I'll not watch no bleedin' mummers. Parasites, the lot of 'em. An execution, though… Oh, an execution in Hierarch Square, that I'd like to see!
   1054152|54610db3||Hound of the Wild Hunt
    515386|00000000||C'mon, folks! Ain't no one willing to fight Smithy?! There's a prize awaitin' if you win!
    515387|00000000||Smithy here's village champion! His head'd look lovely on your wall, stranger. You brave enough to try some fisticuffs?
    173985|00000000||By blood's power I summon you, with your name I beseech you.
    173987|00000000||Hear my call and arise, Dea!
    393883|00000000||Lead me to those bound to you by blood.
    466798|d34a65a7||Arachas
    420989|00000000||So long.
    420981|00000000||Farewell.
    420979|00000000||What're you offering?
    420987|00000000||Show me what you've got on offer.
    420985|00000000||Buyin' or just perusin'?
   1050810|00000000||Pot's empty again. Ye could go to the woods, cut some young bark for soup.
   1050812|00000000||To the woods? So's the shrieker can get me? No chance.
   1050814|00000000||Well then say that to the young'uns. They're cryin' from hunger!
   1050816|00000000||Better from hunger than o'er me grave.
    407044|00000000||Stand and fight!
    407042|00000000||Draw your weapon!
   1052694|00000000||Won't be easy to find mages in this mob.
   1052696|00000000||Easier than you think. You just need to set the proper bait.
   1052698|00000000||Meaning?
   1052700|00000000||Start a rumor that your father's ill, and only a potion will save him.
   1052702|00000000||It'll take some coin to spread that round.
   1052704|00000000||Don't you worry about that. His Royal Majesty's been right generous with funds for the city's cleansing.
   1086507|00000000||Hoping to play cards, actually.
    360354|00000000||So long.
    360348|00000000||Farewell.
    360346|00000000||Show me what you got in stock.
    360350|00000000||Glad to take a glance at what you got.
    360352|00000000||Of course, please do. If anything chafes or pinches, I can alter it on the spot at no charge. Once I'm done, it'll feel like you're wearing nothing at all!
    360344|00000000||Greetings. Come to look over my spring collection, perhaps?
    481869|00000000||Hurry, Geralt. This granary's cozy and all, but I'd still rather be somewhere else.
   1067712|00000000||Tell me, you were a fence in Vizima. How'd you become a cobbler?
   1067737|00000000||Picked the least suspicious profession.
   1067733|00000000||The fence thing - shite cover. Pissed too many folk off. I didn't need the attention.
   1067748|00000000||Thought about bein' an innkeep. You meet a lot of folk, you know, tossers mostly, but willlin' to talk about all sorts of things. Problem is, you're tied down like a mutt on a chain - one and the same yard all the time.
   1067750|00000000||Whereas a cobbler travels everywhere.
   1067752|00000000||Better believe it, heheh. Even cobbled together this fancy rollin' stall.
   1067755|00000000||Lovely.
   1070469|00000000||Bloody bullseye - I've made a small fortune out of it since the war started.
   1067757|00000000||Those pricks in uniform are always marchin'. Know what happens when their cocksuckin' boots disintegrate? Their feet bleed, blister up. Not a soldier out there wouldn't sell his mother for a comfy pair of combat boots.
   1067698|00000000||The cobbler thing - how'd that come about?
   1067700|00000000||So long, Thaler. And good luck.
   1070077|00000000||Oh, I can bloody use it. Radovid's one crafty whore with the clap. But we'll figure a way round that twat.
   1070129|00000000||Soon the whole fucking North'll be blatherin' about how he got fucked.
   1070133|00000000||Careful it's not also blathering about three assassins drawn and quartered.
   1070131|00000000||Heheh. Fear not, Geralt. We know what were doin'. Farewell.
   1067697|00000000||See you.
   1067696|00000000||What'll you do now?
   1067702|00000000||So what'll you do now?
   1070068|00000000||What do you mean? Head back to Novigrad. Dijkstra, Roche and I've got a master plan to set in motion.
   1070070|00000000||I'll ask again - details?
   1067704|00000000||Forgive me, mate. I ploughin' can't.
   1067706|00000000||See, were it just up to me, I'd spill it loud and proud. You're trustworthy, like no one else I know.
   1067708|00000000||But I'm not on my own, so blooming unilateral decisions are outta the question. Trap stays shut, I'm afraid.
   1067710|00000000||Right. Got you.
   1070075|00000000||And I'll be sure to tell Roche and Dijkstra how you buggered Ogg and his mates sideways. As I see it, they'll be so impressed they'll shit themselves.
   1067695|00000000||And I'll be sure to tell Roche and Dijkstra how you sliced up those dimwitted cocksuckers. As I see it, they'll be so impressed they'll shit themselves.
   1067693|00000000||Thanks again, Geralt. I'll take it from here.
   1053675|00000000||Seems to me it'd be better to leave it crooked.
   1053677|00000000||Why? It'll topple soon, it's bound to.
   1053679|00000000||Maybe soon, maybe not so soon… but till then you could make some coin off it.
   1053681|00000000||How's that?
   1053683|00000000||Gotta make a buzz 'bout the Crooked House of Novigrad. The only such marvel in the world. Folk'd pay to go in.
   1053685|00000000||Stick to carpentry, Steffen…
   1009910|00000000||Help!
   1009907|00000000||Look!
   1009905|00000000||Good day.
   1009903|00000000||Leave me alone!
    571692|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    571694|00000000||Can't polish a turd.
    571696|00000000||Never seen one like him before…
    472459|00000000||Hey! Get out 'ere!
    475674|00000000||Open up, ye codger!
    485984|00000000||Woooo! No one home!
    472461|00000000||We'll burn the shack down 'round ye!
    472468|00000000||Hey look! Some stray's wandered our way.
    472470|00000000||Sod off, freak!
    436151|00000000||Oof, so close!
    436232|00000000||The general's not only knowledgeable, but skilled. Congratulations.
    436235|00000000||Thank you. It was a good race against a worthy opponent.
    432082|00000000||Victory!
    434683|00000000||Great race. Quite the intuition, baroness.
    503502|00000000||It rarely disappoints me.
    436265|00000000||Now, could I talk to your chambermaid, m'lady?
    436273|00000000||Ah! Yes, Molly. That is why you came here, after all.
    503007|00000000||The portly young woman. That's her.
    503008|00000000||Speak to her. And you must find us when you're ready to return to Novigrad. We'd be delighted to join you for the journey.
    434663|00000000||What a thrill! A beautiful victory!
    436261|00000000||Thanks.
    503500|00000000||For one for whom every horse is a Roach, you carry yourself exquisitely in the saddle. My congratulations.
   1068045|00000000||That… is yours.
    502856|00000000||We've arrived.
    503426|00000000||We meet again, witcher.
    503428|00000000||Yeah, managed to get here. Truth be told, hard to miss an estate this grand.
    431961|00000000||My father owned a similar estate in Brugge. As a young girl, I'd travel there often to ride.
    434176|00000000||Shall we look at the horses? Do you like horses, Geralt?
    502230|00000000||I guess so. Called every horse I've had Roach.
    434946|00000000||The gray mare is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from Vole.
    502241|00000000||Gray's a nice color. For horses, too.
    434948|00000000||My coin's on the black stallion - Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian stock.
    502243|00000000||Surprised he didn't salute you, general.
    434953|00000000||Know much about the others?
    434955|00000000||Know anything about the chestnut or the bay?
    434957|00000000||The chestnut is Thunderbolt, a pureblood Redanian. Gallant steed, but too headstrong for my taste, difficult to control.
    440324|00000000||And the bay hails from Zerrikania. Lord de Volte acquired him recently. I know little about him, though Zerrikanians are reputed to have incredible stamina.
    434951|00000000||I'd like to talk to Molly.
    440143|00000000||Is Molly a horse?
    502251|00000000||Pardon?
    502253|00000000||I did come here to see Molly, after all.
    440278|00000000||Patience, witcher. She ought to arrive soon. I asked Molly to join us as soon as she was done with her chores. She shouldn't be long now.
    440322|00000000||All depends what you asked her to do, m'lady. But I don't really have a choice - I'll wait.
    435138|00000000||Know a lot about horses?
    435134|00000000||Seem to know your horses.
    434883|00000000||"Know" is not the word. Morvran's a true expert.
    435271|00000000||I find them to be far more honest than men.
    435273|00000000||Must say I'm curious how you manage in the saddle, witcher.
    502237|00000000||Mostly just try to stay in it.
    502239|00000000||What would you say to a little race?
   1068040|00000000||Not what I came here for.
   1068042|00000000||Don't make me beg, witcher. Tell you what - win, and I shall give you my finest saddle. Made in Nilfgaard proper of beautifully tanned leather.
    502259|00000000||I'd rather resolve what I have to with Molly.
    502342|00000000||Very well, I shan't insist. The attractive one - that's Molly. Speak to her. The baroness and I will place our wagers. You can then ride back to Novigrad with us if you wish.
    502255|00000000||I'd like to talk to Molly.
    502254|00000000||Let's race.
    502257|00000000||Why not. Wouldn't mind seeing if your knowledge of horses translates into riding skills.
    434297|00000000||Well said. So, which steed do you choose, witcher?
   1074249|00000000||I'll ride the Zerrikanian bay.
    431975|00000000||Heard tales of Zerrikanian horses. I'll ride the bay.
    431967|00000000||Like to give Nemrod a try.
    431973|00000000||The black's your favorite? Let's see what a Nilfgaardian stallion's made of.
    431982|00000000||I'll not race, however I will wager on a winner. The gray mare's my choice.
   1055701|00000000||Nemrod - I fear I can choose no other.
    502858|00000000||I see no point in delaying this. Let's begin.
    502435|00000000||Cantarella for me, then.
    502439|00000000||In that case, I shall try my luck on the Zerrikanian bay.
    431988|00000000||I'll not ride with you, but I shall bet on a steed. Nemrod will win, no matter the rider.
    431971|00000000||The gray mare looks nimble. Besides, knew a man named Cahir once. I'll go with her.
    431965|00000000||I'll take Cantarella.
    434492|00000000||Chestnut's my choice. Thunderbolt, yeah.
    434494|00000000||Radovid's encamped nearby. Redanian chestnut might want to impress its king.
   1055756|00000000||I had hoped to have a contest between gentlemen.
   1055820|00000000||Forgive me.
   1055758|00000000||Oh, Morvran, stop harping. Geralt, should you need to speak to Molly, she is over there, by the mounts.
   1055760|00000000||We will return to Novigrad shortly. Would you join us for the journey? We would be delighted.
   1055822|00000000||I might. Thank you.
    502846|00000000||Soothing, the scent of the freshly cut lawn.
    502847|00000000||Not all appreciate it. The races are a privilege of the wealthy.
    503420|00000000||Some of the wealthy are too occupied minding their wealth to appreciate any form of diversion.
    503422|00000000||Fortunately, you do not number among them, m'Lady.
    503424|00000000||Perhaps because the imperial army seized most of my wealth?
    510122|00000000||Tam ta ram tam tam tam.
    510123|00000000||Wanderers and vagrants by the dozen in Redania now. Know why?
    511943|00000000||Some cheat on the Temerian side's selling counterfeit passes!
    510124|00000000||Unbelievable!
    510125|00000000||Think I'd be any good at tracking down witches?
    510126|00000000||I think so.
    510127|00000000||How are things faring?
    510128|00000000||Good to see you!
    510129|00000000||Have a nice day.
    510135|00000000||Do we know each other?
    510130|00000000||Viva Radovid!
    510136|00000000||That Nilfgaardian imperror can kiss my arse.
    510131|00000000||Ah, forgive me.
    510132|00000000||Desist, let me live, sir!
    510133|00000000||Help!
    510134|00000000||Eternal Fire…
   1043909|00000000||Take your paws off my things!
   1013222|00000000||Most of us don't like humans.
   1013220|00000000||Don't bother me.
   1013244|00000000||Move!
   1013242|00000000||I don't like this game.
   1013247|00000000||I'll mince your spleen!
   1013198|00000000||What was that?
   1013196|00000000||Wait till I push you!
    594964|00000000||Stay out of trouble and we'll be dandy.
   1031520|00000000||You're a hero now. A savior! Mhmhmhmh.…
    594966|00000000||Oh, yes… our little dungeon's quite cozy.
    594968|00000000||We've such cozy stocks, padded…
    596230|00000000||Shame to let 'em rust there, unused.
    594970|00000000||Heheh, you asked for it.
    594972|00000000||May you shit in your coffin…
   1019261|00000000||Now, be a good lad. Put that back in its scabbard. Go on, I'll wait.
   1072764|00000000||Hey! You! I'm talkin' to you, grayboy!
   1072766|00000000||Mh. That's right.
   1072768|00000000||Bloody hell…
    559458|05cea138||Fiend
   1044060|00000000||"Vattier de Rideaux's Dagger."
    442264|c9c59594||Seaman
    453355|00000000||Not my intention.
    453363|00000000||I'm sorry. Didn't know it would end this way.
    453366|00000000||You're sorry? You're sorry?!
    463900|00000000||Made a mistake.
    463915|00000000||Made a mistake. Clearly chose the wrong doll.
    499064|00000000||You made a mistake? A mistake?!
    463931|00000000||You knew there were risks. You might have thought it through!
    463933|00000000||Someone had to choose.
    499100|00000000||Too damn bad that someone was you!
    463935|00000000||And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
    568960|00000000||Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not even a single tear…!
    568963|00000000||Let us leave this place.
    568966|00000000||Come to Crow Perch for your pay.
    568983|00000000||And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
    568986|00000000||Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not a single tear…!
    568989|00000000||Come. Let us go.
    453376|00000000||This might've been done differently. We could have avoided this. I'm certain of it.
    453378|00000000||Naught left for us here. We ride for Oxenfurt!
    453380|00000000||Don't cry, child. The Eternal Fire will soothe your pain. Open your heart, take comfort in its warmth.
    453395|00000000||Come to Crow Perch for your pay.
    453359|00000000||This was a cursed place. Anna herself was cursed. This is the best we could do for her. She's better off dead.
    453361|00000000||You bastard!
    453371|00000000||And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
    568818|00000000||Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not even a single tear…!
    568820|00000000||Come. Let us go.
    453353|00000000||It's better this way.
    448902|00000000||What have you done?
    453341|00000000||You were to save her! She burst into flames, hear me?! My mother burned alive!
    582135|00000000||Hah! Bloody thrashed him like a count!
    582133|00000000||Reminds me of my youth!
    582131|00000000||Do I look like a fucking witch to you?
    475179|0dd9e80e||Vampire
    436493|00000000||What's all this?
    436495|00000000||Not your concern, that's what!
    436497|00000000||You're right. So long.
    468104|00000000||You daft? That was a witcher!
    436499|00000000||Master witcher! Wait!
    436501|00000000||I'm listening.
   1037762|00000000||You're right. It's not.
   1037761|00000000||Look like you could use some help.
   1037768|00000000||Not an expert or anything, but you two look like you could use some help.
   1037774|00000000||Aye, it's true, we could.
    436503|00000000||Barn's full up with some manner of beast! Barred them inside, but that won't hold long. And we'll be in a world o' woe once they're loose!
    468109|00000000||We're not rich, but cut the filth down and we will pay you.
   1036791|00000000||Quick, master witcher! Or they'll get out!
    436507|00000000||Fine. I'll try to help you.
    436509|00000000||We'll let you in the barn, then open the doors once it's over.
    436487|00000000||Yeah. I'll help.
    436511|00000000||Sorry. Can't help just now.
    490174|00000000||Didn't I say as much?
    436489|00000000||Sorry, can't. So long.
   1036786|00000000||Master witcher! You've returned! Will you help?
    376776|00000000||Something floating on the surface… Oil, looks like…
    438064|00000000||Place is full of rats - as many dead as alive. Think they're feeding on…
    438066|00000000||Geralt, stop! You needn't be so detailed.
   1045934|00000000||Fire! The bucket! Grab the buckets!
   1045975|00000000||It's the witch! She did this!
    505114|00000000||Hey! Wait!
    542475|00000000||Can you give us any men?
    542459|00000000||Can you provide protection?
   1003165|00000000||Here we chat, while your partner's just flown the coop.
   1003166|00000000||Dammit. Hey! Wait!
   1003167|00000000||Hahahaa! Good luck!
    542461|00000000||A few of Cleaver's little shits escaped. Bugger probably already knows everythin'. I've no men to spare, can't guarantee your safety. If I was you I'd lie low for a time.
    542467|00000000||Thanks, Tinboy.
    542469|00000000||Down the line, the bosses'll make a deal… you'll be left alone. All you gotta do is stay alive till then, hahaa…
    542472|00000000||What now?
    542457|00000000||Think they'll come back?
    542474|00000000||Mean they might come back?
    534218|00000000||Right. Sure hope there's a pay-off at the end of this.
    534219|00000000||So, supplies? That something we can count on?
    534220|00000000||Who do you take me for? Gave you me word, didn't I? But I'd hire guards if I was you. You never know with Cleaver.
    464110|00000000||Nekker soup?
    464188|00000000||Putting nekkers in your soup? Is that why they got mad?
    464190|00000000||Nekkro one! Two no soup taste good. Nekkras others come, but my no call them.
    474463|00000000||Well, you put one of their brothers in the pot. It's natural they'd be a bit… upset.
    474465|00000000||Oh, they zoup want in too? Jealous is?
    474467|00000000||No, it's more like…
    474469|00000000||Many gots now. Many much for zoup. Zdew, maybe? Nekkras good as rotting. More saucy. Heh!
    359614|00000000||Ahh, to you. Man kindnice. Gift.
    359617|00000000||Kindnice man, troll help. Take. Award.
    409317|00000000||This is the head of an elf!
    409319|00000000||Elfies good. Like tometooo.
    464184|00000000||Actually talked to a ghoul once. Found him quite eloquent.
    464186|00000000||Gibbering ghoul? Nooo. That like… like cucumbra singing… or somethis.
    464118|00000000||Put anything else in the soup? No humans, I hope.
    474479|00000000||Mans? Noo… Mans some gibber interesting. Mans no gibber, go in pot.
    474481|00000000||You like talking to humans?
    464120|00000000||Yah! Nekkras, ghoulwas - done dull. No gibber at all!
    464108|00000000||Nothing else in there?
    464112|00000000||Aaah! Aa-haha. Final quiet, ha. Good time man comes, haha. Greeny near bubblegone.
    464114|00000000||Watcha got in the pot?
    464116|00000000||Zoup-ala-corpse, troll's old formily. Much goods, haha. Slinks, froggies, bonehelms… joysmell sticks!
    474361|00000000||Last - one nekkro. For flavorful.
   1011923|00000000||Got to hurry, afore the corpse eaters wamble out.
   1011925|00000000||Yeah. Looks to me an officer. Mayhap he'll have more on 'im.
   1011924|00000000||Naught on this 'un but a few crowns…
   1011927|00000000||Temerian or imperial? Actually, don't really matter. Both kinds o' corpses just as cold.
   1011926|00000000||Just hope we get outta here 'fore the corpse eaters show…
   1011922|00000000||Hah! A gold tooth!
    409080|00000000||Gonna need a new cart - gotta burn this one. Soon.
    409082|00000000||Can't I just bury the stiffs somewheres near? Cart's still fit for fixin'…
    409084|00000000||Anyone learns you carried plague victims in it, no one'll ever hire you again.
    409086|00000000||Why would they need to learn? I won't tell if you don't…
    464878|00000000||… and you'll spread the pox for miles around.
    464893|00000000||Ohh. Needs must, I suppose. Got anythin' to start a fire with?
    405257|00000000||Oughta burn your wagon.
    463683|00000000||Need to figure out the cart yourself. I gotta go.
    463685|00000000||You've helped me greatly all the same! Thanks again, and godspeed!
    464924|00000000||Now to find that daft horse, then get the stiffs back on the wagon.
    463650|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    405259|00000000||How'd the spill happen?
    405261|00000000||How'd this happen?
    409064|00000000||Axle snapped first. So, I poked me head underneath, see if I could fix it. Then outta the blue… a howl from the woods.
    409066|00000000||My mare reared as if a wolf had already clinched her hind. The cart tipped and - whoa! The cargo fell right on top me.
    467644|00000000||Your horse run off?
    405267|00000000||Aye, damn thing bolted. Ain't that my luck? If it don't rain, a wagon o' stiffs pours on me head.
    355275|00000000||They'd 'ave eaten me alive for certain. Corpses must've drawn 'em. Thank ye for not leavin' me there. Seems luck's with me atimes after all.
    405174|00000000||Luck? Guess things could be worse. You get infected recently? That why you haul corpses?
    405176|00000000||Wha? No - it's me job. Well paid, too.
    405249|00000000||Hm. Thing is, you're not a witcher or a mage, so you're not immune…
    355279|00000000||I'm no foul mutant, thank the gods, but no worries, nay! It's just, well, no illness ever holds me.
    463687|00000000||Mentioned some pox from the Black Ones?
    463689|00000000||Aye! Uh, well, they brought an illness to Velen. Treat their own, they do, while our folk drop like flies. Pfoo! Ooh - whoa! Argh, ooh I just got a waft, oh the stench!
    464944|00000000||Who blames the Nilfgaardians? Who says it's their plague?
    464946|00000000||Ealdorman of Lindenvale. 'Twere him paid me to bury these corpses - in a ditch, he says, far from the village as possible. He don't want folk panickin'.
   1028881|00000000||Not the dumbest man, no… uhh, a folk activist or somesuch.
    434586|00000000||Not one step closer! Or you'll have a lie with the other stiffs!
    358271|00000000||Getting harder to breathe…
    358273|00000000||Akh akh ugh… Dammit, can't breathe. Gotta get out while I can.
    490665|00000000||Seem to be in your element.
    490666|00000000||Still remember my elements, how I use them?
    490667|00000000||Come on, six months isn't that long. And it's not like I'm senile.
    490668|00000000||But you do have a history of amnesia.
    493191|00000000||I've recovered my memory, completely.
    493193|00000000||Good. That should stop people from taking advantage of you.
    499788|00000000||Someone's been taken advantage of me?
    499790|00000000||I have, for one.
    501310|00000000||I've never even intimated--
    499792|00000000||We need to hurry.
   1051457|00000000||Come on!
   1051459|00000000||Coming?!
   1053256|00000000||Down you go, sunshine, down, me legs're tired o' walkin', me arms're tired o' swingin',
   1053258|00000000||Head's as heavy as a rock, gut's as empty as me pots, go down, now, go down…
   1053260|00000000||If you was workin', sunshine, you'd be tired, too, you'd be settin' without me askin', go down, now, go down.
    437648|00000000||Is this necessary? On the road all day and now…?
    450055|00000000||Cram it, arsewipe.
    450057|00000000||What?! Do you know who I am? I'm Jean-Baptiste the Third - yes, of THOSE Baptistes - and…
    450059|00000000||All are equal before the Eternal Fire. And all burn the same in its flame.
    450061|00000000||Take my advice, Shaun-what's-it-rhyme-with. Shut your gob and wait in line like a good lad.
    437654|00000000||What you got there?
    450073|00000000||Dried mushrooms, sir. Come to sell 'em at market.
    450075|00000000||Huh. Any magic ones?
    450077|00000000||Nay, never. There's boletes, goatheads, penny buns… No magic mushrooms - pth! Just our own, you know, for ordinary folk.
    437641|00000000||This is scandalous! You've kept us half the day! The fruit on my cart's rotting!
    437643|00000000||Groan on like that and you'll be rottin' in the clink before the other half passes.
    450051|00000000||But… I'm a law-abiding citizen. Human ancestry traceable through generations, not a drop of elven blood!
    450053|00000000||Sure about that? Ears look a shade pointy to me… So you'd best lay 'em back.
    368184|00000000||See, Hal - bulk does what it can, but it's technique what matters most.
    493530|00000000||Hey! This flop's taken!
    493532|00000000||Best be on yer way, I'm tellin' you.
    547565|00000000||Think it was the dwarf.
    547566|00000000||What? Rubbish! Tripe! Why the hell would I do that?
    548533|00000000||Seems plausible this racist got under your skin…
    548562|00000000||But…
    547567|00000000||That's enough. Here's your pay. And you - come with me.
    547568|00000000||Can't wait to watch him swing. Someone'll have to lift him onto the stool.
    547536|00000000||The dwarf.
    547576|00000000||Prick finally got his comeuppance. I'll buy his stock for coppers on the crown.
    548653|00000000||Why'd he even do business with you if he hates dwarves so much?
    547577|00000000||Aach, he only talks tough. Wasn't at all prejudiced against dwarven coin.
    547578|00000000||So why'd he try to kill you?
    547579|00000000||Him? Bah. That fool could never plan somethin' like this. Too watery between the ears.
    547580|00000000||So long, witcher!
    547569|00000000||I think it was the man. Hates nonhumans, purest motive in the world to get rid of the dwarf.
    547570|00000000||Wha-? What motive? The scabrous freaks are colluding against me!
    547571|00000000||Sure they are. You can tell me all about it from inside your cell.
    547572|00000000||Thanks for your help. Here's your pay. C'mon!
    547537|00000000||The man.
    547524|00000000||No.
    547534|00000000||You hired me to kill the beast, not investigate.
    547535|00000000||Fair enough. It's just I'll still have to muck around in the matter. I'd have paid extra not to. Here. This is for you…
    547538|00000000||… and we’ll go to the garrison, talk to the captain. He can try to get to the bottom of this.
    548527|00000000||Found no evidence pointing either way…
    548529|00000000||Hah, no one wants evidence. If neither confesses, we'll lock 'em both up for obstructing a Guard investigation.
    547525|00000000||Found a cage. Someone'd kept a nekker in it. Bars had been sawed through, though.
    547526|00000000||So someone wanted it to escape. Which one of 'em did it?
    547523|00000000||Found a cage.
    547489|00000000||Yes.
    547490|00000000||I knew hiring a witcher'd be quickest. So - figure out how it got in there?
    547475|00000000||Yes.
    547477|00000000||Not yet.
    547478|00000000||What you been doin' in there? We're not payin' you by the hour, like some dockside whore. Hurry up! Chop, chop!
    548638|00000000||Keep out of this. The witcher'll be paid from the coffers of the Temple Guard. Just as soon as he kills the monster…
    547476|00000000||Not yet.
    547474|00000000||So? You take care of the beast?
    548560|00000000||So don't be fussy, just tell me what you think.
    358194|00000000||Well, ye did good, witcher. Here - your share for your toil.
    358192|00000000||What kind o' witcher are ye?! Call that protection?! Sorry excuse for it! Ye can forget your pay!
    181133|0599346c||Botchling
    470555|00000000||Lessy, right? Wanted to talk to your grandma.
    470557|00000000||To my… But she's been dead for years!
    470567|00000000||Guess I talked to a ghost…
    550229|00000000||Why wasn't she buried alongside her husband?
    550231|00000000||I can't say for certain, I was a little lass then. But me mum told me that shortly 'fore gran died she learned granddad had kept lovers on the side. She had no desire to lie beside him.
    544006|00000000||Seems she changed her mind. She wanted something to connect her and her husband in the afterlife… asked me for help.
    544008|00000000||Hard to believe… But you've an honest look about ye.
    550233|00000000||If you helped gran, you deserve a reward. Here. 'Tain't much, but I'm afeared it'll have to do.
    470543|00000000||I delivered the ring.
    470541|00000000||Just passing through. So long.
    470545|00000000||So long.
    470539|00000000||Witcher… What brings ye?
    577863|d84f8157||Noonwraith
    552779|00000000||Farewell.
    552776|00000000||It was an ekimmara.
    552777|00000000||Farewell.
   1007858|00000000||We didn't hire you… Still, seems you deserve a--
   1007859|00000000||You bet I do. Pay up.
   1024650|00000000||You've done well… but others hired you, said so yourself. Theys oughta pay you.
    552780|00000000||Found an ekimmara hibernating underground. It was old - must've been asleep for centuries.
   1015493|00000000||An ekimmara?
   1015495|00000000||Vampire. Won't trouble you again.
    552781|00000000||You cut off its head, drive a stake through its heart?
    552782|00000000||Did what I had to. Don't go down into those tunnels anymore. Ekimmarae aren't known to be loners.
    552778|00000000||Gods! He lives!
    403717|00000000||Akh akh… That's gotta be dwarven moonshine, too.
    403748|00000000||Strong stuff…
    403710|00000000||Dwarven moonshine - nothing stinks quite like it… There's the bottle…
    475725|00000000||Muggs was attacked here.
   1024866|00000000||See you.
   1004106|00000000||Farewell.
   1004105|00000000||How much did you pay the arbalist?
   1004100|00000000||How much did you pay the arbalist? You know, the one who "killed you"?
    596014|00000000||Not one crown. I found out there was a Ben of Kovir in Vester's band of merry men.
    596019|00000000||See, a while ago I met Ben's father, saved his life. He was a master archer from Kovir. And I'd heard Ben took after his father in that respect.
    596024|00000000||So I contacted him. We decided that if Vester ever tracked me down, Ben'd shoot me before any real fightin' broke out.
   1004102|00000000||Risky as plans go.
   1004104|00000000||Is it? Only thing I feared was someone besides Ben wanting to check if I was really dead. Or make sure I was by bashin' my skull in. But a bit of fear's a small price to pay for freedom.
   1004089|00000000||Got a minute?
   1004090|00000000||What is it?
   1007910|00000000||War - it just never changes.
   1007912|00000000||Neither do you.
   1007914|00000000||Lazy as you always been…
   1007916|00000000||What the hell am I to do? Crops're burned, they stole the cattle…
    482343|00000000||Free the children.
    402862|00000000||I shall... A word once given must be honored…
    380631|00000000||I live...
   1053758|00000000||I can sure as hell try.
   1053760|00000000||Excellent! There's an arena on the isle of Spikeroog - that's where the current Champion of Champions fights.
   1053762|00000000||I shall warn them you're on your way to issue a challenge. Farewell.
   1053755|00000000||Why not.
   1053756|00000000||Whatcha got in mind?
   1053764|00000000||Not sure I know what you mean.
   1053766|00000000||I seek someone who has what it takes to dethrone the Champion of Champions.
   1053768|00000000||A certain Skelliger now holds the title. I believe you alone stand to beat him.
   1053770|00000000||Ask yourself: am I man enough to sail to Skellige and throw down the gauntlet to the Champion of Champions?
   1053752|00000000||I've had my eye on you. Tremendous potential!
   1053754|00000000||Would you consider dropping these amateur hayseed thumps? Fighting professionally, perhaps?
   1054288|00000000||You're a good man, Geralt!
   1055658|22a35b33||Rat
    173971|00000000||Chosen a name?
    173973|00000000||No…
    173975|00000000||So think of one. It's important.
    367818|00000000||It's… it's a girl. What would Anna have named her?
    353139|00000000||Seems every time you turn around there's more scum in Novigrad.
    357523|00000000||Didn't used to allow mutants inside. Town's gone to the dogs.
    576007|00000000||Really wanna see an angry witcher?
    576008|00000000||Do you?
    576009|00000000||Damn, I look old.
   1004334|00000000||Poor Mirko… He's all alone now…
   1004335|00000000||That child! They were so happy to see it comin'.
   1004336|00000000||So it's true this vampeer kills women with child?!
   1004337|00000000||Thank the gods me man's too hungry for his knob to be stiff…
    172334|06c10782||Skellige Woman
    576495|00000000||Damned portals.
   1002392|00000000||Wonder where Keira is now.
   1037746|00000000||Show you how we fight on An Skellig!
   1037748|00000000||Thieves! Cut 'em down!
   1065564|00000000||Nilfgaardian prints again. Came this way escorting a group of barefoot… peasants?
   1065566|00000000||Or was it the other way around?
   1068521|00000000||Nilfgaardians' prints. Led a group of barefoot prisoners through here.
    486967|00000000||A letter… and a bottle.
    486969|00000000||"The wine from your birth-year - it's absolutely excellent. Startling bouquet. You absolutely must try it. But afterwards, please place the bottle back where you found it."
    492407|00000000||Your birth-year… Could be Dandelion's… or Ciri's.
   1009029|00000000||Been in Novigrad long?
   1009031|00000000||Long enough to know how not to get caught… and survive.
   1009033|00000000||And before you came here, where were you?
   1009037|00000000||Oh, places… where I managed to get by without your help, too.
   1009039|00000000||Which doesn't mean I'm not happy to see you.
   1008866|00000000||Been in Novigrad long?
   1040496|00000000||Your earring, am I right?
   1061830|00000000||Oh, my favorite earrings. I can wear them again now that I have both. Thanks, Geralt.
   1040498|00000000||Wait a second… Yes! Lost it years ago. Where did you find it?
   1040500|00000000||Kaer Morhen. In a bed. You know the one.
   1040502|00000000||Ah… yes… the good old days.
   1040504|00000000||I ever tell you you're beautiful when you blush?
   1040506|00000000||Mhm. Back then. Like I said, the good old days.
   1040494|00000000||Your earring - found it at Kaer Morhen.
   1009143|00000000||When you slit Menge's throat, and then… You were fierce. Never seen that side of you.
   1009195|00000000||What would you have had me do? Conjure up a cloud of butterflies?
   1009204|00000000||Not what I mean, and you know it. I'm a little worried how it might affect you.
   1009251|00000000||Well, yeah, I'd probably relive it in my dreams if I wasn't already having nightmares about mages roasting on pyres.
   1074679|00000000||After you killed Menge, you looked… shocked.
   1074707|00000000||Matter of that agent - still bothering you?
   1075401|00000000||Of course. Pretty damn badly.
   1075404|00000000||I don't want to be like them.
   1075406|00000000||You're not, never will be. Believe me.
   1075408|00000000||Ugh, Geralt… if you only knew what I think… what I feel when I see the next pyre… when I find the bodies of friends and adepts… massacred so badly I can't possibly identify them…
   1075411|00000000||If you knew, you wouldn't be so sure.
   1074681|00000000||The agent - that bothering you?
   1074689|00000000||Hm… Maybe we should talk about something else?
   1074691|00000000||Gladly. I was about to ask the same.
   1074686|00000000||We should change the subject.
   1074680|00000000||How's your hand?
   1074698|00000000||Been wondering - how's your hand, your fingers?
   1074700|00000000||They'll heal.
   1009139|00000000||Listen, it was my idea. I knew exactly what I was getting into.
   1013072|00000000||Don't need to worry about me.
   1008905|00000000||Feel all right?
   1075398|00000000||Hm. So-so. Why do you ask?
   1008875|00000000||How do you feel?
   1008869|00000000||Back there at the Kingfisher…
   1008871|00000000||Oh, you really want to talk about it? Maybe I should get Yennefer? Wouldn't want her to miss any of this.
   1008877|00000000||Hm, no. You're right, bad idea.
   1008867|00000000||Back there at the Kingfisher…
   1123711|00000000||So, there you were in Putrid Grove, and out of nowhere I show up. What did you think?
   1123713|00000000||Honestly? "Oh no, not him again."
   1123715|00000000||Figured as much. You weren't easy to find, you know.
   1123717|00000000||You'd recovered your memory, found Yennefer. So naturally, I thought the two of you'd--
   1123736|00000000||But it turned out my amnesia'd changed nothing. Wanted to be with you before, during, after - always.
   1123739|00000000||I know that now.
   1123985|00000000||Putrid Grove, when we first saw each other again…
   1123774|00000000||You, uh, holding up all right?
   1123776|00000000||Ugh, it'll be a hard slog for everyone…
   1123778|00000000||You know what I mean.
   1123784|00000000||What'm I supposed to say? I mean, I knew you and Yennefer… that you'd end up back together. It was a lost cause, always.
   1123786|00000000||I guess so. I just don't want you to--
   1123789|00000000||Can we not dwell on it? I need to focus on other things now.
   1123791|00000000||Right. Understood.
   1123986|00000000||Holding up all right?
   1127007|00000000||Listen, think you could help me with this mark? It's driving me crazy.
   1127010|00000000||Tsk… Oh Geralt… What've you gotten yourself into now?
   1127012|00000000||Long story. Can you get rid of this thing?
   1127014|00000000||Afraid not. And I doubt anyone else'll be able to, either. So sorry.
   1127016|00000000||Agh… Folk give me strange looks anyway. Guess I  oughta be used to it.
   1127004|00000000||My mark - help me get rid of it?
    300158|00000000||So long, Triss.
    300156|00000000||See you.
   1006925|00000000||You kept the rose of remembrance.
   1008958|00000000||See you kept the rose of remembrance I gave you in Flotsam.
   1008999|00000000||Seems so long ago… Probably because so much has changed.
   1009001|00000000||So, sentimental value… that why you kept it?
   1009009|00000000||Partly. Though… more as a warning.
    359449|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
   1000329|7d35f267||Baron's Guard
    447850|00000000||Hear that?
    447852|00000000||Been hearing it for a while. Draw your weapon.
    447885|00000000||Blast it… I kill one, another takes its place.
    452334|00000000||I know how you feel, believe me.
    447905|00000000||Where to now? Up?
    447911|00000000||Yes, it's not far now.
    447992|00000000||Let's keep looking.
    447984|00000000||Human. Wrong body type.
   1013781|00000000||That's gotta be him.
    447986|00000000||This one's a she. Remember, beards are no indicator of gender amongst dwarves.
    447988|00000000||A dwarf, but the hands… Not a carpenter's. A banker's, more likely.
    447990|00000000||Looks like necrophages got to this one.
   1069288|00000000||This isn't it.
    447926|00000000||Take the ladder.
    459498|00000000||Very well… We seek the corpse of a dwarven woodcarver.
    447972|00000000||This is the place. Come, the quicker we take care of this, the better.
   1002887|00000000||Why? Got somewhere to be?
   1002889|00000000||Someone might disturb us. The coroner, for example… or Reverend Nathaniel Pastodi.
    455093|00000000||Priscilla… how's it look? Give it to me straight, no sugarcoating.
    571018|00000000||Her wounds will heal. But it's her voice that concerns me.
    571020|00000000||Surely you understand what a terrible blow that would be to a trobairitz. Enough to strip her of the will to live.
    571024|00000000||Any remedy for that?
   1002891|00000000||I fear only your friend Dandelion can be of help on that count.
    571014|00000000||So, preventive medicine you practice in the sewers - what's that about?
    571016|00000000||Think. Sewing up drowner victims can grow awfully tedious. Is it not better to nip the problem in the bud?
   1002881|00000000||I tried to get the Temple Guard to enter the sewers. Alas, to no avail. So I took matters into my own hands.
    587921|00000000||At no charge? You damned idealists… Ruining the market for us witchers.
   1012693|00000000||Nothing good in store for us, nothing good.
   1012691|00000000||Rotten times.
   1012688|00000000||They're shedding blood!
    416639|00000000||Not from Velen - I get it right?
    416641|00000000||You did.
    416929|00000000||So where ye from?
    477054|00000000||Originally? Rivia.
    416931|00000000||Rivia! Blimey! That's a ways!
    416651|00000000||A witch lives around here somewhere. You know her?
    416653|00000000||I do. From afar, that one, like yourself. But she listens, understands. Helpful - not like the old witch. That one were deaf as a stump and mean to boot.
    416941|00000000||Know where I can find her?
    416943|00000000||Go to the pond - wild swans swam there once. Trail starts there.
    416945|00000000||Follow it to a great stone - dropped where it lies by a devil that a farmer'd tricked into thinkin' it was a giant egg. Then go right, into the woods. You'll pass a destitute cart and near it find the witch's hut.
    477058|00000000||Thanks, been a big help.
    416643|00000000||I'm looking for the witch.
    416947|00000000||Farewell.
    416647|00000000||So long.
   1051278|00000000||Oh, the Rivian again. What brings ye here?
    432008|00000000||Hm, looks like a laboratory. Pretty well equipped, too.
    582730|00000000||Yeah… Merchant traveling across Velen alone… No way that was gonna end well.
    385910|00000000||Found you. You can stop hiding.
    417339|00000000||There you are.
    417337|00000000||I can see you!
    385908|00000000||See you. Come out!
   1064939|00000000||That was close. Very close.
   1064941|00000000||It's hardly over. The envoy due to meet the Nilfgaardians tomorrow - no doubt Dijkstra ordered him killed. We'll need to protect him.
   1064945|00000000||Sorry, you're on your own. I've--
   1064947|00000000||You've had your fill of politics. I understand.
   1064949|00000000||Once it's over, come to Vizima. You'll be received with honors. Farewell, Wolf.
   1070682|00000000||That was fuckin' close!
   1064937|00000000||Bloody hell, bugger me sideways…
    425893|00000000||Know where I can get the best price on trout?
    421358|00000000||Perhaps… But it wasn't you I was to meet, sir.
    433112|00000000||Wanna talk to the letter's recipient, I gotta be present.
    433114|00000000||Caution would advise--
    433116|00000000||Caution's advising you not to argue right now. Trust me.
    433118|00000000||Seems I've got no choice. Come with me.
    469890|00000000||Where'll I get the best price on trout?
    469894|00000000||So long.
    469892|00000000||Farewell.
    469888|00000000||Yeah?
   1024103|00000000||Why do you ask?
   1024116|00000000||Why are you looking for them?
   1024117|00000000||They bad. Run from punishment. Evil only. Ill fortune.
   1024118|00000000||They here. Woman and plaetyn. Here evil and ill fortune.
   1024104|00000000||Yeah, I've seen them.
   1024186|00000000||I'm not gonna help you.
   1024192|00000000||I lie? Rydych in talf cysgod! Iddo daink!
   1024191|00000000||No idea why you're looking for them. Sorry, can't help you.
   1024189|00000000||Sorry, can't help you.
   1026100|00000000||Saw them in a cave. Nearby.
   1026102|00000000||Thank you. Take gold.
   1024190|00000000||They're in the cave.
   1024187|00000000||Sure, I've seen who you're looking for.
   1024188|00000000||Where? I gold give!
   1024185|00000000||Yeah, I've seen them.
   1024184|00000000||No, haven't seen them.
   1024114|00000000||No. Haven't seen anyone like that.
   1024115|00000000||I must find - foreign woman with plaetyn. I give gold.
   1024102|00000000||Haven't seen them.
   1024101|00000000||You see maenwod… woman and plaetyn? From far, different talk, different cloth.
   1026086|00000000||Have I seen a foreign woman? With a… plaetyn?
   1039485|00000000||Yah. That. Foreign woman. From distant parts.
   1024330|00000000||You die!
   1028061|00000000||Kadanheil! Help!
   1056485|00000000||You goes! Begonered!
   1075286|00000000||They treated us like swine! Worse!
   1062077|00000000||Enough. Leave him alone.
   1062079|00000000||Oi, you a nonhumanophile, is that it?
   1062081|00000000||On second thought, not my business.
   1062087|00000000||Forget I said anything. Not my business.
   1062089|00000000||Good!
   1073486|00000000||Gents, let's go. Believe these stinkin' elves understand they're not welcome 'ere.
   1062080|00000000||I said, leave him alone.
   1062083|00000000||If there's one think I hate, it's to repeat myself. Leave him be.
   1062085|00000000||Hey, lads! Got one eager for a lickin' 'ere!
   1073482|00000000||Let's show 'im what happens to freak lovers in Novigrad!
    594584|00000000||Yaaaawn… Yes?
    594586|00000000||Do you like it here?
    594588|00000000||My child's fallen ill. Another sleepless night.
    486034|00000000||Farewell.
    486033|00000000||Farewell.
    486032|00000000||How are things?
    486035|00000000||Not much, just riding through. How are things?
    486041|00000000||Oh, evil haunts this place, sir. Remember Hanna? The one went missin' a while past?
   1058309|00000000||Now we found her sister at the forest's edge. Torn to shreds, she were. Could barely tell it was her.
   1058311|00000000||Two days on from that Niellen wrapped a bundl, barred and locked his hut, and set off in search of contentment.
   1058597|00000000||Say where he was headed?
   1058313|00000000||No. Can't fault him, though. Knowed only sufferin' and sadness here. No wonder he wants it all behind him, and a new life somehweres else.
    592976|00000000||We found her sister at the forest's edge. Torn to shreds, she were. Could barely tell it was her.
    592978|00000000||Sorry to hear that…
    592980|00000000||T'ain't all. Niellen ventured into the woods to drive the beasts away. Three days he'd been gone, so the men assembled, went to look for him.
    592982|00000000||Found him dead in the heart of the woods, fifteen wolves round him, their throats ripped open…
    585924|00000000||Her man, Niellen, went off into the woods and hasn't come back. Sister's also gone, just up and left the village.
    593023|00000000||She say where she was going?
    593024|00000000||Didn't speak to a soul, that one. Only cried, poor girl. Got no family left here, left to seek happiness elsewhere. No wonder, really…
    486030|00000000||Greetings.
    486031|00000000||Look who the gods have led to us. What brings you here?
   1009111|00000000||Ptooey!
   1009097|00000000||Hm?
   1009103|00000000||Ptooey!
   1009101|00000000||Man!
   1009099|00000000||I'll get even with you!
    421608|00000000||Show me your wares.
    498351|00000000||Greetings.
    571674|00000000||Eh?
    571676|00000000||*Buuurrrrrp* Bwahahahahahahaa!
    571678|00000000||*Whistling*
   1014490|00000000||Listen, you're looking for a druid, I'm looking for a flower… Let's go in together.
   1014492|00000000||Why not… I could use the help of a tracker. Lead the way.
   1014477|00000000||Let's go in together.
   1015519|00000000||Think I know what drained your novices. See, there's a succubus in the forest.
   1015521|00000000||A succubus?! Gremist must have known. Yet he still sent those lads here? He risked their lives for what - a prank?
   1015523|00000000||I doubt they hold it against him.
   1015517|00000000||I think I know what drained the young druids.
   1014478|00000000||About the forest…
   1014480|00000000||What do you know about this forest?
   1014482|00000000||Not much. Funny, isn't it? A druid should know every tree, every bush…
   1014484|00000000||But even we know not to venture to some parts of the isle. We can subdue animals, but not monsters… And the word is one has made its lair here.
   1014486|00000000||A leshen? An axibrun?
   1014488|00000000||Sadly, I don't know. As I said - those who have entered do not speak of who or what they saw.
    555760|00000000||Ah… another seeker of pimpernel?
    556056|00000000||Another?
   1014474|00000000||Gremist has sent countless young druids into the forest. They emerge drained, with a blank stare… and with no flower. And they never speak of what happened.
   1014476|00000000||I've asked Gremist to stop the folly. He looked at me and laughed. But the fun's over.
   1015516|00000000||One of our novices, Ramund, has failed to return. I've come to find him. Alive or dead.
   1053273|00000000||How goes the work, my good man? Preparing for the harvest and all that, eh?
   1053275|00000000||Harvest? In springtime? Now why'd I be doin' that, sir?
   1053277|00000000||Well, what then do you do in the fields now?
   1053279|00000000||We're fixin' to gather fruit from the bushes.
   1053281|00000000||Aaaah, apples?
   1006090|00000000||So damn relieved I never became a sorceress.
   1028825|00000000||A witcher… Did the villagers hire you?
   1029666|00000000||But some time on the bugger grew greedy. He wanted more, I refused. That's when he set the witch hunters on us. Lost half me men 'cause of 'im!
   1029668|00000000||Now step aside, witcher. This ain't your affair. We want Bertram, no one else. You've my word.
   1028836|00000000||See? Quick and painless. That's for you. For understandin'.
   1028838|00000000||Let's go, gents!
   1028832|00000000||I won't get in your way. Do what you gotta.
   1028834|00000000||Right decision, witcher.
   1028829|00000000||Do what you gotta.
   1028840|00000000||Don't care much what you say. Take your men and get lost - or there'll be blood.
   1028841|00000000||Oh, there'll be blood either way. You just ensured there'll be more of it.
   1028830|00000000||Leave, or there will be blood.
   1036718|00000000||What'd Bertram do to you?
   1036720|00000000||What'd Bertram do to you to warrant vengeance?
   1036721|00000000||Haha, mean they didn't mention this bit? Then listen: he came to me a half year back. Said he'd point out who's worth lootin'… in return for a share o' the takings.
   1028826|00000000||Whatever you're planning, plan's gotta change. I can't-- won't let you hurt these people.
   1028828|00000000||I'm not here to hurt anyone 'cept that scoundrel Bertram. Came to me unbeckoned, a half year back. Said he'd betray who's worth lootin', for a share in the takings, o' course.
   1036395|00000000||Can't let you hurt them.
   1036371|00000000||Word is you got a lot in common with monsters…
   1036396|00000000||They did - to defend them from monsters. And humans who can be monsters.
   1036416|00000000||And you believe me to be such?
   1036418|00000000||Are you?
   1036423|00000000||Find out for yourself, if you dare. Or give me Bertram and no one else'll get hurt.
    492065|acfa93d4||Beggar
    594910|00000000||No room here for your kind.
    594912|00000000||Mutant.
    594914|00000000||Devil's spawn.
    594916|00000000||Get him!
    594918|00000000||You'll beg for death.
   1019253|00000000||Fucking don't anger me!
   1072744|00000000||Sheathe the steel.
   1072746|00000000||Mh. Better.
   1072748|00000000||I said, sheathe your steel.
    477959|00000000||You live here alone?
    477960|00000000||Anyone else here? Besides you?
    479333|00000000||Meaning who?
    479334|00000000||Someone who might've seen the woman.
    479335|00000000||Like the six-eyed tree?
    479336|00000000||Tree's slept all year. But there is Johnny.
    479355|00000000||Talk.
    479357|00000000||Had about enough of this.
    479359|00000000||Asked a simple question. You seen the woman or haven't you?
    479361|00000000||Fear not, children…
    479363|00000000||There's naught to fear, Gran. He's only angry 'cause he cares.
    479365|00000000||Maybe Johnny knows somethin'? I'll take 'im to Johnny, afore he goes barmy on us…
    479367|00000000||Johnny's your invention - and you shouldn't be usin' those ugly words. To the hut! Go on, now! You'll stand in a corner, I'll make sure you do.
    479369|00000000||And you stop scarin' the little ones. Now go! Begone!
    416550|00000000||A bit of help, please? A young, ashen-haired woman. Just need to know if you've seen her.
    416552|00000000||What are you looking at, children? Wash your hands, we'll go catch crickets.
    373137|00000000||Won't learn anything from you.
    373139|00000000||Aye. 'Cause I don't know nothin'.
    420334|00000000||Bet Johnny knows. He knows a lot. When I ask 'im somethin', he says: "Wait, I'll scratch my arse and tell you."
    420336|00000000||Ugly word! What're you sayin'? To the hut. You'll stand in a corner, I'll make sure you do.
    420702|00000000||You - begone. Begone.
    479354|00000000||Please help me.
    373109|00000000||Just talking to the kids. Asked them if they'd seen a young woman.
    373111|00000000||I was a lovely young woman. Wore a long, beautiful braid my mummy did up for me. Had dresses with flowers on 'em.
    373113|00000000||Maybe you've seen her. Young... Ashen hair.
    373115|00000000||Your betrothed?
    373117|00000000||Daughter, actually.
    373121|00000000||Daughter... My dear, sweet little daughter and her sister. Where are they now? Maybe they've come to some harm...?
    373099|00000000||I'm looking for someone.
    373127|00000000||Who's Johnny?
    373129|00000000||Johnny, Johnny, ate a cat, come the morn some fur he shat!
    373131|00000000||Watch your language!
    416522|00000000||They tells tales and tales. Naught but tales.
    373103|00000000||Who's Johnny?
    373133|00000000||You look after these kids?
    373135|00000000||They're my grandchildren.
    391996|00000000||Gran's good to us. Gonna be soup with scratchings for supper!
    391998|00000000||Kids get lost in the woods... I miss 'em... Seen 'em in the woods? No one has.
    373105|00000000||You take care of the kids?
    373101|00000000||Are you a witch?
    373123|00000000||You one of the witches of the swamp? I hear Crookback Bog…
    373125|00000000||Witch? Me? Nay… I've no broom, nor owl, and not one wart on me nose. Got a pretty nose. See?
    391992|00000000||Gran's got a lovely beak.
    391994|00000000||Oh, you darling girl. Kids are so sweet.
    373097|00000000||What's this talk? What kind o' jabberin' is this? Eh?
    416473|00000000||No one allowed here! Just kids. My kids, they're allowed. But who are you? Wearin' swords, like a bandit?
    373063|00000000||Listen, the girl I'm looking for, she's in trouble. I understand you might not want to help me, but you could try to help her.
    373065|00000000||How you know she was here?
    373067|00000000||I heard she visited the witches in the swamp.
    373069|00000000||But there's no witches here.
    416467|00000000||There's only frogs.
    416469|00000000||And snakes.
    416471|00000000||And Johnny.
    477927|00000000||This girl is in trouble.
    373045|00000000||A young woman got lost in the swamp. She has ashen hair and a scar on her face. You kids see anyone like that?
    373047|00000000||Ain't no lassies here.
    373049|00000000||What am I?
    401630|00000000||You're no lassie. Lassies got tits.
    415662|00000000||They do. Heard an ol' man say once, when the army was here, he says, "Hide them lasses in the woods! They's dazzlin' the soldiers with their tits, and it's torturin' the poor lads!" That's what he said.
    373037|00000000||Ever seen an ashen-haired woman around here?
    373051|00000000||What are you doing out here alone?
    373053|00000000||We's not alone, we's with Gran.
    400812|00000000||But where did you all come from?
    400814|00000000||We's orphans.
    401632|00000000||All of you?
    401634|00000000||There's a war, so there's orphans. Didn't know that?
    373041|00000000||What are you doing in the swamp?
    373039|00000000||I'm looking for a witch.
    373057|00000000||I'm looking for the witches of Crookback Bog.
    373059|00000000||You looks like a witch you'self.
    373061|00000000||The wi... witches? Of the bog?
    415664|00000000||We can't go in the bog. Gran don't let us.
    415666|00000000||When my brother Zemek went missin', Gran said it was 'cause he went in the woods and got lost. Gran cried an awful lot after that.
    415677|00000000||He could still come back.
    373033|00000000||Interesting rhyme.
    373035|00000000||Don't know you. Go away.
    416002|00000000||Dog went in the kitchen, stole a hunk of meat.
    416004|00000000||Cook gave him a lickin', strung him by his feet.
    415998|00000000||Cook then bled him empty, stripped his skin off clean.
    416000|00000000||Laughed and said, "How tasty, best sausage I have seen!"
    415992|00000000||Cook's a stupid killer, shouldn't 'ave ate the pup.
    415994|00000000||Now we'll light a fire, gonna roast him up!
    415996|00000000||One, two, three, the one to fetch the kindling's… thee!
    467297|00000000||Kill him!
    509611|00000000||There! Two more! Grab 'em!
    490066|00000000||Get her! Now!
    557002|00000000||Musk and flower pollen. Strong scent… Oughta lead me to her lair.
    557006|00000000||So that's why she's been picking all those flowers…
    557609|00000000||Who said old age is a burden?
   1071588|00000000||A chapel here? Strange idea…
   1071742|00000000||Corpses are attracting ghouls…
    516821|00000000||Lookie here, good folk! A worthy opponent for the sergeant - finally found! The winner to be named champion of all Velen!
    516823|00000000||Witcher's whooped all challengers… Who knows… Might knock you out, too.
    528062|00000000||A witcher without a sword's like a man without bollocks.
    516824|00000000||C'mon! Let 'em at it! Start the beatin'!
    516825|00000000||Don't get excited, this won't take long.
   1025572|00000000||Hey, there're mouse droppin's in this bread!
   1025574|00000000||Droppings, my eye! Those are raisins!
   1025576|00000000||So why do they smell like shit?
   1025578|00000000||How am I to know?! Perhaps your hands need washing!
   1071264|00000000||They shall kill me… kill you… kill all!
   1071682|00000000||No salvation, no escape…
   1071262|00000000||They come, they come… They shall be here soon…
   1010205|00000000||Some great hero you are.
   1010207|00000000||Beat it.
   1010202|00000000||Simpleton!
   1010200|00000000||Save yourselves!
    446402|00000000||What d'you want of me?
    451082|00000000||Anabelle needs you. Her soul will only find peace if you help her.
    451084|00000000||But… what can I do? It's too late…
    451086|00000000||Bury her bones. Anabelle should be laid to rest by one who loved her. It's the only way to lift the curse that holds Fyke Isle.
    451088|00000000||Those are… her bones?
    451093|00000000||Yes.
    451090|00000000||Give 'em here. And leave me be.
   1069953|00000000||Nothing. Let's go.
   1070558|00000000||I'm ready.
   1069950|00000000||Let's go now.
   1069955|00000000||Nothing. Meet you by the tower on Fyke Isle.
   1070590|00000000||Good. I'll await you there.
   1069951|00000000||Meet you there.
    453373|00000000||A curse has imprisoned Anabelle and the other spirits on the island. Love can shatter its power, free her and them.
    453382|00000000||Just as in the legends…
    453384|00000000||If you know the legends, you know one kiss is enough to break an evil spell. On one condition - that it's a kiss from someone whose love is true.
    453386|00000000||I told you, I said I love her with all my heart! Take me to her, please.
    496159|00000000||It's dangerous, there are risks involved. Understand that, don't you?
    496160|00000000||Course. I'm no coward, I'll not run this time.
    453343|00000000||Love can shatter the curse's power.
    453345|00000000||Anabelle thinks you've abandoned her.
    453347|00000000||Anabelle thinks you abandoned her.
    453349|00000000||Gods! She… hates me! And all this time she's thought I ran, abandoned her?
    453351|00000000||Yes. Go to the tower, talk to her. Maybe you can convince her that's not how it was.
    453357|00000000||I thought she'd died… I'd never have left her there otherwise!
    447946|00000000||Anabelle needs you. You can help her.
    447948|00000000||Is she still there… in the tower? Can I… see her?
    447952|00000000||Yeah. One thing you should know, though. In death, Anabelle turned into a pesta.
    453334|00000000||A "pester?" What's that?
    453336|00000000||More than a restless ghost. A plague maiden, a powerful wraith filled with grief and hatred that drive her, give her the power to sow disease and death.
    453338|00000000||She suffers… How am I to help her? Gods know I'm willin'.
    447938|00000000||You can still help Anabelle.
    447940|00000000||Not your fault.
    447942|00000000||It's not your fault. No guilt in not knowing - and you couldn't know it wasn't poison she drank.
    460070|00000000||Gods, what 'ave I done! If I'd a stayed behind to bury her…
    447944|00000000||I'd a noticed she was alive. It might 'ave ended different, ended well!
    460082|00000000||If you'd stayed on the island, I doubt you'd have survived.
    460084|00000000||I'd take death over leavin' her to the rats like that!
    460094|00000000||But there's naught I can do about it now!
    460096|00000000||Wrong on that count.
    447902|00000000||It wasn't poison. Anabelle drank a strong sleeping potion.
    496156|00000000||Mage wanted to protect her, make it look like she was dead. Convinced everyone.
    447907|00000000||But… that means… Is she…? You said you spoke to her.
    447916|00000000||Spoke to her ghost. By the time she awoke, tower was full of cold corpses. And rats. She was warm meat. Rats ate her alive.
    447922|00000000||You mean… she was alive the whole time? But… can't be! She was cold all through, like a corpse. I shook her, begged her, "Open yer eyes!" I never thought…
    450544|00000000||It wasn't poison Anabelle took.
    450546|00000000||What exactly did you say?
    450556|00000000||Said you were hollering as you fled the tower, the island. What exactly did you say?
    450558|00000000||I… don't remember. I wanted them to pay - for what they'd done to her!
    450560|00000000||Might've cursed them. There's a powerful magic aura on Fyke Isle. Passions, evil intent, strong emotions of any kind can activate it. Your words could be the curse's source.
    450570|00000000||She took the poison, because of them.
    446426|00000000||What happened on Fyke Isle? You gotta tell me.
    446456|00000000||Twere Millie, Finch and Faulkner - they rallied the men, all roughs, to go to the isle, take back what was ours from the noble.
    450481|00000000||They knew I was known at the tower, that the lord's servants would open the gate for me seein' as I sold them fish.
    448002|00000000||They force you to go with them?
    446462|00000000||No, I… I saw my chance in it. For Anabelle and me to flee. But… it all spun into chaos. Our boys from the village, they started killin' everyone! Anabelle, they wanted to rape!
    448021|00000000||Twere then she drank the poison. Mage must've gave it 'er. I ran out the tower, hollerin' that I wanted to die, cursin' them all to hell. Don't force me to speak of it. No more, please.
    447894|00000000||Fyke Isle - what happened there?
    447896|00000000||You loved Anabelle?
    450347|00000000||Did you love her?
    450349|00000000||Aye, somethin' mad. Loved her so deep I believed we'd come through, believed we'd be together.
    450367|00000000||Course, 'twas not to her father's likin' - his daughter and a plain lout!
    336065|00000000||Wanna talk to you about Anabelle.
    336067|00000000||Anabelle. What can you know about her?
    336069|00000000||I met her, talked to her…
    336071|00000000||Anabelle's dead. Drank poison. And I… I couldn't save her.
    446414|00000000||Here about Anabelle.
    336109|00000000||Farewell.
    446420|00000000||Farewell.
    446408|00000000||Again…? What's it you want?
    463203|00000000||I wanna talk.
    463205|00000000||You deaf, dammit? I told ye--
    463207|00000000||Who are ye?
    463316|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    463318|00000000||What of it? Why should I care?
    463283|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    463285|00000000||Been to Fyke Isle…
    463320|00000000||I've been to the island. I know what happened there.
    417185|00000000||I've cleared the way to the tower. You can get there safely, go inside. Just remember - Anabelle's--
    450595|00000000||I know, you said it already! I get it.
   1070570|00000000||All right. What're we waitin' for?
    336099|00000000||Cleared the path to the tower.
    336101|00000000||Need to warn you, this could be dangerous.
    336103|00000000||I should warn you - Anabelle's changed. She'll be different, not at all like when she was alive. Could be dangerous, in fact--
    336105|00000000||She's my Anabelle, still. I'll do anythin' to help her. I'm ready to die for her, don't care a lick.
    580412|00000000||*Hawk snort* Wha?
    580444|00000000||Argh *Cough cough cough*
    513250|00000000||Seems you've resolved your matters. It's time you returned the favor.
    513251|00000000||Radovid doesn't like to wait much, does he?
    513252|00000000||No, he does not. You'll come with us.
   1052446|00000000||That's some lovely singing.
   1052448|00000000||Better than last year. Bad enough to wither your ears, then.
   1052450|00000000||Hark the sound, yes, but the sense as well. These are no longer songs of flowery meadows.
   1052452|00000000||Through our art we speak to the state of Novigrad and what happens here today!
   1052454|00000000||We'd best be getting home, dear.
    416286|00000000||Small footprint… Johnny's been through here.
    167560|00000000||Boyadar, why you goin' 'round all sour-faced?
    174142|00000000||Argh! Thecla done made a broth of old acorns. Ugh, tastes just like barley, she said…
    174144|00000000||Any truth to that? Does it?
    174146|00000000||Nay, nothin' like it! Bitter as shite, and now it's eatin' me gut from the inside. Ugh, feels like I swallowed a horny toad.
    174148|00000000||Horny toad, roasted o'er a fire… I'd eat that.
    414895|00000000||There's your coin.
    414897|00000000||That it? We agreed on more!
    414899|00000000||Take it while I'm givin' it.
   1049511|00000000||The Palio is above all a race of honor!
   1051553|00000000||The winner doesn't just win a reward, he earns our respect as well!
   1051555|00000000||So take your positions…
   1051557|00000000||… and get the fuck goin'!
   1049783|00000000||Tain't easy to win the Palio. Better luck next year.
   1049781|00000000||Cleaver had a good hunch, recruitin' you. Congratulations.
   1085742|00000000||Merchant
   1067687|00000000||There must be someone, do you understand? Someone to help me! There must!
   1067691|00000000||There's not much we can do, mistress. If he's missin', he's missin'. Maybe they'll find 'im, maybe they won't.
   1067739|00000000||I will not wait and do nothing. We speak of my son.
   1067741|00000000||Tis a dangerous place, mistress. We'll sooner find death than your son.
   1065727|00000000||You are a fool. I shall never again take a dwarf as a servant.
   1067743|00000000||Mistress, there's not much you and me can do. But pull out your coin purse, give it a shake, might find someone willin'.
   1067746|00000000||Here's one looks like he'd do all kinds o' things for coin. Oi, mate! Talk to ye a minute?
    459376|00000000||We'll go first. Geralt will follow right after.
    459387|00000000||Saddled horses await in the stables.
    459378|00000000||Good. Meet you there.
   1073568|00000000||[Not the time for this.]
    459366|00000000||Miss Merigold! At last! So sorry we are forced to meet under such incredibly inopportune circumstances…
    510952|00000000||You can say that again.
    510956|00000000||… but I'm sure we'll make up for it another time. I absolutely must show you my alchemical formulae…
    459368|00000000||Anyone follow you?
    459370|00000000||I don't believe so.
    459372|00000000||Just in case, you two switch masks.
   1073567|00000000||[Kiss Triss.]
    421851|00000000||Hahaha! Waaaoho! Hahaha…
    425145|00000000||Careful…!
   1053294|00000000||Hey… d'you see Sabien bought a new horse?
   1053296|00000000||Mhm. A bay, eighteen hands at the withers and stronger than an ox. Could plow through stone with that'un.
   1053298|00000000||Where'd he get the gold? Wed off his daughter last, must've paid a dowry…
   1053300|00000000||To me reckonin' he's keepin' mages in his hut. And you know them. Rich buggers.
   1053302|00000000||We gotta tell the hunters! Not that I wish Sabien ill, but we just can't let filth like that live among us, pollute the village.
    421808|00000000||I sure hope the other guests don't get drunk as quickly as I did!
    425124|00000000||Sooner we get out of here, the better.
    425126|00000000||Oh, no! I plan to have a good look at this famous maze of theirs first…
    510442|00000000||I hear the statues there are completely… entirely…
    425128|00000000||Entirely what?
    425130|00000000||Nude!
    421810|00000000||Come on, Geralt!
    421812|00000000||Triss, wait!
    425138|00000000||Chase me!
    435182|00000000||Well? Hahaha. Come on!
    427029|00000000||Care to sit down for a spell?
    435184|00000000||What's that smell? Jasmine?
    435186|00000000||Ah! The garden. Let's go!
    510270|00000000||Hope Albert hasn't forgotten the reason for this whole get-together.
    459077|00000000||Wanna wait in the garden? I saw a nice spot there earlier.
    459081|00000000||Oh! Let's look around.
    459068|00000000||Let's look for Albert.
   1004892|00000000||I seen where Andrew keeps his grain. He's got a burrow near his outhouse.
   1004893|00000000||Needs to watch out. Liable to bite into his bread one day and find shit.
   1004894|00000000||We could get him drunk, sneak 'round there in the night.
   1004895|00000000||I'll not steal from me own. I'm no thief.
   1004896|00000000||Ye ain't hungry, then?
   1086143|06f95433||Mouse
   1224980|00000000||I'll cross - but I'm not gonna pay you a broken copper.
    426522|00000000||Go ahead. Try to take my coin.
    426558|00000000||See this medallion?
    426560|00000000||Uh, gaffer… gaffer!
    438543|00000000||Shut it, Sobek. Aye. Now I see it. We didn't mean no--
    426562|00000000||Recognize the guild?
    438545|00000000||Aye, master. Forgive us for not remarkin' on it earlier, please…
    438547|00000000||Gaffer! Gaffer!
    438549|00000000||Now listen. Might pass through again. Some day, dunno when. But when I do, I don't wanna run into you. That clear?
    438551|00000000||As a summer's day, m'lord! Gods speed you on your Path!
    426524|00000000||See this medallion?
    426538|00000000||Oh look, we got ourselves a customer.
    426540|00000000||Not about to buy anything from you.
    426542|00000000||Afraid you're mistaken. If we're to let you pass, you gotta pay.
    438511|00000000||And if I don't?
    438513|00000000||Heheheh, then you die.

   1071353|00000000||What's he doing here?
    459025|00000000||Albert Vegelbud?
    459027|00000000||Do I look a pathetic buffoon and mommy's boy to you?
    509774|00000000||Well…
    509776|00000000||Oh, by the gods!
    459023|00000000||No, I'm not interested in making a charitable donation. Not in the least.
    532099|2d058d06||Eternal Fire Priest
   1033686|00000000||Keeps flappin' her trap the whole damn day.
   1033689|00000000||Man don't know a moment's peace.
   1033691|00000000||Nowhere to flee, either. She follows me about, goin' on and on…
   1033717|00000000||You sheeps've got it good here - quiet, calm…
   1033719|00000000||No one talkin' your ear off.
   1072490|00000000||You help him?
    561550|00000000||Himself, or did you boys help him?
    569111|00000000||Who the fuck do you take me for, a murderer?
   1072492|00000000||He was what he was, a right bastard. But I respected him.
   1072488|00000000||Lost everythin' he cared for. No surprise he lost the will to live.
   1072518|00000000||Don't look too concerned, you and your boys.
    569113|00000000||What would you have us do - sit and wail?
   1072521|00000000||Baron was a good soldier. But settlin' in here at Crow's Perch - it made him soft. We'll introduce a new order, things'll be different now.
    569115|00000000||I imagine they will.
   1072494|00000000||Was he drunk?
   1072496|00000000||Yeah… Always knew the hooch'd be his end.
   1072489|00000000||Was he drunk?
    561548|00000000||What the hell happened?
    561549|00000000||Hanged himself. Plain enough to see.
    459863|00000000||Geralt, come back!
    584568|00000000||Phew, good work. I did not, in fact, suspect him, whereas he clearly caught on to me long ago.
   1017955|00000000||Halflings can be unpredictable.
   1017953|00000000||At any rate, we've succeeded. Now to divide the coin…
   1014997|00000000||Oh yeah, so what's this proposition that's supposed to convince me to share my winnings?
   1014999|00000000||No longer on the table. We retrieved the coin together, we shall divide it equally.
   1015045|00000000||We oughta give it back to the tournament's winner.
   1015047|00000000||Tell me you jest.
   1015049|00000000||I do. Say we split it fifty-fifty.
   1015058|00000000||Phew… Know what? Let's have dinner at the Kingfisher. My treat. To celebrate my last day in Novigrad.
   1015080|00000000||I'd love to.
   1015059|00000000||Invitation accepted.
   1015103|00000000||Got plans for the evening.
   1015105|00000000||Hah! You lie. Fine, perhaps I'll get lucky the next time we meet.
   1015107|00000000||I found the key to the storehouse on Bernard's body, so we can leave by the door. And farewell, Geralt of Rivia.
   1015063|00000000||Got other plans for the evening.
   1015064|00000000||Returning to Nilfgaard?
   1015126|00000000||Heading back to Nilfgaard? That why you needed the coin?
   1015128|00000000||I see you miss very little.
   1018147|00000000||Still got a touch of an accent.
   1018149|00000000||Ah well. It seems I shall need a new trade anyway. I'm compromised in Novigrad, so… Ehh.
   1015129|00000000||Who were you before you became a spy?
   1015139|00000000||I don't rightly remember anymore. But I suppose you can call me Cantarella.
   1015152|00000000||That your real name?
   1015154|00000000||Well, almost…
   1015062|00000000||Know what? Let's have dinner at the Kingfisher. My treat. To celebrate my last day in Novigrad.
   1015043|00000000||It's yours. You won the tournament.
   1015052|00000000||But you helped me get my prize back. We'll split it half and half.
   1031427|775f49f7||Shepherd
    535651|0e5ae9d3||Butcher
    535502|00000000||Shit!
    422009|00000000||Can you craft something for me?
    422003|00000000||Need you to craft something for me.
   1086493|00000000||Would love to play some gwent.
    498331|00000000||I'm looking for a master swordsmith.
    498333|00000000||Looking for someone who can forge an item based on a master's diagram.
    498335|00000000||Hm… No one I know. Not here in Novigrad, at any rate. Hattori - that's who'd you want if he weren't done.
    498337|00000000||Burned out, you see. He's scrunching dumplings somewhere now. I cannot say where, for I only eat at home.
    552446|00000000||Go on, Dandelion! I mean… Crimson Avenger!
    552445|00000000||Guards! Help!
    386020|00000000||No fair! I'm 'sposed to win!
    594578|00000000||Best leave now, warlock.
    594580|00000000||Do you know Mr. Menge? If you don't, you soon will.
    594582|00000000||The smell that hangs in the air… do you know it? It's burning flesh.
   1004388|00000000||Gramps, gramps! Give us a tale!
   1004389|00000000||Which one? About the fairy? Or the unicorn?
   1004390|00000000||About the lord that got eaten by mice!
   1004391|00000000||Again? Let me think on it.
    402924|00000000||Hail, good fellow! Would you be keen on helpin' me with a very important matter?
    357973|00000000||Oi! Hey there! Come 'ere!
   1011940|00000000||Ahh, so many goods gone to waste. A shame, a damn shame.

    449968|00000000||Shut up, or I'll shut you up.
    447119|00000000||For a relic, I'm pretty darn good with a sword. Know a cut where you'd bleed to death before you hit the ground.
    467581|00000000||Run out of things to say? Good.
    447115|00000000||How many people's lives have you saved? From bruxae? From leshens?
    447117|00000000||That has no bearing--
    467573|00000000||Asked you a question. How many?
    467576|00000000||There's something to think about, folks.
    449966|00000000||How many people's lives have you saved?
    467618|00000000||Waste of words, talking to you.
    467620|00000000||Then go! Begone!
    447113|00000000||Waste of words…
    467614|00000000||Got the courage to repeat that slander to my face?
    467616|00000000||Readily! You are a mutant! A freak! A useless relic of a bygone age that should be burned like a withered branch!
   1055928|00000000||Pfff, I'd heard so much about witchers' abilitiies… Turns out it's more legend than truth. As is most of Skellige.
   1055930|00000000||I don't have to explain myself to you. Fact is, nobody warned me there'd be such an onslaught.
   1055932|00000000||More's the pity.I supposed we shall need to try again. When you feel up to it, do come by again.
   1022751|00000000||Rydaw imor draeg...
   1039576|00000000||Sorry, can't let you keep that. I don't actually know who you are.
   1039553|00000000||Can't let you keep it.
   1039552|00000000||Keep it.
   1039574|00000000||Keep it. Not like I have any use for it.
   1022748|00000000||Take a look at this. Recognize it?
   1022750|00000000||Gwae fin!
   1028107|00000000||Recognize this letter?
   1022743|00000000||Sorry, can't understand a thing. Want me to take you away? Is that it?
   1022745|00000000||Helpae fi allem.
   1022746|00000000||Sorry, but I don't know what you need.
   1028108|00000000||Want me to take you away?
   1041062|00000000||Farewell.
   1028109|00000000||Farewell.
   1028106|00000000||Here's the captain's diary.
   1022738|00000000||Your language… Reminds me of the language I saw in documents from a ship.
   1022740|00000000||Recognize this? Understand?

   1022776|00000000||Clore! Aym pituna!
   1029763|00000000||Ahh. Good thing it didn't catch us along the way.
   1029767|00000000||Our townhouse… in Vizima's Trade Quarter, it has a red roof. Do you know if it still stands?
   1029765|00000000||Any news from Vizima?
   1029769|00000000||Watch it!
   1029771|00000000||Awwwrr!
   1029773|00000000||Yes?
   1029775|00000000||Don't hurt me!
    452929|f373a1e0||Foglet
    569540|00000000||I shall drink your blood.
    569544|00000000||C'mon, cut the shit.
    569559|00000000||Here I am.
    569560|00000000||Over here.
    571579|00000000||Go while you still can.
    569535|00000000||I sense your blood.
    569536|00000000||Come out and fight, bitch.
   1033858|00000000||I recommend the ebony masks from Zerrikania. Perfect for a parlor wall. Tasteful yet exotic.
   1033861|00000000||I don't know if they're all that exotic… Saw something similar at Count Winter's. Two years past.
   1033863|00000000||Well then, perhaps this totem from Velen? Complete novelty. Very folksy. You might even call it playful.
   1033865|00000000||Are those ears human?
   1033867|00000000||Please. But they do look real, don't they? Take it, play a joke on your guests!
    572817|00000000||Boo!
    572819|00000000||Scare you?
    572821|00000000||Come to toss me out again? I've been behavin'.
    572823|00000000||Haven't scared a soul.
    572825|00000000||I've not spilled soup on anyone's head, neither.
   1075592|00000000||You may still challenge Georgius Georg.
   1046683|00000000||It's no cake walk to the title of champion. More opponents await. You must defeat Georgius Georg, who reigns at the Golden Sturgeon. And also O'Neill, whom you'll find near the entrance to the slums.
   1049681|00000000||Only then will you gain the right to challenge for the title of champion of Novigrad.
   1075594|00000000||Archibald O’Neill is one you might face now.
    505985|00000000||You have earned the honor to challenge Novigrad's champion - Durden the Tailor. You will find him in Farcorners, and fight there as well, after sundown.
    505350|00000000||Geralt of Rivia dethrones Captain Mortimer! Behold your prize, champion.
    505352|00000000||Iron Mortimer remains our local champion, having handily defeated Geralt of Rivia!
   1052232|00000000||Catches're maybe half of what they used to be.
   1052234|00000000||Same for me. Goes on like this much longer, I'll have to sell me tub, pick up some other trade.
   1052236|00000000||You'd think there's some war down deep as well, with half the fish killin' the other half.
   1052238|00000000||What're you flappin' on 'bout…? Fish ain't so foolish as to kill one another.
   1008985|00000000||At your service.
   1008983|00000000||Best of health to you.
   1008981|00000000||Welcome, Geralt.
   1008979|00000000||Ah, humans, humans…
   1008959|00000000||To the hideouts!
   1010186|00000000||Ceadmil.
   1010184|00000000||Hello.
   1010182|00000000||There's something in the wind.
   1010180|00000000||Did you see that?
   1010178|00000000||Nooo!
   1014972|00000000||Ceadmil.
   1017595|00000000||"Four guardians, four flames, standing proud in a line.
   1017596|00000000||The First to light his fire dared not march on the end. The Second, by the First, played a woeful lament.
   1017597|00000000||The Third kept close to his faithful beast. The Fourth marched not beside the First, yet like the Second, played a tune.
   1021995|00000000||And thus they stood o'er their queen, who slept beneath flickering stars."
   1030836|00000000||Hm… Sounds like a riddle, all right.
   1058234|00000000||All right. Let's see if we can't solve this.
    558242|00000000||Let's try to solve it.
    558241|00000000||Repeat the inscription.
   1058236|00000000||Mind repeating the riddle?
    479590|00000000||Can you translate the inscription? I can decipher maybe a third, but that third doesn't make much sense.
   1030814|00000000||Give me a minute. I was never any good at the high variant of the Elder Speech…
   1030815|00000000||Hm, all right. This might seem a bit literal. I'm afraid I can't replicate its sophisticated internal rhymes.
   1030820|00000000||Just - translate it to make sense.
    476590|00000000||Hm, lit up like a charm.
    558178|00000000||It worked!
   1042045|00000000||How about that, you changed your mind.
   1042047|00000000||Miss me?
   1042049|00000000||Hardly. Now focus.
    558163|00000000||Looks like another damned riddle to me.
    558209|00000000||Um, seems we did something wrong.
    558235|00000000||Inscription here.
    558236|00000000||Show me!
    558310|00000000||Really similar, these statues…
    558311|00000000||Doesn't help, does it?
    558308|00000000||Let's try it. Just gotta figure out the order.
    558309|00000000||Four statues, each like the other…
   1002924|00000000||Oooh!
   1002926|00000000||Looks like some elven sanctuary…
    380939|00000000||Not in the mood.
    380951|00000000||Not in the mood.
    380953|00000000||You've two choices, witcher… Drink, or die.
    380987|00000000||No other way?
    381117|00000000||No way around this?
    381119|00000000||Of course there is. Dopplers also assume their true form when subjected to horrific pain… So I could have you flogged. Effective, true - but the goblet method is much quicker.
    381186|00000000||Now let us get down to business.
    489327|00000000||This little piggy had roast beef….
    489570|00000000||Aaayye…! You bastard… No…
    495855|00000000||This little piggy had none….
    495857|00000000||Aaa…. Aaaaa….
    380989|00000000||Your hunters are torturing Triss, but I haven't been paid.
    381176|00000000||Still haven't paid me for the witch… Yet your hunters are already torturing her.
    381178|00000000||What of it?
    381180|00000000||You're damaging goods you haven't paid for yet.
    489304|00000000||Now, let us talk shop.
    434409|00000000||Triss betrayed me first.
    434419|00000000||You seem well informed… So you have to know Triss betrayed me first - used me as a pawn in the Lodge's game. As I see it, she's getting what she deserves.
    496298|00000000||All right. So free Dandelion.
    496300|00000000||First you ask about a criminal's treasure… Now you want me to let loose a blaspheming degenerate. And here I had you for a man-- that is, a being… of some moral principle.
    496302|00000000||No doubt we're cut from different cloth. But we don't have to agree on everything to make a deal.
    496317|00000000||We need not agree any terms, either. I could simply force you to tell me what you know about Philippa.
    496319|00000000||Doubt that. I really doubt that.
    496321|00000000||Whereas I'm a man of great faith.
    426468|00000000||[DEBUG] SKIP TO CHEATING MENGE
    496039|00000000||But first let's see how Miss Merigold fares. It's… It's grown suspiciously quiet in there. Come.
    495911|00000000||So sorry I cannot be of help… Perhaps we can agree different terms?
    496315|00000000||It's simple… Free Dandelion.
    489545|00000000||A degenerate bard for information about Philippa… Tempting offer, I admit. But I must say no.
    489547|00000000||You see, I've a magnificent execution planned for Dandelion. In Oxenfurt. A breaking wheel, flaying alive and so forth… It should work wonders for the mores of the academic youth and townsfolk.
    489549|00000000||When's this morally instructive spectacle due to take place?
    489551|00000000||When I issue the order. In person. Dandelion will remain in the dungeons beneath Temple Isle until then.
    381218|00000000||Free my friend Dandelion.
    381264|00000000||Know what…? Fuck you. Had enough of this masquerade.
    381262|00000000||Fuck it. Had enough of this masquerade.
    434433|00000000||I'm looking for this treasure…
    489539|00000000||I'm looking for a treasure. Was Sigi Reuven's until recently…
    489541|00000000||Well, well… Furthering the cause of the Eternal Fire on the one hand, working for criminals on the other…
    489572|00000000||I work for whoever pays me.
    495907|00000000||Like a whore?
    495909|00000000||More or less. Just offer a different range of services. Where's the treasure?
    495910|00000000||Secure in a Koviri bank. Far and safe from you, far and safe from Reuven.
    496294|00000000||Got information about Philippa. Thought you might want to buy it…
    496296|00000000||I do. But not at any price.
    489324|00000000||No… No more… I can't…
    495851|00000000||Be brave, dear - just one more fingernail and we'll move to the other hand. This little piggy went wee, wee, wee…
    489623|00000000||Ow! Bitch bit me!
    489625|00000000||Haha! The bitch bites! Let's put a collar on her. Dimeritium ought to calm her down.
    434781|00000000||You surprise me… Geralt. Perhaps we can deal after all.
    489302|00000000||So. You know something about Philippa… But I wager you won't share this information for free. What do you want in return?
    434417|00000000||Yeah, I've ploughed Triss. But what does it matter if you're paying gold for her head?
    489567|00000000||Oh yeah… haha. Nearly forgot - the mutations strip witchers of feelings.
    434407|00000000||Witchers do anything for gold.
    434413|00000000||No idea what you're talking about…
    434415|00000000||You underestimate me. You see, I know everything about Merigold - her special talents, what she fears, who she's quarreled with, who she's shagged and who's ploughed her.
   1059600|00000000||Sensed from that start that this might be a provocation. Your inept lie just confirmed my suspicions.
    434405|00000000||Don't know what you're talking about.
    434421|00000000||Think I just changed my mind. Let her go.
    434423|00000000||Didn't take much to get you to break.
    434411|00000000||Changed my mind. Let her go.
    434372|00000000||I shall pay you twice the usual reward for Merigold.
    434374|00000000||Awfully generous. Why?
    434376|00000000||Well... you've turned in your lover. The emotional trauma it must entail… you deserve compensation.
    489306|00000000||Don't worry. You shan't leave empty-handed.
    381121|00000000||See you're an expert on dopplers.
    381123|00000000||I'd expect a witcher of all… things… to understand the value of knowing one's enemy.
    381113|00000000||Got a silver sword on my back. That not enough?
    381115|00000000||It proves nothing. Dopplers can change their bodies at will, into materials that look and feel like silver as well… Materials that have none of silver's useful properties, naturally.
    380985|00000000||Got a silver sword on my back. Not enough?
    418784|00000000||Tell them to release Triss.
    381196|00000000||Enough. Let Triss go. Now.
    381198|00000000||What? Who are you to give me orders?
    381200|00000000||A man with a sharp sword who doesn't like to repeat himself.
    380941|00000000||You can't torture Triss. I won't allow it.
    380943|00000000||Tell your boys to leave Triss alone first.
    380945|00000000||Not a chance. The bitch must howl.
    380947|00000000||I've tried to be polite. You just won't let me.
    381202|00000000||Guaaaards! In here!
    381373|00000000||There's a third option.
    381375|00000000||Oh yeah? What might that be?
    381377|00000000||I'm going to kill you.
    418794|00000000||There's a third option - I could kill you.
    418792|00000000||Fine.
    380973|00000000||Cidarian.
    418782|00000000||A 1261 vintage. Year of the massacre of Cintra.
    495847|00000000||Ah - stop squirming. Heh. This little piggy went home!
    495849|00000000||Aaah! Stop!
    380975|00000000||Kurt, please see why Miss Merigold squeals so convincingly. Perhaps she needs something? Hot irons, for instance?
    434763|00000000||Speaking of metal… this goblet's silver. Making sure I'm not a doppler?
    434765|00000000||Ah, it's immediately apparent - a professional. I find that refreshing.
    434767|00000000||But to answer your question - one can never be too careful. You'd be surprised how many who come here turn to rancid jelly as soon as they grip the goblet.
    380937|00000000||Why not.
    433855|00000000||Why?
    433857|00000000||Why the drink?
    433859|00000000||Triss Merigold has been captured… An occasion worthy of a toast, don't you think?
    380925|00000000||I believe I told you not to let anyone in.
    380927|00000000||Unless they had information concernin' Philippa Eilhart… This witcher says he's got just that.
    380929|00000000||Anyone can claim that.
    434753|00000000||We'll start with your pinky nail. Nah, let's go for your ring finger.
    495845|00000000||This little piggy went to market…
    434755|00000000||Aaaach!
    434759|00000000||But it's not that easy to bring us Triss Merigold.
    434761|00000000||Is that who I hear…? Very well. I'll go see her shortly. But first - let us talk. Sit, sit.
    446753|00000000||Have a drink, witcher.
    177293|00000000||That… that is not my child! Can't be!
    177295|00000000||You've angered it!
    173493|00000000||Shit!
    415013|00000000||Not your turn.
    437629|00000000||She cast no spells. On my honor!
    450031|00000000||An elf's honor. Worth less than a man's shit.
    450033|00000000||Tell me this: if your daughter don't do witchcraft, why'd she even have the herbs? Eh?
    450035|00000000||It's chamomile and goatweed… She brewed teas for stomach pain.
    450037|00000000||Aha! So she did make potions. Druve, make a note - her father testified.
    450039|00000000||Potions?! Are you mad?!
    450041|00000000||Shut your trap, scum… Or you'll burn alongside her.
   1041702|00000000||Geralt, bastard's gettin' away with my coin!
   1041992|00000000||Dammit, with our coin!
   1041704|00000000||Chase the whoreson! I'll tend to the others.
   1041687|00000000||Hahahah. You wish me to try? I'm not as foolish as Earl. You ought to know that by now.
   1042326|00000000||Get to work, boys. The dwarf I wish to have alive. I must have a chat with him.
   1042328|00000000||Doin' it.
   1041666|00000000||Ah, at last. I fear the body's gone cold.
   1042293|00000000||What is this?!
   1042302|00000000||Your would-be buyer handed us his coin and departed. More or less in that order. Now, the cards, please.
   1042322|00000000||I trust obtaining them wasn't too troublesome.
   1042304|00000000||Try it and find out.
   1062501|00000000||"Stinks like fiend shit" - riiiight. Old and dried out. Fiend's been around a while.
   1062436|00000000||Another trail. Tracks too small for a fiend, though.
    491071|00000000||Ahh, hahaha - it is good to see you, friend! Been a while since you were last in Novigrad. What's--
    491073|00000000||Come on. We'll talk outside.
    491033|00000000||Geralt! Must you ruin everything? I had him just where I wanted him…
    486729|00000000||Priscilla? What're you doing here?
    486734|00000000||Are you all right? You had me worried sick!
    491152|00000000||Dandelion, you rascal! Got this lass to thank for us racin' after youse. She chivvied and chivvied…!
    486741|00000000||Shame you arrived too late to see us hoodwink that hunter! I had a plan all set, but then Geralt…
    486745|00000000||Dandelion, I need to ask you something. It's important, so focus. Where's Ciri?
    486920|00000000||Ciri? I thought, seeing how you're here… You haven't seen her? I… well I don't know where she is.
    486931|00000000||I know you tried to help her.
    486932|00000000||I know you tried to help her. Gotta say I'm having trouble understanding why you went to Whoreson Junior of all people…
    486935|00000000||No one else came to mind. Maybe, given more time, I'd have done things differently, but Ciri said the Wild Hunt was on her tail.
    486937|00000000||Whoreson seemed pretty harmless by comparison.
    487003|00000000||Something went wrong…
    487005|00000000||So you've heard everything? I hope you're not mad, you can't be…
    491190|00000000||My plan was perfect… until we put it in motion. How was I supposed to know Menge was after Dudu?
    487019|00000000||Heard enough about your plan. Need to know what happened to Ciri now.
    486921|00000000||When'd you last see her?
    486966|00000000||When'd you last see her?
    486976|00000000||We were on Temple Isle, running from Whoreson's men…
    491020|00000000||Quiet! I thought I heard something.
    491022|00000000||What? No, no, no! You see, me and gags, we don't--
    491032|00000000||Mff mmmmf!
    491018|00000000||You've made a wise choice. Very wise. Might not be more than a sergeant today, but tomorrow…
    492842|00000000||Got you pretty good with that shiv.
    491976|00000000||I'll get that little shit. Teach him to step on my turf.
    491977|00000000||Put some ointment on 'er, else she'll get puffy.
    491978|00000000||Already did. Still had some salve I got off a sorceress.
    492847|00000000||You rob her?
    492849|00000000||You daft? King forbids any trickery towards mages. Needs 'em too much.
    473350|00000000||You? My apprentice? Haha, that's rich. While you're at it, why don't you ask Udalryk if he'll share Spikeroog with ye?!
    509582|00000000||I'm serious.
    509584|00000000||Is that so? Don't make me laugh. I've devoted my life to alchemy, son. Literally. Spent countless days and nights with nothing but alembics, choking on fumes, scorching my skin with acids…
    509586|00000000||If you think I'll simply betray to you what I learned through years of sacrifice and toil… then you are mistaken. Deeply.
    509601|00000000||Promise to be a good student.
    509627|00000000||I'd be a good student.
    509629|00000000||Doubtful! You can't even grasp the simple notion that I want you to leave.
    473338|00000000||Farewell.
   1009248|00000000||All right, I'll do it. But this ritual you wanna perform - what's that about?
   1009250|00000000||If you wish to be my apprentice you must stop asking questions. I decide what to tell you and when to do it. Now go. Chop chop, before I change my mind!
   1009176|00000000||I'll do it.
   1009237|00000000||This Fritjof - who is he?
   1009239|00000000||A vaedermakar - hah! You don't know the word, do you? And I pledged to make you my apprentice?
   1014283|00000000||A vaedermakar is a druid who can manipulate the weather. Stop a storm, cause hail, make lightning turn your enemy to ash. I advise to address him with the utmost respect… if you value your life.
   1009177|00000000||Fritjof? Who's that?
   1009218|00000000||Spirit - why do you need that?
   1009220|00000000||As you must know, potential apprentice, alcohol is the base for all potions. Superior alcohol means a higher quality potion. This spirit… has no equal. Its strength, its… flavor - ahh.
   1009222|00000000||Unfortunately, the distillery atop Hail Hill has fallen into disrepair - we've lacked a source ever since. But you'll manage somehow, won't you? You're so confident.
   1009178|00000000||Why do you need spirit?
   1015481|00000000||Not all that jealously. I've met it… or rather her. She gave me a pimpernel.
   1015483|00000000||Well now, not only do you parley with monsters, you can read my mind as well. We might make an alchemist of you yet…
   1015479|00000000||Forest creature jealously guarding some secrets? Sounds familiar.
   1009224|00000000||Hm. A pimpernel. Far as I know it's got no use in alchemy apart from…
   1009225|00000000||Would you teach your grandmother to suck eggs? It's not any pimpernel, but the one that grows in the Morskogen Forest. And if the rumors are true, a creature jealously guards all the herbs growing there.
   1009179|00000000||Why do you need a pimpernel?
   1009187|00000000||You're asking a lot. Let me think about it, figure out if helping you's worth the trouble.
   1009180|00000000||Lemme think about it.
   1009181|00000000||Farewell.
   1009191|00000000||Farewell.
    509602|00000000||Never mind.
    509606|00000000||Fine… Won't ask again.
    509608|00000000||Splendid resolution. I hope you have the resolve to keep it.
    509519|00000000||Mhm. Farewell, then.
   1009118|00000000||Never mind.
   1009117|00000000||Remind me…
   1009183|00000000||Wanted to ask you something…
   1009185|00000000||Not only are you as ugly as a toad, but you have the memory of a goldfish. Well, what is it?
    509630|00000000||Hmm. Though I am preparing to perform a rather tricky ritual, so I could use some help… Even yours. I require three favors. Do them for me, and I shall accept you as my apprentice.
   1008873|00000000||Well well. There's a way after all.
    509640|00000000||Get off your high horse and listen. First, you must bring me a pimpernel from the Morskogen Forest. Second, I need a bottle of spirit from the old distillery on Hail Hill.
   1008878|00000000||Finally, convince Fritjof to help me perform the rite. He's a druid, like I am. You'll find him near Blandare. I believe he's there on a matter of some import. So, what will it be?
    509623|00000000||Can I convince you somehow?
    509625|00000000||Oh gods… You're as bothersome as a gadfly before a storm.
    509600|00000000||Can I convince you somehow?
    509610|00000000||Yes, yes. You mentioned it before. And my reply remains unchanged - no.
    509604|00000000||I want you to share your knowledge, teach me alchemy.
    473336|00000000||Want you to teach me alchemy.
    509517|00000000||You seem nice.
    509521|00000000||You seem a nice enough guy.
    509588|00000000||Well, I'm not. And plan never to be.
    509590|00000000||I became a druid to avoid others, to not to have to deal with 'em. Not to smile when I don't wish to. To feign compassion when someone's travails matter less to me than a pair of birch cones.
    509592|00000000||So I shall be straight: get out of my sight. Before something - I know not what - deprives you of yours.
    473330|00000000||Wanna talk to you.
    473332|00000000||But I do not wish to speak. Leave, you distress me.
   1009189|00000000||Either agree to help me or leave.
   1009116|00000000||I've told you what you must do. Why do you still bother me?

   1040154|00000000||Use a Sign! Or bombs! Anything!
   1041265|00000000||Stay calm! They're only rats.
   1041267|00000000||I hate….! Uggggh! Rats!
    553849|00000000||Whew, thank you.
   1051996|00000000||Do you know the diseases they spread?!
   1051994|00000000||Disgusting!
   1035295|00000000||Uggggh! It's disgusting!
   1035293|00000000||Get them off! Aaaaah!
   1052013|00000000||Exterminate them, I beg you!
   1074068|00000000||Witcher, please hurry. Lift the curse that holds my mother.
   1074066|00000000||Leave me alone.
   1074064|00000000||Give me a moment. I must gather my thoughts, myself.
   1054337|00000000||Ooh, Geralt the monster slayer. I've a wild heart, care to tame me?
   1054307|00000000||Ehh, I wish my man were as brave as you… Then he'd kill monsters, collect bounties…
   1030590|00000000||They're always goin' on 'bout the Eternal Fire workin' miracles…
   1030592|00000000||Miracles, my arse! My son's dead, you understand?! Died o' the pox!
   1030594|00000000||Quiet, or someone'll hear ye and we'll both be in for it…
   1030596|00000000||For what?! My son's dead, don't you see?! And I prayed till my knees bled…

    510156|00000000||No decent woman coaxes men by danglin' her tits.
    510970|00000000||They say she's either a harlot or a witch.
    510157|00000000||It's true, I heard the same!
    510158|00000000||So will you visit your mum after all?
    510159|00000000||Sorry?
    510160|00000000||Greetings!
    510161|00000000||All praise the Eternal Fire!
    510162|00000000||Good day.
    510168|00000000||Beware the witch hunters.

    510169|00000000||The sooner our lads beat the Black Ones, the sooner they can come home.
    510164|00000000||Beg your pardon!
    510165|00000000||Mercy! Spare me!

   1032657|00000000||Always liked visiting Novigrad. A man truly feels alive here.
   1032659|00000000||Yes… Especially nice in wartime, when so many have been stripped of that feeling, deprived of life.
   1032661|00000000||The war will never arrive here. Novigrad's rulers are too prudent to allow it.
   1032663|00000000||Might be wise to settle here. We should look into real estate.
    549170|d678351e||Redanian Officer
   1074044|00000000||Need to find Johnny. He might know something.
   1074042|00000000||Charming place… Wonder what the hags did here.
   1025914|00000000||What can I get for you, m'lady? A Toussaint romance? Or perhaps a cookery tome?
   1025916|00000000||Neither. Michael of Thorn's "Compendium Artium Liberalium," please.
   1025918|00000000||Aha… For your brother, is it?
   1025920|00000000||No. For me. And don't you try to short change me, either - I also know how to count.
   1003669|00000000||You're lifeless! Move it!
   1003671|00000000||Can't seem to catch my breath.
   1003673|00000000||Think a smudger mighta been chokin' me last night…
   1003675|00000000||A smudger?! A ghost, you mean?
   1003677|00000000||Too much hooch! That's what's chokin' you!
   1065575|00000000||Draconid musk. Fresh smelling. Must've settled in around here recently.
   1065329|00000000||What's that stench?
    421500|00000000||It's beautiful here! I haven't been outside the city in ages.
   1052582|00000000||Greta, you live down by the river… It true what they say? That you can hear screams from the other side o' the Pontar at night?
   1052584|00000000||Aye… But you know… The screams aren't the worst.
   1052586|00000000||If you listen close when the moon's full, you can hear this cackle comin' from Velen… Old women laughin', but in a way that makes me shiver.
   1052588|00000000||Whenever I hear it, I shut me windows, bar me doors and sing lullabies to me kids till dawn. To keep them from hearin' it.
   1041248|00000000||Tell me everythin' later, dear.
   1041250|00000000||All right. Oh - and remember to take her some kinda offerin'.
   1040042|00000000||Heard you talking about a witch. I'd like--
   1040044|00000000||You heard wrong.
   1040046|00000000||And you've wandered too far. Meager hovels here, that's all. You should get back on the high road whence ye came.
   1040050|00000000||About that witch…
   1040052|00000000||Leave us be or I'll call me man!
    351378|00000000||Shhh… Someone's coming…
   1040157|00000000||So, gonna try to charm him? Did the witch give ye lovage?
   1039991|00000000||Aye, she did indeed. Didn't ask much for it, either.
   1039993|00000000||Maybe I should pay her a visit? How d'ye get there?
   1039995|00000000||Path past the pond - follow it till you reach a lone rock.
   1039997|00000000||Round that and head right off the path into the woods. Then keep straight.
   1039999|00000000||You'll know you've gone the right way when you pass an abandoned cart.
   1071513|00000000||Oughta be able to find the witch now.
    432004|00000000||Hm, someone dragged something across the floor.
    453515|00000000||Or dragged it from one wall to the other, repeatedly…
   1053129|00000000||Grand as feasts go, bound to be leftovers… Bring me somethin'?
   1053131|00000000||I'll be out on me arse if I'm spotted. You know that. And I've got a family to feed. Children.
   1053133|00000000||You're not alone, Jakkop. Oughta remember - you were at me son's cuttin'.
   1053135|00000000||Fine… Come to the kitchen door at midnight. Knock thrice.
    458236|00000000||Mages are more likely to succeed.
    458240|00000000||Philippa's using magic? You'd be better off sending mages after her.
    408057|00000000||I agreed to the Conclave's revival - but what has this brought me? The mages at my side are mediocrities, cowards. They can't hold a candle to the likes of Eilhart, Laux-Antille or Merigold.
    441385|00000000||There's always your witch hunters.
    441387|00000000||You are the best witch hunter. You've proven it clearly.
    441391|00000000||Síle de Tansarville's and Philippa Eilhart's plan - you were the one to foil it. I want you to finish what you started.
    408059|00000000||I cannot count on their aid. We parted ways after the events at Loc Muinne.
    441397|00000000||Parted ways…? You gathered them in one place, then gave the order to murder them.
    441399|00000000||You ignore the context. They'd assembled to revive the Conclave, the very same they had once dismantled.
    441401|00000000||I was open to the prospect. The other rulers likewise… Until a certain witcher revealed that the Lodge was behind the regicides.
    441403|00000000||The mages proved to be traitors, while the witcher proved himself skilled at tracking traitors down.
    458256|00000000||Now go to the mountains and bring me Philippa Eilhart.
    458365|00000000||Need to think about it.
    458367|00000000||Don't take too long. We wouldn't want Philippa to escape… again.
    548914|00000000||You may go.
    458234|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    458238|00000000||Why's Philippa here?
    458242|00000000||Philippa Eilhart. What's she looking for here?
    458244|00000000||I suspect she wants to find her old friends, reconvene the Lodge. Perhaps she seeks revenge, on me.
    458246|00000000||Lady Eilhart is known for her persistence. At times I recall the lessons she gave me when I was a child - her teachings as memorable as the punishments she meted out.
    458248|00000000||She was subtle and patient in her cruelty.
    458250|00000000||I took her sight, but she remains dangerous. I'd advise you to be cautious.
    427728|00000000||You've never been one to mince words. Very well. Find Philippa Eilhart - that's my wish.
    427730|00000000||I ordered her eyes gouged out once. But apparently, her blindness troubles her not.
    398631|00000000||My hunters have detected Lady Eilhart hiding east of Oxenfurt. They have further established that she has magically sealed the entrance to her shelter. Entering it will be difficult.
    427732|00000000||I believe you might succeed in doing so. Bring her to me - alive.
    513279|00000000||There you are.
    515857|00000000||Need something from me, Your Majesty?
   1044178|00000000||Understands everthin' I says, I swear it.
   1048270|00000000||It's a horse. What's more, a mare.
   1044180|00000000||But she's sharp. Trots straight to me soon as I whistle.
   1048272|00000000||Argh, fuck off.
    488917|cb934306||Dijkstra's Henchman
   1046532|00000000||Careful, you scamp. This is Novigrad, not your backarse village.
   1052258|00000000||Just so we're clear, when you lose you can't claim you don't got the coin to pay.
   1052260|00000000||First off, I won't lose to you. And second - I always pay me gamblin' debts.
   1052262|00000000||Pure reason on Jacob's part. Not more than 'fore yesterday, in this very inn, at that very table, a fellow stuck another with a knife 'cause he'd demanded his coin.
   1052264|00000000||Cards and whores - just not diversions for beggars.

   1060222|00000000||Leave me be.

   1060218|00000000||Run! Leg it!

    594562|00000000||Hm hm hm hm… LLa la la la la la la…. Hm hm hm hm hm…
    594564|00000000||Did I hang the wash or not?
   1044643|00000000||Lemme rephrase, put it in words you'll understand. Piss. Off.
   1044645|00000000||Well, well. It's not just Black Ones who'd tell us what do - it's witchers as well. Too bad I listen to neither. Get him, Lucas!
   1044640|00000000||Leave her alone. Piss off.
   1045427|00000000||Apologize and leave.
   1045441|00000000||I believe you've offended the young lady. Now apologize. As nicely as you can.
   1045443|00000000||F-forgive me, m'Lady. I… I am sorry.
   1045446|00000000||Your turn. Be nice like your friend. Bow low and go be a patriot somewhere else.
   1044647|00000000||Take the coin and go.
   1044651|00000000||If you think you can buy us like some cheap whore--
   1044653|00000000||Shut up, Lucas. Have you any idea what we can buy with this? We'll take your coin as war reparations for Nilfgaardian crimes.
   1044641|00000000||Take this coin and go.
   1050593|00000000||Far from home, aren't you, sweetie? And there's no telling if you'll ever get back.
   1044633|00000000||She's ambassador var Attre's daughter. She's got diplomatic immunity.
   1044637|00000000||Don't really understand the shite you're saying. Though it's clear you love your Black Ones.
   1044639|00000000||It's no surprise, Lucas. Witchers're drawn to monsters - just the way things are. But this beastie… Oh, we'll tend to her ourselves.
   1044621|00000000||Inn't the miss sad, here all alone? Me and my friend could join you, tell you a jest or two.
   1044623|00000000||A gallant gesture, but I must refuse.
   1044625|00000000||Oi, Kobe… You heard her speak? Our lasses don't talk like that.
   1044629|00000000||Aye, but Nilfgaardian ones do… Come to the wrong tavern, birdie. Black Ones aren't welcome here.
   1045723|00000000||Get your filthy hands off me, you wretch!
    546176|00000000||Rustling's coming from the barn.
    546178|00000000||Traps everywhere. Gotta be careful.
    553280|00000000||One less to worry about.
    553287|00000000||Akh akh. Gas of some sort…
    553502|00000000||Hole in the wall. Gotta get in there.
    553521|00000000||Hmm... a sort of attic… Gotta get up there somehow…
    554987|00000000||Problem solved.
    578400|00000000||Whoever set this knew what they were doing.
    579114|00000000||Lost him…
   1010674|00000000||Never known a monster to set a trap. Someone's here.
   1015985|00000000||Dammit! It's gonna explode!
   1075149|00000000||Well, well. A spiked pit. Took a lot of digging. Should stay clear of that.
   1075151|00000000||Booby trap… Whoever set it knew what they were doing…
    554984|00000000||Hmm… A trip wire.
    553691|00000000||Might be just long enough to reach that upper level…
    553588|00000000||A ladder…
    553305|00000000||Shit!
    507920|00000000||So, now can you craft me something extraordinary?
   1018203|00000000||Naturally. It is what we agreed. Give me a few days, then come by for your new sword.
    507915|00000000||Can you work in peace now?
    507921|00000000||Listen, would you craft something for me?
    507917|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
   1018220|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    559053|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
   1032211|00000000||Forty and a half. Still impressed. You're something of an expert, evidently.
   1032213|00000000||I'm Éibhear Hattori, former master swordsmith, currently a master of dumplings.
   1032215|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1032233|00000000||A pleasure, Geralt. How might I help you? Care to try a dumpling?
   1032217|00000000||An elven sword expert. You must be Éibhear Hattori.
   1032219|00000000||Ah, indeed. I am.
   1032221|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Heard a lot of good things about you.
    491922|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    491923|00000000||Redanian dumplings, speciality of the house! Heartily recommended!
   1032205|00000000||Blimey! A vatt'ghern in my establishment? It can't be!
   1046072|00000000||How do you know I'm a witcher?
   1046074|00000000||Are you joking? Silver blades - who else uses them? Crafted in Mahakam, am I right? Must be about forty inches long?
    491924|00000000||Greetings. How's business?
    491925|00000000||Welcome back. And thank you… not bad. How may I be of help? Care for a dumpling?
    491926|00000000||Sure. I'll try a dumpling.
    491929|00000000||Mmm. Tasty.
   1032231|00000000||Hm, glad to hear it. Anything else I can do for you?
    491927|00000000||No, thanks.
    503846|00000000||Thanks, not really hungry.
   1032235|00000000||The customer is king.
    491928|00000000||So long.
    507919|00000000||Farewell.
    507916|00000000||My sword ready?
    542448|00000000||My sword ready yet?
    507925|00000000||It is. Behold and admire. A sword to outshine all others!
   1018215|00000000||Well, this was worth the wait. Thank you, Éibhear.
   1018217|00000000||It is I who thank you. For everything.
    507924|00000000||Not quite. Come back later?
    525291|00000000||Greetings, Éibhear.
    525292|00000000||Geralt! You return safe and sound!
   1038917|00000000||I do. You doing all right?
   1038919|00000000||Never better! Once van Hoorn had finally left, Cleaver lost interest in swordsmiths. I can forge swords again without fear of my workshop going up in flames.
   1038921|00000000||Glad to hear it.
   1038923|00000000||You've no notion how glad I am! I've no need of Sukrus anymore and can devote myself to what I truly love. I thank you, witcher.
   1038925|00000000||Greetings, Éibhear.
   1038927|00000000||Greetings, Geralt. How might I be of help?
   1053320|00000000||I need somethin' for an achin' belly.
   1053322|00000000||What's ailin' ye, sweetheart? Eat somethin' overripe?
   1053324|00000000||Naye, the opposite - I've eaten nought. The hunger's so deep I can't think on me work.
   1053326|00000000||Ah… Take these leaves. Chew 'em, but don't swallow. Ye can pay me next time.
   1054612|00000000||Swords up, heave-ho!
   1054627|00000000||Smash the Black Ones, kill the foe!
   1054629|00000000||Swords back, heave-hi!
   1054631|00000000||T'day the Black Ones' heads will fly!
   1054633|00000000||Swords down, heave-out!
   1054635|00000000||Nilfgaard blood'll stream and spout!
   1054638|00000000||Slash right, slash left!
   1054640|00000000||Slash the Nilfgaard dogs to death!
   1054642|00000000||Thrust once, thrust twice!
   1054644|00000000||Nilfgaard scum will pay the price!
   1054646|00000000||Stab one, stab two!
   1054648|00000000||Give those Nilfgaard rats their due!
   1071291|00000000||None of this was your doing.
   1071293|00000000||I know… Which makes it no easier to bear.
   1071295|00000000||The pain will pass in time.
   1072427|00000000||I'd like to believe that, I would.
   1072429|00000000||You may have a moment with her… Then we must bury her and return to Novigrad.
   1072433|00000000||Very well.
   1030620|00000000||So when the bloke comes round the corner, we do the wounded man bit.
   1030622|00000000||Who's gonna do the lie down? I did the mummin' last time.
   1030624|00000000||You're best at it. Look sick already.
   1030626|00000000||Show you how ploughin' sick I am.
   1030628|00000000||Shut it, someone's comin'…
   1046168|00000000||Akh akh… Antidote's wearing out. Gotta have another dose or get out of here.
   1007603|00000000||Skugga! Svarm! Vattna halla!
   1007606|00000000||Huh. It's starting.
   1077532|00000000||[PL]
   1054323|00000000||If you ask me, all our taxes should go towards forming a squad… of witchers!
   1054325|00000000||Here, here! And not to those ne'er-do-wells from the Guard!
   1055189|10c1ddc0||Poor Townswoman
    472331|00000000||You'll give it to me willingly.
    472377|00000000||You'll give it to me… willingly.
    472379|00000000||Take one horse - that I'll allow.
    472365|00000000||No, I'll pay you for the horse. Don't care about the rest.
    472367|00000000||Hm, this horse - why is it so important to you?
    472373|00000000||Just trying to keep my word. Made a deal with its owner, that's all.
    472375|00000000||If so, take it. But I don't wish to see you here again.
    472329|00000000||No. I'll pay you for the horse.
    472381|00000000||If I have to…
    472333|00000000||If you make me…
    472321|00000000||Gotta take one of the horses back to its owner.
    472323|00000000||You sound certain, but should you be? What now? Will you kill what remains of our unit for one old nag?
    472301|00000000||One of these horses is going back to its owner.
    472319|00000000||Know the owner of one… but you probably need his horse more than he does.
    473650|00000000||Did you mean to take it? What next? Might we expect villagers with torches and pitchforks?
   1016094|00000000||Doubt they'll venture out this far. Farewell.
    472303|00000000||You need these horses more.
   1016035|00000000||So long.
   1016033|00000000||Farewell.
    472299|00000000||Need that many horses?
    472305|00000000||Need that many horses? Your light brigade planning to charge straight into Radovid's camp?
    473554|00000000||We need them to transport the wounded.
    473562|00000000||Uh-huh. Local peasants must've charged you a bundle for them.
    473564|00000000||If we could afford to purchase horses, we would not be starving.
    472297|00000000||No closer. Nothing here for you, vatt'ghern.
    327670|00000000||Hey, Bart - got a minute?
    350636|00000000||Minute? Bart no minute got. Bart rocks got. Rocks want?
    350638|00000000||I mean - a minute to talk.
    350642|00000000||You mean? Bart nice.
    378682|00000000||One more time… Can we talk?
    378684|00000000||Sigi you like. Talk me with.
    378763|00000000||What about, if you don't mind my asking?
    378765|00000000||Rocks.
    378767|00000000||Rocks?
    378769|00000000||Rocks interesting.
    378759|00000000||What about?
    378771|00000000||Didn't take you for a thinker.
    378773|00000000||Bart thinker no… Bart troll.
    378761|00000000||Don't much look like a thinker.
    378751|00000000||Why do you like Sigi so much?
    378753|00000000||Sigi good. Sigi care take Bart.
    417836|00000000||He locked you up, alone, underground. Don't get bored down here? Not much to do.
    378757|00000000||When Bart not much do, Bart think. Lots.
    327594|00000000||Why do you like Sigi so much?
    327622|00000000||Uh, thanks for your help. So long.
    378745|00000000||Hm, long, long, long.
    327614|00000000||So long.
    327596|00000000||Notice anything strange before the break-in?
    327602|00000000||Anything suspicious happen before the robbery?
    417832|00000000||Supsichous…? Bart no understand…
    417834|00000000||Something not normal. Something strange. Maybe you saw, felt, heard something…?
    350802|00000000||Yah. Yah. Bart hear… er… like… er… hiss. Hisssss.
    378775|00000000||This hissing - like a snake?
    378779|00000000||What kind of hissing was it? Like a snake?
    378781|00000000||No… Hiss other. Not animal all at.
    378783|00000000||Right. So like what?
    378785|00000000||Like… rock?
    425116|00000000||A hissing rock. Mhm.
    378777|00000000||Where'd the hissing come from?
    378787|00000000||The hissing - where did it come from?
    378789|00000000||Bart hiss hear in lavtree.
    378791|00000000||What?
    378793|00000000||Where… Where Bart turdy dump.
    396761|00000000||Let's talk about something else.
    396763|00000000||All right… Let's change the subject.
    396765|00000000||Good. Bart time got. Chorfun go. Bart guard now nothing…
    378747|00000000||Can we talk a bit more?
    378749|00000000||Bart talk will.
    497086|00000000||Witcher, there's no way out!
    497073|00000000||The King of Beggars' man - his name is Tinboy.
    511095|00000000||What do you know about him?
    534164|00000000||Not much. He's easy to ire, so tread carefully. We need him far more than he needs us.
    509037|00000000||What now?
    586472|00000000||Careful! There could be more in there!
    586473|00000000||Follow me!
    487518|00000000||Maybe hid something in his jerkin.
    496106|00000000||Damn, he's cold as ice. Nothing here.
    487513|00000000||Might be something in his jerkin.
    487520|00000000||Should check his boots.
    496108|00000000||Blood, congealed…
    487522|00000000||Key hidden in his boot.
    487524|00000000||Gotta fit a keyhole. Somewhere nearby, hopefully.
    487514|00000000||He hide something in his boots?
    487512|00000000||Should search his trousers.
    487516|00000000||Need to check his pockets.
    496104|00000000||Trousers're stiff, as if hung out to dry mid-winter.
    473684|00000000||Tortured him.
    473752|00000000||Maybe they missed something.
    526033|00000000||It's raining cats and dogs.
    526329|00000000||He wasn't killed in battle. They put him in shackles and took him to Novigrad for torment.
    526331|00000000||They ripped his entrails out with a hook, poured salt in his wounds, then dismembered him with a sword.
    526035|00000000||Duvvelsheyss, a thousand times duvvelsheyss!
    526037|00000000||Ceádmil.
    526043|00000000||You look like a dh'oine, but there's no stench of the ape about you. Why?
    526075|00000000||Gone cold with fear, pale one?
    526039|00000000||Never lose hope.
    526041|00000000||Ceádmil.
    526059|00000000||Yes?
    526045|00000000||Well.
    526047|00000000||Va caelm.
    526049|00000000||Neeeeeeen!
    526055|00000000||Is that all you've got?
    526057|00000000||Dearme.
    526077|00000000||Ugh, your stench, dh'oine!
    526051|00000000||Vedrai! Enn'le!
    526053|00000000||Who wishes to die?
    526067|00000000||Veloë! Take him from behind!
    526069|00000000||Quickly!
    526071|00000000||Watch out!
    526073|00000000||You bastard!
   1056021|00000000||Telling you for the last time. Go away.
   1056224|00000000||Ugh. Mercy! We've two children. How am I-- How're they-- Without a father?!
   1056226|00000000||Go afore they lose their mother as well.
   1056019|00000000||Stop it! He's not done anything, he's not guilty!
   1056222|00000000||We determine who's guilty. And we decide the punishment.
   1056023|00000000||He just asked for a pass… So's he could work the fields outside town…
    446636|00000000||Radovid will reopen the university just as soon as the war ends.
   1027318|00000000||I don't believe it. And even if, he'll put his men in charge, feed our youth a steady diet of propaganda.
   1043552|00000000||So how'd it go with this healer?
   1043554|00000000||I was faffin' about, mindin' me own business, when suddenly up he pops and heals me.
   1043556|00000000||Had a profitable case o' leprosy one minute, next thing I know I'm bankrupt, with no means to earn me livelihood.
   1043558|00000000||Bad luck, that. Ptooey!
    367312|00000000||Ah, oh! All right - enough! Dammit, enough! Boys, leg it!
    550881|00000000||Oy, master! Ye'll stay clear of that fog if you value your life!
   1007955|00000000||Oughta be enough. Time to cool it down.
   1018048|00000000||Now to boil the mash.
   1007957|00000000||Well well… Turns out I'm quite the distiller.
   1007949|00000000||Distilling recipes. Parchment's a little faded, but legible.
   1014674|00000000||Cyclops won't bother me anymore. Can look around peacefully now.
   1007953|00000000||Must be the filter.
   1007951|00000000||Wooden parts have rotted, metal's tarnished, dust everywhere. Doesn't seem to be broken, though.
   1008231|00000000||Got lucky. Bit of mash left.
   1075057|00000000||Ugh… Breath's downright flammable…
   1062854|00000000||Shit, lost him. Gotta look for tracks.
    171105|ba136f47||Wild Dog
   1030366|00000000||So long.
   1030364|00000000||So long.
   1030363|00000000||Whoreson Junior - tell me about him.
   1030368|00000000||What can you tell me about Junior?
   1030370|00000000||Aimin' to write his biography? Put his dad in it. "Whoreson, Son of Whoreson" - great title.
   1030372|00000000||I'm all ears.
   1030374|00000000||Whoreson Senior was the most ruthless man I've ever met. Unmatched at blackmail, murder and hustlin'. Word is he had a line on the hierarch himself.
   1030376|00000000||Junior inherited all his gaffer's traits 'cept one - his love of poetry. Senior was on his way to an evenin' recital when Junior killed him.
   1030378|00000000||Then he promptly took over all his dear daddy's businesses and contacts.
   1030362|00000000||What do you want?
   1086480|00000000||Hankerin' to play gwent.
    421121|00000000||Farewell.
    421115|00000000||Farewell.
    421113|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421119|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
    497853|00000000||Greetings.
    472898|00306a9c||Girl
    422225|00000000||Let me have a look.
    422215|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1028772|00000000||Let's play cards.
    422227|00000000||So long.
    422217|00000000||Farewell.
    498884|00000000||Know any master formulae?
    498886|00000000||Know any advanced formulae, maybe something you could teach me?
    498888|00000000||All I know I learned from Master Gremist of Skellige. Lookin' to apprentice yourself in the herbalist trade?
    498890|00000000||No, just wanna learn something new.
    498892|00000000||Call it what you will. You must sail 'cross the Great Sea, find the isle of Ard Skellig. There, in the Sacred Grove, the learned Master Gremist will judge whether you're fit to be his pupil.
    422223|00000000||Greetings! Is it herbs you seek? Medicines to mute a bashful maid's inhibitions, or a concoction to raise your own courage for a second go?
    498854|00000000||That it? No other weeds or brews?
    498856|00000000||Aye - one to make your hair grow, another to do the opposite. An easer of pain, a calmer of heartburn… Tell me what ails you.
   1042786|5bac368a||Rabid Dog
   1020884|00000000||Job's done.
   1020978|00000000||Here about the missing patrol.
   1020979|00000000||You have changed your mind? Or have you tidings?
   1027548|00000000||We will bury them with honors, as heroes. Your reward - well deserved.
   1020968|00000000||Just so happens I've been to Byways. Your patrol went there, too.
   1020969|00000000||Yes, what of them?
   1020970|00000000||They're dead. Lots of ghouls there, now, drawn by the stench of corpses. Wouldn't advise going there.
   1020972|00000000||Been to Byways. A vampire was terrorizing the village.
   1020973|00000000||This is why they did not return.
   1020974|00000000||Ekimmarae are tough, even for a group of soldiers.
   1020976|00000000||Not interested.
   1020985|00000000||Not sure it's a monster, and I don't take sides in the war.
   1020986|00000000||Ah, the famed witcher neutrality. Should you change your mind or learn anything about the missing men - you know where to find me.
   1020983|00000000||Deal. I'll see what happened to your patrol, whether there really is a monster in Byways.
   1020984|00000000||Good, good.
   1020975|00000000||I'll take care of it.
   1067313|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1067315|00000000||Need more coin. Offer's not nearly enough.
   1067317|00000000||You are mad, monster slayer. The imperial army is not the society for the protection and well-being of mutants.
   1067319|00000000||This is close to reasonable. We might yet agree.
   1067344|00000000||You know what I will tell you? You will take this job at the rate offered or try your luck somewhere else. That is my last word.
   1067342|00000000||This much we can pay.
   1020958|00000000||You must learn what happened to this patrol. The empire places great value on the lives of its soldiers. Do this, learn well what happened. The reward will be proper.
   1020906|00000000||Saw your notice. Can anyone tell me about the monster?
   1020907|00000000||I can. A patrol has been lost, somewhere along the south shore of Lake Wyndamer. We must know why.
   1020908|00000000||What makes this witchers' work?
   1020909|00000000||Some brick makers live south of here - they call their village Byways. Almost empty now, many have run away. They speak of a monster which kills.
   1024439|00000000||Redanians do not patrol there, that would be foolish. And robbers do not attack imperials - that would be even more foolish. This leaves one option - a monster.
   1020883|00000000||Here about the contract.
   1020889|00000000||Farewell.
   1020885|00000000||Farewell.
   1024267|00000000||What brings you here?
   1020844|00000000||The missing patrol - have you any news?
    543165|72eeb4b2||Herbalist
    480643|00000000||Hey, you! What the hell's afoot here?
   1056590|00000000||Wanna get rid of this hunter or not?
   1056592|00000000||Honest? We'd see you all gone, but he'll do for a start. Here. The key. Cellar door 'round the back.
   1056594|00000000||Thanks.
   1056584|00000000||Wanna get rid of this hunter or not?
   1056585|00000000||This other way, where is it?
   1056587|00000000||Where's this other way in?
   1056595|00000000||Aren't you curious? It's an ordinary tunnel, back way out in case o' trouble…
   1056597|00000000||We don't let strangers in there, show it to 'em, even! And there's--!
   1056599|00000000||Hrmph. Shut it!
    480656|00000000||What is it?
    485125|00000000||You tell me! One o' them hunters barged into our hut, turned us out 'fore we could so much as fart in protest.
    485127|00000000||There another man with him - tall, dark-haired?
    485129|00000000||Aye. Jabberin' the whole time.
    485132|00000000||Mhm, Dandelion. So, hunter's barricaded himself inside? There another way in?
    485134|00000000||Truth be told, there is…
    434982|00000000||Roasted a dog?
    467874|00000000||Must've been pretty darn hungry.
    467898|00000000||Here's some coin.
    467907|00000000||Don't have any food, but maybe this'll help.
    467926|00000000||Thank you!
    467929|00000000||Here, for you. For your kindness.
    467903|00000000||Here. Be sure to share it with the others.
    467896|00000000||Lemme give you some food.
    467918|00000000||Well, farewell. And good luck.
    467920|00000000||Good luck to you, too, master.
    467900|00000000||Farewell.
    467909|00000000||Why aren't you with your parents?
    467922|00000000||Why're you out here alone? Where are your parents?
    467924|00000000||Black 'uns killed some of them. Others kicked us out themselves. Too many mouths to feed, they said…
    467887|00000000||Come out! I'm not gonna hurt you.
    467890|00000000||When'd you last eat?
    467892|00000000||A week back. Half a charred squirrel. And a handful o' berries.
    546620|00000000||What'll we do with her, Raddy? Temple Guard oughta get her, to my mind.
    546622|00000000||Please… you know what they'll do to me.
    546624|00000000||Fine. Go. But let this be the last time I see you here, ye elf-bitch!
   1072264|00000000||On your way, go on, now. You're scarin' me other patrons off.
    477867|00000000||Transit passes at terrific prices.
    490688|00000000||Passes into Novigrad, won't find 'em cheaper anywhere else.
   1067349|00000000||Witcher Geralt… What do you want?
   1070705|00000000||Nothing just yet. Farewell.
   1070703|00000000||Nothing just now.
   1070702|00000000||An audience.
   1067393|00000000||An audience.
   1067399|00000000||Got new information about Philippa Eilhart.
   1067401|00000000||Managed to learn something about Philippa Eilhart.
   1067403|00000000||I'll need your weapons. Now follow me.
   1067405|00000000||Your Majesty… The witcher. With news of Philippa Eilhart.
   1064671|00000000||I hope you've brought something better than magic crystals this time.
   1067407|00000000||Hm, you took your time… What is it?
   1067409|00000000||I know where she is.
   1067411|00000000||Perhaps… Or perhaps you seek to trick me. Like the others.
   1064669|00000000||What others?
   1067539|00000000||What others?
   1067541|00000000||Ah, you see, a rumor went around that I generously reward any who bring information about Eilhart. There's no shortage of the greedy and the stupid, so a queue quickly formed at the gangway to the ship.
   1067543|00000000||The first to board was a hunter. Brought me a dead owl with no eyes. He thought I'd believe it, shower him with gold. I had him blinded, then thrown overboard with a stone tied round his neck.
   1067546|00000000||The second was the postmaster from Oxenfurt. Claimed to have a letter she'd penned. It was forged, of course. I had his fingers cut off - he’ll never write again. Oh, and I took his tongue - the spoken lie is just as reprehensible.
   1067549|00000000||Needless to say the rest of the queue dispersed quickly.
   1064668|00000000||I'm a professional. You can trust me.
   1064683|00000000||I'm a professional, got a reputation to uphold. Be stupid of me to come to you empty-handed.
   1064686|00000000||My father's ring… Philippa used it to stamp her decrees, then distribute them as the word of the king.
   1064707|00000000||Where is she?
   1070154|00000000||Under your nose, Sire. In Novigrad. In a house on the bridge leading to Temple Isle.
   1070160|00000000||Why haven't you brought her to me?
   1070162|00000000||Gotta capture someone to take them anywhere. All I did was track her down… then stole this ring as proof that I had.
   1070164|00000000||Do you fear her?
   1070166|00000000||No. You want to kill her yourself. With your own hands. I know this.
   1064725|00000000||You shall come with me. Hubrecht! Gather the men.
   1064729|00000000||How many, Sire?
   1064731|00000000||All of them.
   1064709|00000000||Under your nose, Sire. In Novigrad. In a house on the bridge leading to Temple Isle.
   1064711|00000000||Proof, Geralt. Give me proof.
   1064714|00000000||Don't have any.
   1064716|00000000||To the dungeon with him.
   1064719|00000000||Wait! Don't have any proof, because I didn't want to scare her off. You want to kill her… with your own hands. I know this.
   1064722|00000000||Rarely do I take folk at their word. It is unwise. However, if what you say is true…
   1067395|00000000||I've my orders - I'm not to let anyone in.
   1067397|00000000||You'll make an exception for me.
   1032864|00000000||Just this morning my Greta came back from market with news. Some mysterious murders happening in some house.
   1032866|00000000||Your Greta's got the imagination of a drunk troubadour.
   1032868|00000000||She never lies about serious matters. Some stall keeper told her the corpses were shreds.
   1032870|00000000||A stall keeper… another trustworthy source. Everyone in Novigrad wants others to listen to them. Fantastic tales are the easiest way.
   1032872|00000000||Well I believe there's something to this. You'll yet see.
   1000772|00000000||Farewell.
    446860|00000000||Farewell.
    446858|00000000||How're things at the imperial court?
   1000774|00000000||Big changes afoot in the Empire?
   1000775|00000000||You've no notion? The emperor summoned you, he only ever summons with reason. It's clear he seeks his daughter.
   1000836|00000000||You know a lot.
   1000837|00000000||I must. I am my father's son.
   1000838|00000000||What's your father got to do with this?
   1000839|00000000||Hm, he is close to the emperor… and knows the opposition, knows they press for abdication. Ceding the throne to Cirilla, it's the best the emperor can do.
   1000840|00000000||But, as is known, an empress needs an emperor at her side. My father will ensure the right man is chosen.
   1000853|00000000||Ah, Geralt. What can I do for you?
   1000761|00000000||D'you find Derghoff?
   1000764|00000000||Oh, yes. He was talking to some friends of my father. Poor chaps can't get their minds off politics, not for an instant.
   1000766|00000000||I truly hope they'll allow themselves some respite after the coronation.
    553791|00000000||Muzzle's caked in blood. Didn't give up without a fight.
    553792|00000000||Tracks're irregular here. Monster must've started staggering. Was wounded, most likely.
    553793|00000000||Blood stains. And scales.
    553794|00000000||Blood… Monster blood.
    553795|00000000||Feathers? Narrows down the list of suspects.
    553796|00000000||Tracks lead to the cave.
    553797|00000000||A cockatrice…
   1026341|00000000||Sound's coming from above…
    553790|00000000||It's wounded… won't attack. Gotta knock it off that ledge somehow.
   1037546|00000000||Your remorse - it's fake.
   1037637|00000000||Know what, Karadin? Your remorse - it's feigned. Completely dishonest.
   1037856|00000000||You put on a good show, but I just don't believe you.
   1037858|00000000||Don't even know why we bothered with this chat. We came here to kill you.
   1037548|00000000||Too late to repent.
   1037638|00000000||Maybe you've changed, maybe not. To me and Lambert, it doesn't matter.
   1037639|00000000||You killed Aiden. Fuck your new life. I don't believe in giving second chances.
   1037549|00000000||We'll leave you alone.
   1037868|00000000||We need to leave him alone, Lambert. C'mon.
   1037870|00000000||I'm not going anywhere. I came to kill this bastard.
    582689|00000000||Do what you want, Lambert. Your friend, your vengeance.
    586496|00000000||Been waiting a long time for this.
    582690|00000000||And I don't aim to die.
    582675|00000000||Kill him.
    582677|00000000||Leave him. Let's go.
    582678|00000000||You off your fucking nut?
    586490|00000000||Lambert, this is one of those situations when you have to realize you're pissed as hell, rein it in, and trust your cool-headed friend. Let's go.
   1037851|00000000||For fuck's sake, Geralt. Don't know that I'll be able to forgive you.
   1037853|00000000||I said, let's go. You can always come back.
    582679|00000000||Thank you.
    582676|00000000||Spare him.
   1037860|00000000||You've changed. You have.
   1037862|00000000||Forgiveness - it's my sole aim now.
   1037864|00000000||You're buying this bullshit? Bastard's lying his ass off!
   1037547|00000000||You've changed.
   1037871|00000000||I've heard enough.
   1037872|00000000||What now?
   1037881|00000000||Let's cut to the chase.
   1037640|00000000||Aiden - tell me your side of the story.
   1037641|00000000||What's your version of this story?
   1037642|00000000||Aiden had accepted a contract to lift the curse from the duke's daughter. He took the coin, bungled the job, then left once the girl passed on.
   1037643|00000000||You lie.
   1037644|00000000||We were not to kill him - we were debt collectors. He'd spent the coin already, so we demanded his swords.
   1037878|00000000||When he refused, tempers flared. Vienne, positioned as a sniper, lost her nerve. Hit Aiden square in the eye.
   1037880|00000000||Later, she devised her own version of the story. To silence her guilt, I expect.
   1005230|00000000||Remember Aiden? A witcher. Murdered in Ellander. Guessing the killers were paid well.
   1005232|00000000||I remember him as I remember all the others - with the deepest regret.
   1037545|00000000||Yet Aiden was different in a way. Contrary to rumor we did not set out to kill him. We were forced to, when he attacked us.
   1005227|00000000||Remember a witcher named Aiden?
   1037522|00000000||Nice place you got.
   1037523|00000000||As it turned out, I've a flair for enterprise. Now I've coin enough to provide my family with the finer things in life.
   1037533|00000000||With some leftover for philanthropy.
   1037535|00000000||Miss Marabella's institute does not scorn small donations. Neither does the city's Widows' and Orphans' Relief Fund, amongst others.
   1037517|00000000||Nice house.
   1005228|00000000||Your wife know about your past?
   1005234|00000000||Your wife know who you were?
   1005236|00000000||We are thoroughly honest with one another, harbor no secrets. She prays for me each day. You know what? I think it's working.
   1005240|00000000||Fucking hell.
   1037519|00000000||Relax, Lambert.
   1037521|00000000||I confessed all just before we pledged to marry one another. Began a new life that day, with a clean slate.
   1005224|00000000||I'm all ears.
   1004417|00000000||Talk to him Geralt. If I do, first word he says to me, I'll lose it and throttle the fucker.
    447725|00000000||Lovely. No wonder there were so many rats.
    447727|00000000||Who's tossing all these corpses down here?
    450793|00000000||We're right under the main square. Next to Carlo 'The Cleaver' Varese's headquarters. Can't be a coincidence.
    450795|00000000||His debtors have tended to disappear without a trace.
    576747|00000000||That's all I have. Had a loaf of bread, too, but I dropped it, decided not to go back.
    576748|00000000||Wise choice. If anything happened to you, we'd go hungry…
    594554|00000000||A witcher. We're in for it now.
    594556|00000000||How will you make a living? We've no monsters!
    594558|00000000||What's it like? Beheading a king?
    496956|00000000||Hehe, boys're givin' it good.
    496955|00000000||Won't soon forget that whallopin'!
   1004184|00000000||Gloriel's still unwell… Head's hot as a hearth… And she's seein' things.
   1004185|00000000||Oughta take her into the swamp… to see the sisters.
   1004186|00000000||And how would I repay them? You know I've been eatin' bark broth since the new moon…
   1004187|00000000||Sisters don't want food.
   1004188|00000000||What, then?
   1004189|00000000||You'll see.
    501559|00000000||Nooooo!
    501560|00000000||I'll kill ye… I'll kill all you whoresons!
    501561|00000000||Leave it! Or they'll cut ye down, too…
    477892|00000000||Interest you in a pass? Cheapest around, right here.
    490764|00000000||What kind of pass are we talking about?
    490765|00000000||You don't know? Redanians hold all the fords 'cross the Pontar. Can't get through without a pass.
    490766|00000000||But! You're in luck - so happens I've got a few to sell.
    490762|00000000||These passes - what are they?
    490909|00000000||Can you go any lower?
    490931|00000000||No deal.
    490933|00000000||Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hold up!
    490939|00000000||Might have a little work for you… Reduce the price for a job well done. Eh?
    490952|00000000||No. I'd rather pay.
    490951|00000000||Not interested.
    490950|00000000||What kind of work?
    490954|00000000||What kind of work?
    490956|00000000||Nearby, just to the south-east, me sister's husband's got a business. He and some lads tidy up battlefields.
    490957|00000000||Problem is there's always swarms of shite botherin' 'em - you know, them monsters drawn to corpses.
    490959|00000000||Give 'im some protection, and I'll swing you one beautiful discount.
    477906|00000000||I'll pay for the pass.
    491035|00000000||Think I know who you're talking about…
    491036|00000000||Problem is, I don't help men like him.
    491064|00000000||If you don't, you don't. Every man's got his reasons. No discount, I'm afraid.
    477921|00000000||Refused to help him.
    491131|00000000||Think I saw your brother-in-law, but walked on by… Maybe I can go back?
    491133|00000000||Forget about it, they're done by now. Were to stop there only briefly, then move on.
    491154|00000000||Tough, no discount, gonna pay the full price?
    491012|00000000||Ran into them, but ignored them.
    491068|00000000||Fine, I'll pay.
    491069|00000000||I'll think about it. Bye.
    491011|00000000||I killed the monsters, but your brother-in-law didn't survive.
    491121|00000000||Actually ran into your brother-in-law, tended to the monsters, too, but… He, uh, was killed.
    491123|00000000||What?! You pullin' me leg?!
    491127|00000000||Forget my offer! It's off the table, you git!
    477932|00000000||Always better with a discount.
    491026|00000000||That's better.
    491030|00000000||Pleasure doin' business with yous.
    477939|00000000||In that case, I'll take it.
    477908|00000000||I'll think it over, bye.
   1062188|00000000||All right, see what I can do.
    477940|00000000||I'll think it over, bye.
    477938|00000000||Aye. Good idea. Discount's yours, my friend.
    490968|00000000||I think you'll swing me a discount just because.
    477907|00000000||Maybe there's another way to do this…
    491010|00000000||Already helped him.
    491087|00000000||What's your offer, then? 'Cause I already ran into your brother-in-law. He and his men can work in peace.
    491099|00000000||Ahh, well then, that changes everythin'!
    477933|00000000||I'll think it over, bye.
    477903|00000000||Gotta think it over. So long.
    477894|00000000||Not interested.
    477893|00000000||How much for a pass?
    490826|00000000||What? Could dress up like Radovid and buy a gilded carriage for that much.
    490848|00000000||What'm I to do if you can't afford it?
    490908|00000000||Fine, I'll pay.
    477909|00000000||Sure hope the pass is worth this much coin.
    477910|00000000||You've made the right decision. Won't regret it.
   1011855|00000000||Oh, you again. Lookin' for a pass? I got a special price for you.
   1011866|00000000||I'll take it.
   1011867|00000000||Reduce the price a bit?
   1011870|00000000||Lemme think about it. Bye.
   1011869|00000000||Maybe you could… drop the price a bit?
    473538|00000000||Thanks for not startin' a row with those swine.
    473544|00000000||I don't generally poke my nose in other people's business.
    473550|00000000||Lookin' to stay the night?
    474690|00000000||No.
    474692|00000000||Ahh…
    473552|00000000||I'm looking for Hendrik.
    474700|00000000||Man lives in Heatherton.
    474702|00000000||Don't know where that is.
    474704|00000000||Other side of the hill. Looked thataway this morn and saw a strange glow. Imperials on the raid, perhaps, but who knows…
    473622|00000000||Bye.
    473616|00000000||Thanks, innkeep.
    473676|00000000||Thanks, innkeep.
    473678|00000000||Go out the back. More o' the baron's men in the village.
    473680|00000000||No need to worry about me.
    473682|00000000||I'd rather you not make any more trouble - for yourself, for us both.
    474694|00000000||Anything else you can tell me about Hendrik?
    473449|00000000||Odd fellow. Arrived from who knows where and for no apparent reason. Shacked up with a widow whose husband was stabbed for a scrap of bread.
    474696|00000000||Baron's men don't like strangers.
    474698|00000000||Aye, an' he stays out o' their way. Always seems to know when they're comin', always manages to disappear.
    473620|00000000||What do you know about Hendrik?
    473534|00000000||Have you any idea what the baron'll do when he learns of this butchery?! The village - he'll tear it apart before anyone can say it was some wanderin' mutant done it! An iron fist, he's got--
    473536|00000000||Where's Hendrik?
   1062581|00000000||You deaf?! Y'understand what I'm sayin'? Baron won't let this stand!
   1062583|00000000||Calm down. Your baron's no idiot. Seriously doubt he'll think you locals cut his men down with farming implements. Now where's Hendrik?
   1053914|00000000||So how many Black Ones you killed durin' this war, soldier?
   1053916|00000000||Me? None, yet. I served mostly in the north, Kaedweni front.
   1053918|00000000||Aah. So you fought your own.
   1053920|00000000||Whaddaya mean, my own? They wore different colors. Served a different king.
   1053922|00000000||But spoke the same tongue. Not like the Black Ones. It's them Radovid should be killin'.
    405908|00000000||Never seek to cross us again.
    370732|00000000||We shall forgive you this transgression, for you've done well. Your children are plump as piglets, sweet as caramel.
    372999|00000000||But now, we must talk to our white-haired friend.
    382676|00000000||The woman who cares for the kids…
    405665|00000000||She's a debt to pay. She is here by choice.
    405667|00000000||She's insane.
    405669|00000000||She knew what our pact entailed when she made it.
    405673|00000000||We helped her. She promised to serve.
    382684|00000000||Now she bears our mark, belongs to us.
    382658|00000000||Don't believe you. They say you always keep your word. So tell me everything, exactly as it happened.
    416573|00000000||We shall tell you, brave boy.
    382635|00000000||Where is she now?
    382654|00000000||I don't believe you.
    382637|00000000||The young woman I seek never hurt anyone without cause.
    382639|00000000||You've not seen her long. She's changed for the worse.
    382641|00000000||Why'd she attack you?
    382644|00000000||She's no longer the girl you once knew. Wrath consumes her.
    382617|00000000||Our deal - I did my part. Now you do yours.
    419061|00000000||A word once given we never break.
    382619|00000000||The girl... Mousy blonde - that's what they call it.
    382621|00000000||Thin as a rail - terrified, exhausted. She could barely stand, the poor thing.
    382623|00000000||We cared for her as best we could.
    382625|00000000||Like she was our own daughter.
    382627|00000000||Wasted affection. She proved a very naughty girl.
    382629|00000000||Mischievous, stubborn, and selfish.
    382599|00000000||Tell me about the woman I seek.
    382605|00000000||You know why I'm here.
    382613|00000000||You know why I'm here. You know what I want.
    382615|00000000||You shall dream of us, and return for what you reject. They always come back.
    382607|00000000||I'm impressed. Polymorphism - a rare talent.
    382609|00000000||Oh, I'd suck every last drop out of you!
    382611|00000000||Ah, to be woven together with you!
    419057|00000000||I'd be your best - and last.
    419059|00000000||Hm, not what I came for.
    382603|00000000||Is that polymorphism?
    382575|00000000||You looked different in the tapestry.
    382577|00000000||We're all dressed up just for you.
    382579|00000000||If you only knew how much time we spent in front of the glass!
    382601|00000000||Do you desire us?
    382504|00000000||Why do you look different now?
    382502|00000000||You used me.
    382506|00000000||You used me to tame the Whispering Hillock - a lot of work.
    382508|00000000||Naught's free, brave soul.
    382510|00000000||Did you destroy the evil powers? Have you brought peace to our domain?
    382520|00000000||I freed the spirit trapped in the tree.
    382543|00000000||Hear that, sisters?
    382545|00000000||Traitor!
    419047|00000000||She took the children! 'Twas her!
    382547|00000000||We made a deal. I was supposed to help the villagers. I held up my end of the bargain. They're safe now.
    382549|00000000||So, a mockery, you chose to outwit.
    382516|00000000||Yes.
    382518|00000000||So fortunate to have found so brave a knight, so able!
    382587|00000000||You've freed an ancient power.
    419051|00000000||It will rise again. Elsewhere, beyond our reach. Blood will flow once more.
    382589|00000000||What foolish things men sometimes do.
    382585|00000000||But she couldn't deceive you, brave knight.
    419049|00000000||You've rid the world of a great evil.
    382581|00000000||Whose spirit was trapped in the tree?
    382583|00000000||That of one who once cheated death.
    382553|00000000||Who was the spirit bound to the tree?
    382551|00000000||What do you want the kids for?
    382555|00000000||What did you need the children for?
    382557|00000000||Need? We? They needed us. Our care.
    417605|00000000||You exposed them to great danger.
    419053|00000000||We cannot help them! Because of you!
    419055|00000000||Leave it, sisters. Everything in its time…
    382559|00000000||Where are they?
    382561|00000000||They are far away.
    382563|00000000||Their troubles are over.
    373001|00000000||Come, it is another woman who interests you. Speak, White-Haired One.
    416565|00000000||I know that mark. This is Anna, the wife of the baron of Crow's Perch.
    416567|00000000||She belongs to no man.
    416569|00000000||A fruit ripened in her womb. A fruit sprouted from seed sown by a man she detested.
    419043|00000000||We helped her. She agreed to serve.
    419045|00000000||She bears the mark. She is ours.
    370728|00000000||You disobeyed us once more.
    370730|00000000||We are forgiving creatures, but you - you allowed the children to escape.
    382500|00000000||They never wanted to flee. They liked it here. They played.
    372997|00000000||Your punishment must be harsh. Now silence. We must speak to the White-Haired One.
    415267|00000000||Sheathe your weapon, young man…
    415269|00000000||He's even lovelier in real life…
    415271|00000000||Hm, in real life you're... different… than you were in the tapestry.
    415260|00000000||Well? Bring it here!
    415263|00000000||You were to bring it, not ogle it.
    569015|00000000||Swamp's kept Ambros' body in good shape… Hm… Even where the pellar smashed his head in…
    569680|00000000||Gotta incinerate it. That oughta get the specter to leave.
    569016|00000000||Leave the world of the living, never return again.
    560496|00000000||Come on.
   1075761|00000000||As bandits in Velen say, "I'll make remains of you."
    578292|00000000||You play gwent?
    578293|00000000||Do you really have no one else to play with?
   1042560|00000000||Always nice to play someone new.
   1042562|00000000||Fine, beggars can't be choosers, after all. I'll play you… and even stake one of my unique cards.
    578297|00000000||Pull out your cards.
    578289|00000000||Let's do this.
    578299|00000000||Listen, we'll play later.
    578290|00000000||Let's play later.
    578295|00000000||Care for a rematch?
    578296|00000000||Hmm… why not.
    578291|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    578307|00000000||Damn it all, I'd so hoped for victory. Alas, so be it - you've won the card fair and square.
    578306|00000000||Not only did I finally come across an opponent… But I beat him thoroughly. A fine day.
    578308|00000000||Know anyone else I could play?
    578309|00000000||Sjusta may still play - he was one of us once, but he's in Skellige now, fled a conviction. I know not for what. Oh, and there's the innkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads, but that one's a true prick.
    433723|00000000||Greetings.
    433725|00000000||Yeah?
    433654|00000000||Heard you have a problem - a monster you call a shrieker?
    433656|00000000||Aye, prowls about, it does. Snatches cows and goats, mostly, but it won't scorn a man if it runs into one. Borzoy, huntsman under the old lord, well, he said enough's enough, claimed he'd put a stop to it, drive the beast away.
    513285|00000000||Mhm.
    512010|00000000||Took a hatchet, laid in ambush for the shrieker beyond the moat, where the fields start. It's where we found 'im, guts stretched o'er the crown of a tree like gossamer. Took half a day to collect the parts, put 'em in a grave.
    433642|00000000||High time a professional took a look at this shrieker. Anyone around here know more about the beast?
    433644|00000000||Borzoy's son Symko does. Saw the horror with his own eyes. But… ye might find the lad hard to chat with. Still mourns his father, methinks.
    433646|00000000||I see… Where'll I find him?
    433648|00000000||At me homestead. I took the tyke in when he lost his dad. The mother passed long ago.
    512011|00000000||I'll take the job.
    433632|00000000||Farewell.
    433670|00000000||Farewell.
    512025|00000000||Sorry. Don't have time to help you just now.
    512013|00000000||Sorry. Don't have time for this.
    512012|00000000||Reward's too small.
    512023|00000000||I know times are tough but… I'll need you to cough up a bit more coin.
   1067266|00000000||What's that? Master! I've not seen that much coin in my life!
   1067268|00000000||Ye seek a lot… A few crowns too dear.
   1067272|00000000||Oh, you're as irritatin' as a gadfly 'fore a storm. Willin' to pay that much there and not a crown more.
   1067270|00000000||I suppose I can add that. Ye are riskin' your neck for us.
    512015|00000000||Let's talk about this contract…
    433630|00000000||Here about the contract for the shrieker.
   1090392|00000000||Here about the contract for the shrieker.
    512048|00000000||Keep the coin. You took in an orphan, need it more than I do.
    512050|00000000||And they call witchers unfeelin', inhuman… Well, I thank ye - from the bottom of me heart.
    512044|00000000||Keep the coin - for Symko.
    512052|00000000||Thank you… Any problems in the future, you keep me in mind.
    512045|00000000||Thank you.
    433634|00000000||Shrieker won't trouble you anymore.
    433636|00000000||Thank ye, master witcher. Your reward… 'Tain't much but as they say, "take care of the pennies…"
    433620|00000000||Here about the cockatrice you folk called a shrieker. Won't be a problem anymore.
    433622|00000000||What did you call it? A cockatrice?
    433624|00000000||Yes. Some also call it a skoffin.
    433626|00000000||Well, whatever ye or they call it, you've earned your reward. Here, all yours.
    566615|00000000||Is this truly what you want? To be a purveyor of cheap whores and watered-down wine?
   1022153|00000000||Hey! I can't control what I inherit!
   1033606|00000000||But you can control what you do with it!
   1045424|00000000||I know, I know. Which is exactly why I'm considering--
   1033608|00000000||Ugh! You're always considering! If it's not one thing, it's another! Let me know when you finally decide.
    424883|00000000||Me. Got my word.
    424885|00000000||Me. You have my word.
    498182|00000000||A freak's bilgey gas, naught more. How stupid d'you think I am?!
    424887|00000000||Grab the whoreson!
    354612|00000000||Smash the bugger!
    358428|00000000||No one.
    345035|00000000||Grab him!
    424881|00000000||Can't ever be sure.
    427961|00000000||Nosy bugger... Mhm…
    427963|00000000||Yeah, terrible trait.
    427965|00000000||Pokin' around where I probably shouldn't be, I know. But I gotta find the Putrid Grove.
    427969|00000000||That's a secret place for secret folk doin' secret business. And who's to say you're any good at keepin' a secret?
    464534|00000000||I'm so sorry… But we have to go.
    464532|00000000||No. No… Berthold…
    464538|00000000||Without him… I've no reason to.
    464530|00000000||Anisse... Anisse...
    464536|00000000||No, no… I can't leave her.
    464540|00000000||Geralt… Help me.
    464544|00000000||If you stay, you die.
    464546|00000000||If you stay, you die. Trust me.
    464652|00000000||That's not what he would want.
    464654|00000000||Perhaps. But it's what I want. I've had enough hiding, fighting… Without him, there's no point.
    464644|00000000||That's not what she would want.
    464646|00000000||What do you know? Huh! She was a stranger to you!
    464648|00000000||Yes, but…
    464650|00000000||Leave me! Leave me alone!
    464542|00000000||You have to come with us.
    465673|00000000||You have to come with us.
    465677|00000000||Yes… I must.
    465675|00000000||Yes… I must.
    506236|00000000||We tried.
    506237|00000000||Let's go to the Kingfisher. This time we can't blow it.
    465679|00000000||Thanks.
    464512|00000000||We're going. Now.
    464514|00000000||Go-going.
    464449|00000000||We're going. Now.
    464451|00000000||If you stay in Novigrad, you'll die.
    464453|00000000||I can't guarantee you'll be safe if you come with us. But if you stay here, you will definitely die.
    464455|00000000||He's right.
    464457|00000000||We'll hide somewhere… wait it out.
    464459|00000000||Darling… I beg you.
    464461|00000000||Shut up! I told you last winter we should leave. But no, that didn't suit you! Well, here's your comeuppance!
    464439|00000000||You all right? Can you walk?
    464441|00000000||Y-yeah… Yes.
    464443|00000000||I'll not leave here. I'm no fool!
    464445|00000000||Berthold…
    464447|00000000||Have you seen what's happening out there?! They'll catch us before we can reach the port… Catch us, and kill us!
    594538|00000000||Do you mind not touching me?
    594540|00000000||An abomination.
    594542|00000000||Scandalous, letting such miscreants into the city…
   1016869|00000000||At your service.
   1016871|00000000||Excellent race! My sincere congratulations!
   1032783|00000000||It suffices not merely to believe in the Eternal Fire's miraculous power.
   1032785|00000000||One must spread the faith, seek to implant it in others' hearts.
   1032787|00000000||And above all watch closely those who reject the Eternal Fire, cast off the faith.
   1032789|00000000||Let us brand all unbelievers. To denounce them brings no shame, it is the duty of every righteous citizen!
    551301|00000000||There, take it. Twice the sum, as agreed. I keep my word!
    551303|00000000||Sure, second time around… Never mind. Thank you - and farewell.
    550699|00000000||Any tidin's?
    550690|00000000||Careful, sir, a monster prowls the bog. Enter the mist and ye'll never see home again!
    550743|00000000||Tell me more about the monster.
    550744|00000000||This monster - tell me more.
    550745|00000000||Only seen it once meself - and that from afar and past dusk. Thought it were a man at first. Then it turned, and I saw eyes burnin' like coals and a jaw full o' fangs, one next to the other.
    551171|00000000||Humanoid, nocturnal. Hmm. First attack - remember when it happened?
    551173|00000000||A week past, nearabout. It was then Borin vanished. Merek and Tomil went lookin' for him, didn't come back either, them two. I were afeared.
    551175|00000000||Now none dare venture into the bog. Camp stands deserted, and the peat there… master, it's the best sort! Black as pitch and oily - good for fuel and--
    551177|00000000||Fascinating. But staying with the topic at hand…
    550768|00000000||Assume you put up the notice in Downwarren.
    550769|00000000||Aye, 'twere me. Good to know someone reads 'em. Paid a scribe a dozen eggs to write it up.
   1067519|00000000||I mine peat, not gold, master. Could never pay that much in me life!
   1067521|00000000||That I simply do not have! Would a few crowns less satisfy ye?
    551205|00000000||All right, time I got to work. Where'll I find this monster?
    551207|00000000||Start south of here. But beware, bad, poxy air hangs o'er the marsh. Stings your eyes, claws at your throat… claws so hard ye could choke!
    551186|00000000||Time I got to work.
   1086551|00000000||So long.
    551187|00000000||How much're you willing to pay?
    551209|00000000||Afraid I'll need more than an ox needs. How much're you willing to pay, exactly?
   1067523|00000000||Oh, master, you value your services dear… But so be it, I'll agree to that.
   1067525|00000000||Seems you'd make a fool of me given the chance. I'm done hagglin'. Here's my final word.
    550770|00000000||I can help… For a fee.
    550771|00000000||Course! Why, even an ox don't pull a plow for free.
    550697|00000000||I can help… For a fee.
    550778|00000000||Monster's dead. Fog's dispersed.
    550779|00000000||Hah! Village folk'll be content! Given 'em cause to celebrate! Well, ye've earned your reward. Take it - and fare ye well!
    551214|00000000||This shit never changes - I risk my life for you folk while you try to swindle me outta coin. You'll give me all you've got, old-timer. Now.
    551218|00000000||H-here.
    551220|00000000||Good. Now get lost.
    551211|00000000||You'll pay the full sum. Now.
    551222|00000000||Fine, so be it. But you remember that I'll remember… You won't get out of paying this.
    551224|00000000||Thank ye, witcher, thank ye kindly, m'lord. Melitele bless ye, may ye be fruitful and--
    551225|00000000||Get to work. You've only got a week.
    551212|00000000||Fine… See you in a week.
    550782|00000000||Hang on a minute. This is less than we agreed.
    550783|00000000||Master witcher… That beast, it kept me from gatherin' peat. And I'd still me family to feed. But a few crowns left now and I've yet to buy new tools.
    551203|00000000||Show some mercy… I'll pay ye, I will. Pay ye twice the fee! But in a week's time, once I've made up some of me losses.
    550777|00000000||I'm here to collect the reward.
    550698|00000000||Farewell.
    551237|00000000||Farewell.
    550748|00000000||Take care of yourself.
    551295|00000000||Ye've come too early… We said a week!
    551297|00000000||Just making sure you remember.
    551299|00000000||See you soon.
    551305|00000000||I want my coin. Where is it?
    551236|00000000||Where's my coin?
    551235|00000000||Witcher… Greetin's.
   1049276|00000000||I seen that dream again. I was runnin' through the woods…
   1049278|00000000||Followin' a whisper that led me to the old tree on the hillock…
   1049280|00000000||I know the whispers, I know the hillock… A horrible evil sleeps inside it.
   1049282|00000000||Told ye already - go see the pellar. He'll chant ye some prayers.
   1049284|00000000||And beg the gods the voice don't lead ye in the woods in your dream again!
   1087748|04abbae2||Cannibal
    489515|00000000||Gave the signal. Spy should show up in Farcorners before midnight.
    489953|00000000||Must be the drop box.
    466268|00000000||Thank you, sir. Thank you…
    389516|00000000||Another shrine vandalized.
    389514|00000000||Destroyed this one, too.
    445511|00000000||I will not kill him!
   1043575|00000000||Of all places, why'd that mage have to blow hisself up in my alley?
   1043577|00000000||I'd barely hung my things, now I gotta wash 'em again! Damned blood just won't scrub off…
   1043579|00000000||My man comes home blood-dyed head to toe every day! Works at a slaughterhouse, see. So I know your pain.
   1043581|00000000||Gotta scrub the stains in cold water. Come out easier, then.
   1013167|00000000||Nothing to it.
   1013165|00000000||You shouldn't be here.
   1013169|00000000||Flee!
   1013163|00000000||Hmmm.
   1013161|00000000||Greetings.
   1013159|00000000||Nobody wants you here.
   1013157|00000000||Eh, a partisan's lot.
   1015647|00000000||Greetings.
   1049723|00000000||Need to burn the corpses. Otherwise drowners'll never stop congregating.
   1049730|00000000||There… Maybe now the drowners'll go feed elsewhere.
    514016|00000000||Aye?
    514025|00000000||Farewell.
    514038|00000000||Farewell.
    342066|00000000||You work with mages?
   1030327|00000000||Work with mages often?
   1030329|00000000||My, aren't you curious. You yourself lookin' for work, perhaps?
   1030331|00000000||No. I just know them. Usually not all that willing to get their hands dirty.
   1030333|00000000||Don't know 'em well, then. A hounded, hungry mage is desperate as any man. Not about to be fussy when takin' on work.
   1030335|00000000||Novigrad's a city of opportunities, chances to be seized. You should grab one, too.
    513268|00000000||The HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, once the crown jewel of the Redanian fleet. Decommissioned now, though.
    515839|00000000||Nice boat.
    513269|00000000||You'll need to leave your weapons if I'm to let you aboard.
    513271|00000000||Follow me.
    498268|00000000||Roots… So I'm right under Yen. Hey! Can you hear me?
    498269|00000000||Geralt! You scared me!
    498270|00000000||Sorry, didn't mean to.
    498927|00000000||I hope not! Let me know once you find Craven!
    499621|00000000||I'll wait here for you… Come right back, all right?
    498261|00000000||Is it Craven?!
    498263|00000000||No, this one's been here a while!
    498265|00000000||What?! I can't hear you! If you want to chat, come closer!
    498920|00000000||Her senses are really dulled…
    498259|00000000||No bite marks… Morkvarg doesn't eat his victims. Strange.
    498257|00000000||Another corpse… no bite marks here either…
    491354|00000000||Did you find something?
    491355|00000000||A trail…. leads right to a locked door!
    491357|00000000||I think you can get around it!
    590815|00000000||Weapons, men. We've got company.
   1001626|00000000||Who's that comin'?
   1001629|00000000||The giant with the scarred forehead. And some gray-haired bloke.
    590821|00000000||Louis won't be happy.
   1053730|00000000||My wine cellar's collapsed, all is buried.
   1053732|00000000||Côte de Blessure, Est Est… Bottles smashed, wine soaking the soil…
   1053734|00000000||I'm not at all surprised. When it all went kablooie, Dorfmeister's roof came down on his head.
    466033|00000000||So what's it to be? Gonna tell us where your coin is, or you prepared to have your ma's blood on your hands?
    466035|00000000||W-w-w-we've naught l-l-left. Ha' mercy, sir, don't hurt her, I beg ye.
    466009|00000000||Last chance: where's the coin?
    466011|00000000||I told you… We've naught left.
    466021|00000000||Won't mind if we check, will you? Thing is, we find anything…
   1055244|b45443e2||Wealthy Townswoman
   1052250|00000000||Whoreson Junior's men visit you, too? Collecting protection coin?
   1052252|00000000||They visited everyone. And everyone paid… Only Woulter stood up to them.
   1052254|00000000||Least someone found the courage!
   1052256|00000000||Lost it in the end, it seems… Just after they'd taken his third finger. And once he'd spilled where he kept his gold, they cut off the rest.
    488201|00000000||May I?
    488202|00000000||Depends what with.
    488203|00000000||Looking for someone who'll sail to Skellige. And take me with them.
    488175|00000000||My Atropos and me, we're due to sail for Ard Skellig.
    488177|00000000||Carryin' grain. But that's hush-hush.
    514375|00000000||Got any coin?
    475979|00000000||You Wolverstone, captain of the Atropos?
    475981|00000000||So you want to know… if I'm Atropos, cap'n of the Wolverstone…? No fuckin' clue, mate…
    475983|00000000||I need to get to Skellige.
    475997|00000000||You're back! Got the coin?
    476015|00000000||Let's go.
    476017|00000000||Ah-ah-ah. First we must drink to the wind, to good fortune, and to the strength of my Atropos.
    476921|00000000||Ah. Anchors aweigh!
    476011|00000000||Let's go.
    476013|00000000||Give me a bit.
    476019|00000000||Gimme some time to prepare.
    476021|00000000||Prepare all you want. She's not done loadin' as it is.
    475991|00000000||Gotta get more coin.
    475993|00000000||You sure do. For I won't even wet me arse in a bath without payment in advance.
    475989|00000000||Gotta get some.
    475987|00000000||I'll pay you.
    475999|00000000||Here. That enough?
    476001|00000000||Hefty sack, like a bull's. When do we sail?
    476918|00000000||Not sure you're ready. You can barely stand.
    476005|00000000||Know this, stranger. Captain Wolverstone never sails sober. The sea goes one way, Wolverstone the other. Makes the rockin' bearable.
    514049|00000000||So, ready to set sail?
    476009|00000000||Ship's ready. We sailin' or not?
   1075879|00000000||Eredin… King of the Wild Hunt. And Ciri…
    572342|00000000||Perhaps if we turned ourselves in, the hunters would be lenient?
    572343|00000000||A bit less torture, at best.
    579254|00000000||That's something… Have you heard about Falka's bed? It's a bench with rollers…
    579256|00000000||I don't want to hear it. No one wants to hear it.
    360960|00000000||Prick witcher! Master arsehole! Get outta here, you freak fuck!
   1070497|00000000||Poor Lideka… Just last eventide, saw her goin' to the well… She waved to me…
   1070499|00000000||Best stay home after dark. Bar your door, bar your windows.
    478615|00000000||Bravo! Damned fine doppler! Looked real! Heheh!
   1074410|00000000||Where do you think you're going? Warehouse job won't wait, you know.
   1073860|00000000||You were right to let your father take her.
   1073862|00000000||I'm not so sure.
   1073864|00000000||We could do nothing more. Nor could the witcher.
   1073866|00000000||If she can be helped, only a learned sage will know how.
   1073868|00000000||Perhaps you're right…
   1053925|00000000||May the Fire cleanse me thoughts… May it temper me heart…
   1053927|00000000||May all evil burn up in a puff o' smoke… May all that's good rise and find warmth at the Fire…
   1053929|00000000||May good folk flock to the Fire like moths… May the evil flee it like animals flee a burnin' wood…
    384152|00000000||By the powers of earth and sky! By the world that was to be your home…
    387607|00000000||I, who have tasted your blood, summon you to guide me!
    384154|00000000||Come, Blood Unborn!
    413844|00000000||Come, Blood Spurned!
    413846|00000000||Come, Blood Never Named!
    413848|00000000||Hear me upon the paths! Lead me along the trail of those bound to you by blood!
    390287|00000000||I see the blood of her blood! I see them bound!
    390487|00000000||The blood summons me…
    391059|00000000||A thick flow upon skin! Dark blood upon a light stone!
    390489|00000000||I am the Unnamed! I am blood immersed in blood!
    413905|00000000||I… I am dead!
    419998|00000000||The blood calls.
    390279|00000000||"I'm leaving, Phillip, Tamara's coming with me!" I see a face swollen, pulsing with blood.
    390281|00000000||Blood! Dark upon a pale visage! A drop trickles over bright gold.
    390283|00000000||I am a fist clasped… I am darkened blood beneath a white nail…
    390285|00000000||I am a tear of blood.
   1017045|00000000||Hattori! Wait!
   1055691|d6b15dea||Archgriffin
   1064773|00000000||You don't know where Philippa is exactly.
   1064779|00000000||You don't know where Philippa's hiding. Not exactly. Without me--
   1070653|00000000||Fret not. We will manage. Naturally, it would be easier with your help, but… you irritate me.
   1064788|00000000||Any last words?
   1064795|00000000||Fuck…
   1067290|00000000||Free the witcher! Then Radovid!
   1064781|00000000||You know too much. You impede me too often. And I find your arrogance an annoyance.
   1064783|00000000||I've had men killed for less.
   1064785|00000000||Follow me!
   1064775|00000000||This how you reward those who serve you?
   1064777|00000000||It is how I punish those who irritate me.
   1064772|00000000||This how you thank those who serve you?
   1064733|00000000||Well? Where is she? Where is Philippa?
   1064735|00000000||Like I said. House on the bridge. Closer to the other end.
   1064737|00000000||Close off this end, we need no guests, no innocent bystanders. Or witnesses.
   1064742|00000000||Damiaan, Jouke, Egbert, Freek, Caspar! You shall stay here, secure the rear…
   1064750|00000000||And kill the witcher.
    173467|00000000||Get back!
    464077|00000000||[Attack the monster.]
    570101|00000000||Pick it up. Take it in your arms.
    535506|00000000||Merciful gods!
    384503|00000000||And if it goes garrity?! It'll bite us in the arse before we know it!
    384505|00000000||Keep screaming and it will turn rabid. It's calm, for now.
    386266|00000000||Bloody hell. What happens when it gets ploughin' restless?
    386268|00000000||It'll bite through your jugular, and you'll bleed to death before I can help. Tell me if it starts wriggling - I'll calm it with magic.
    173473|00000000||Take it in your arms, quick!
    464079|00000000||[Turn the botchling into a lubberkin.]
    535504|00000000||Look!
    173449|00000000||Chose a lovely spot.
    173455|00000000||Dammit, will you relent? I ploughin' know I've done wrong.
    367742|00000000||Good.
    367744|00000000||The grave's dug up. And empty.
    367746|00000000||What's that mean?
    367748|00000000||Botchling's on the prowl.
    367082|00000000||Why you even here?
    427158|00000000||Same reason anyone comes here. Play a bit, have a good time.
    427160|00000000||Invite only, mate. Shit out of luck.
    367090|00000000||Farewell.
    367104|00000000||Tough luck. Fair enough.
    367092|00000000||Think we can make a deal?
    370085|00000000||Hear that? Another one.
    453867|00000000||No, we don't make deals.
    370087|00000000||How much?
    427167|00000000||Oy. Remember what I told you. We're to be polite-like.
    427169|00000000||Just my patience - runnin' a bit thin. We don't want your coin, we don't want anything else.
    453869|00000000||On your way, afore we get ploughin' angry, stop bein' all nice.
    367086|00000000||Make a deal?
    367096|00000000||Gonna get in there. Better for you to let me in.
    370089|00000000||And if we don't, then what?
    370091|00000000||I'll kill you.
    453871|00000000||D'you get that?
    367098|00000000||Got it, all right. He threatened us and reached for his weapon.
    370094|00000000||Die, you ploughin' bastard!
    367088|00000000||Going in, over your dead bodies, if necessary.
   1050311|00000000||Think you'll let me in anyway.
    413301|00000000||I think you're about to let me in.
    413303|00000000||By all means, please.
    453859|00000000||And you… wish me luck.
    413305|00000000||Luck be with you at the tables.
   1075667|00000000||Here's my invite. All yours if you want it.
   1075669|00000000||Yeah, gladly take it.
   1075671|00000000||Incidentally, bloody useless, these crowns. In Temeria, you could say "You met my friend Foltest?" Down in Nilfgaard, it'd be "Emperor'd like to vouch for me." With this shite? Nothin'.
   1075673|00000000||That's true! What we got here - some fuckin' ship? Ship couldn't vouch for you. What're you gonna say - "Meet my friend, this ship?" Bloody barmy.
   1075677|00000000||Downright stupid.
   1075675|00000000||All right, you can go in.
   1075665|00000000||Here's my invite.
    367084|00000000||Can't go in there.
    419005|00000000||This is no place for the likes of you.
    419009|00000000||Hangin' about like shite 'round a bunghole.
    547592|00000000||You deaf? Bugger off!
   1070491|00000000||Gods… What happened here?!
   1070493|00000000||Monster must've run 'em down. There's swarms in the city now.
   1070495|00000000||Argh, beg your pardon, but sod that sorta talk, you know? They've knife wounds. Means bandits dropped 'em, plain as that.
    380577|00000000||I offer raven feathers.
    405609|00000000||Once I was free... I shall be free once more…
   1049786|00000000||[Trick the being in the tree and destroy it.]
    402533|00000000||I offer your remains.
    405612|00000000||Once I was flesh... I shall be flesh once more…
    420698|00000000||No. I should draw your blood now, let the horse drink it… but I won't.
    420700|00000000||I don't trust you. I have to stop you, destroy you.
    400499|00000000||Betrayed...! Betrayed...! Betrayed...!
   1049785|00000000||[Start the ritual.]
    380587|00000000||I don't trust you, don't believe you. I know I have to stop you, destroy your heart.
    382448|00000000||I will live...!
    380559|00000000||Actually, I'm gonna kill you.
    416477|00000000||I found human remains.
    416479|00000000||Saw bodies of women and children in the woods. You've killed people who were no threat to you.
    416481|00000000||The wood killed them... For nature is blind... Death is never more than death…
    380565|00000000||Ready. We can start.
    380567|00000000||Let me fly on raven wings... Lay bones amidst the feathers…
    418949|00000000||Place all beneath my heart... My heart you must pierce…
    420696|00000000||And bring the steed...
   1004876|00000000||Camp on the Pontar - heard there's fights.
   1004877|00000000||Fights? What kind?
   1004878|00000000||Young'uns like us. Folk wager on 'em like cock fights.
   1004879|00000000||Should we go?
   1004880|00000000||Will they feed us?
    475781|00000000||Who's captain of this ship?
    475785|00000000||Lookin' at 'er.
    476482|00000000||Aye, her. That's right: I, a woman, am captain - shockin' as shit, I know.
    476490|00000000||Farewell.
    476488|00000000||Ever been there?
    476492|00000000||Ever sailed there?
    476494|00000000||Listen - the islanders attack all ships. When they hate someone - Nilfgaard, for instance - they attack 'em more, but truth be told not much more.
    476496|00000000||Boarded me once. Expect they wanted to see if I had captain's bollocks. That spot o' fun gave me enough Skellige for a lifetime.
    488085|00000000||Need to get to Skellige.
    488087|00000000||Not on this boat, you won't.
    488089|00000000||Pay you well.
    488091|00000000||The islanders live off plunderin' the seas. Not willin' to risk that.
    488082|00000000||Take me to Skellige?
    488093|00000000||Farewell.
    488083|00000000||Farewell.
    488081|00000000||Don't give up easy, do you?
    475791|00000000||No way in hell I'm sailin' to Skellige. Find another boat.
    560198|00000000||Stoppity-stop! A word with you, the pellar would 'ave!
    476464|00000000||Baron home?
    476466|00000000||Not your concern.
    476468|00000000||Need to talk to him. Open the gate.
    474201|00000000||Not a chance.
    474203|00000000||We heard what happened at the Crossroads.
    474206|00000000||We'll not let a man like that in here.
    594532|00000000||Why accost me?
    594534|00000000||May imps shit in your stew, you tramp.
    594536|00000000||Vile strumpet, tried to beguile my man.
   1072008|00000000||Fascinating, positively fascinating!
   1075284|00000000||These ruins conceal even more mysteries than I thought!
    454192|00000000||White Wolf. Been expectin' ye. Come closer.
    175930|00000000||Hope you realize what you've gotten yourself into.
    182877|00000000||Hope so too…
    182879|00000000||Miss Rosa's got a downright beastly temper. Shows no mercy once she grips a sword.
    501779|00000000||Grab a wooden one. And take care not to hurt the little miss, or you'll earn the ambassador's ire.
    501921|00000000||Follow me.
   1055923|00000000||Would you take a wooden one, already? Can't let you in with steel. Let's go, training room awaits.
   1091496|00000000||Wyvern
   1030479|00000000||I'll not sign on again. Not for a voyage through those waters.
   1030481|00000000||Nor'll I. The pittance they pay us, I'm not about to deliver meself to those Skellige butchers.
   1030483|00000000||Ye heard? The Albatross hasn't returned.
   1030485|00000000||Everybody knows. Crew's gutted and flayed by now, no doubt.
    335090|00000000||Where's that noble?
    335092|00000000||Lyin' here, quiet as a mouse, head split open like a rotted pumpkin.
    453455|00000000||More like a peasant now, sloshin' around in his own blood and shite. Be nothin' noble 'bout him.
    335094|00000000||Too quick a death, they gave 'im. Shoulda been made to suffer!
    335096|00000000||He's not the end of it. Sons can suffer for 'im… and the daughter! To the top!
    436480|00000000||We'd 'ave done better to burn the blasted barn to the ground!
   1028788|00000000||How about a few rounds of cards? Gwent, specifically.
   1086465|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
    421005|00000000||Farewell.
    420993|00000000||Farewell.
    420991|00000000||Show me what you got.
    421003|00000000||Like to take a look.
    421001|00000000||A spot o' cider for ye? Or a bit o' dry curd? Me larder's not exactly burstin', but what I've got's sure to please.
   1005571|00000000||Because she'd blasphemed the Eternal Fire.
   1005576|00000000||Because she blasphemed the Eternal Fire. Only thing that ties her to the other victims.
   1005572|00000000||I don't know.
   1005578|00000000||I don't know. Too early to draw any conclusions.
   1005580|00000000||Ingrid… I know this is a hard time for you, but… usually, the killer leaves a note on the body, a note indicating his next victim. May I?
   1005582|00000000||Very well. But you shall be on your own. I do not wish to see her in this state. I do not wish to remember her like that.
   1005584|00000000||And… let her be the last victim. Please.
   1007762|00000000||Bruises, broken fingernails… She defended herself. Must be why it took him longer. And why he almost got caught.
   1007764|00000000||Here it is. "Sweet Nettie - Crippled Kate's." Growing bolder. Not just the name, but the place, too.
   1007766|00000000||Won't get away this time.
   1005574|00000000||Murderer might've grown bored of prostitutes and beggars… might've wanted to see how the upper classes die.
   1005570|00000000||Might've gotten bored of whores and beggars.
    440348|00000000||We got 'im, Lady Ingrid! Wasn't easy, but--
   1007759|00000000||Lower that crossbow before you hurt yourself. This man is innocent.
    456275|00000000||Forgive me. I saw 'im runnin', thought it was the killer fleein'--
    456301|00000000||I was chasing him. And I'd 'ave caught him if you hadn't gotten in my way.
    572873|00000000||Out of my sight. At once.
    572875|00000000||Mother… Why did he do this to her? Why…?
   1007772|00000000||Halt! 'Fore I put a bolt 'tween your eyes!
   1007774|00000000||Listen, you got the wrong guy.
   1007776|00000000||Save your trickery! Takin' you to the heiress!
   1007778|00000000||Ugh. Well, killer's already escaped. Lead the way, hero.
    456189|00000000||There he is! Get 'im!
    459293|00000000||Spread out! Murderer's still here!
   1007768|00000000||Don't try anythin', wise arse. Got this aimed straight at your back.
   1014559|00000000||Murder!
   1014560|00000000||Stop the killer!
   1013225|00000000||Guards!
   1055403|e63ae179||Townswoman
   1053627|00000000||Oh, king of dear Redaaaaaniaaaa, we now must say goodbyyyyye…
   1053629|00000000||You've lost yourself in maaaaniaaaa…
   1053631|00000000||Don't try to take Novigrad -
   1053633|00000000||Or you'll die!
    417882|00000000||Should search this hole.
    417941|00000000||Floor's worn by a moving door - something behind this wall.
    386318|00000000||Gran! Gran! Bumblebee bit Yagna in the arse!
    417343|00000000||Gran, come!
    390394|00000000||Gran'll come runnin' soon. She hates it when we say "arse."
    505706|00000000||Now quick, hide. You can sneak into the hut soon as Gran comes out.
    417345|00000000||You'll get to talk, and she won't bother you.
   1004083|00000000||I advise you well - stear far afield o' Spitfire Bluff.
   1004084|00000000||Or?
   1004085|00000000||First off, can't do a good trade in a wasteland.
   1004086|00000000||And?
   1004087|00000000||Well, second… eerrr... Just take my advice and don't ploughin' go there!
   1054082|00000000||Me granddad told me a dragon nested in them hills once upon a time.
   1054084|00000000||Then along came a knight in shinin' armor. George were his name. Set right to work and…
   1054086|00000000||Slish, slash, slew the besotted beast! Sadly, he died of his wounds soon after.
   1054088|00000000||Out o' gratitude our forebears built 'im a tomb. It stands in the caves to this day.
   1054090|00000000||A knight like George - we could use one now…
   1043521|00000000||I love you.
   1043523|00000000||Already told you to get lost! You'll get me in trouble…
   1043525|00000000||Where am I to go?! When I can't see you I sigh and sob!
   1043527|00000000||Your mom'll be the one sobbin' when my pimp breaks your neck, drops you in the sewers.
   1012880|00000000||Forgive them - hatred blinds them.
   1012878|00000000||Greetings.
   1012876|00000000||Hey!
   1012874|00000000||Greetings.
   1012872|00000000||Run!
   1012870|00000000||I'll smash your face!
   1012868|00000000||Life...
   1066191|00000000||Not now, Geralt!
   1032911|00000000||Borgna dressed Lady Patricia for the funeral. Said… oh, she said some horrible things.
   1032913|00000000||Yeah? What?
   1032915|00000000||Said the murderer'd gouged out her eyes. Cut out her heart. Burned her with a hot iron till…
   1032917|00000000||Stop. Can't sleep at night after listenin' to such monstrosities.
    567949|00000000||Leftovers, cuts of meat… catoblepas? Wonder what spell requires that.
    567950|00000000||A dry red from Zubarran. Southern slope, notes of... blackcurrant and citrus.
    589302|00000000||Ugh, pains the heart…
    567959|00000000||Pepper, cinnamon, cloves. Spices both rare and expensive… Not terribly magical, though.
    567962|00000000||Human. From an artery.
    589306|00000000||Can't be far. Wouldn't have made it.
    590012|00000000||Drowners and a water hag. My favorites.
    590014|00000000||Package still intact. Don't sense anything magic, though… Wonder how Keira'll explain this one.
    590016|00000000||Hid and waited for help.
    590018|00000000||It never came. That's Velen for you.
    449870|00000000||Wonderful hidin' ye gave 'em!
    449872|00000000||You failed to mention she was a werewolf.
    449874|00000000||Well-- I mean, we wasn't altogether sure ourselves. But that's a good thing - it's what witchers are for, innit? Killin' monsters?
   1029710|00000000||Thanks for your help. This here's well earned.
    312802|05e75e62||Harpy
   1023357|00000000||Nosy bastard! Tend to 'im!
    496150|00000000||The trees! Hide in the trees!
    513032|00000000||Closed. Go bugger each other somewhere else.
    568157|00000000||Last body - where was it found?
    568158|00000000||In a side alley, along the road from the docks to the brothel district. Someone had dropped it there in the middle of the night.
    568159|00000000||Need to examine that spot.
    568141|00000000||Where were the bodies found?
    568160|00000000||Heard the bodies were desiccated.
   1020604|00000000||Do you believe a beast killed them? I don't. The bodies were dried out, but perhaps they'd tried to apprehend a mage, who cast a nasty spell on them?
    568161|00000000||Was it dehydration?
    573948|00000000||Strictly speaking, no. Though I don't quite know what to compare it to.
    568152|00000000||Heard the corpses were desiccated.
    568140|00000000||Find any wounds on the bodies?
    568153|00000000||Find any claw or fang marks on the bodies?
   1019722|00000000||Fangs, no. Claws, not quite. Only scratches, fingernails most likely, from their adventures with whores…
    568172|00000000||Thanks. Should go see the place where they were found.
    568173|00000000||Good luck.
    568137|00000000||I'm looking into the dead guards. Heard you did autopsies.
    568139|00000000||Did their friends hire you? Good, I'm happy to help.
    568135|00000000||Dead guards - tell me about them.
    568138|00000000||Nothing just now.
    568136|00000000||Farewell.
   1038487|00000000||You're the medic…
    568134|00000000||What can I help you with?
    381812|05a898ad||Mob
    166469|d6a00ba0||Peasant
   1008811|00000000||Fire!
   1008813|00000000||Eternal Fire!
   1008815|00000000||Geralt the Rivian…
   1008800|00000000||Ah, you rogue!
   1008847|00000000||I won't allow it!
   1053138|00000000||Have you heard? Meiersdorf's bees are dropping like, well, flies. If there's disease in the air, it could very well spread to our hives.
   1053144|00000000||It could be disease… But it could also be the Apiarian Phantom.
   1053146|00000000||Pshaw, don't tell me you believe that nonsense.
   1053148|00000000||I don't, but… well, Meiersdorf's posted a bounty - for driving off some wraith. So perhaps there's something to it.
   1052361|00000000||Got anythin' for an achin' belly? Stabbin' pain, here, under me belt, since yesterday.
   1052363|00000000||I propose Hypericum perforatum leaves, known also as goatweed. They help with cramps, clean the bilious tract.
   1052365|00000000||Well ain't you learned for a stallkeeper.
   1052367|00000000||Before the war I lectured in botany at the academy here… Will that be all?
   1014385|00000000||What...?
   1014383|00000000||At your service.
   1014381|00000000||Greetings.
   1014379|00000000||Simpleton.
   1014377|00000000||Aaaah!
   1041927|38240875||Fisstech Addict
    566263|00000000||Cart tracks lead into the woods.
    566268|00000000||Stone's grazed. Monster must've grown furious. Could be a leshen… if so, oughta find its totems nearby.
    566269|00000000||There was a fight here. Two dwarves and… something big.
    566270|00000000||A dwarf went this way.
    566271|00000000||Wounded dwarf tried to flee. Bleeding heavily.
    566272|00000000||Deep wound on his back. Bled to death.
    566273|00000000||Roots pinned this one to the ground. So hard he suffocated.
    566287|00000000||Everything says leshen, a young one. Must've arrived here recently. Need to find its totem.
    566289|00000000||Lo and behold, a leshen's totem. Now to destroy it - oughta piss it off, make it leave its lair…
    566740|00000000||Hm… Ordinary ravens, looks like. No sign of a totem.
    566739|00000000||Not a leshen's birds… False trail.
    571456|00000000||Crows serve leshens. Should find some near the totem.
    566262|00000000||Loggers' hut. Need to find the spot where they died.
   1012838|00000000||How-ow-ow-oo...!
   1012836|00000000||How-oo...!
   1012834|00000000||Stand back, everyone!
   1012830|00000000||You'll regret that!
   1012822|00000000||You're tempting death.
   1012832|00000000||Rivian.
   1012826|00000000||I've killed Rivians, before.
   1012846|00000000||Why so quiet, everyone?
   1012824|00000000||Hey?
    499062|f4ea295c||Quartermaster
   1056101|00000000||Show us what you're bringin' in.
   1056103|00000000||Ruben, you daft…? It's me, Steffen. From the Bits? You don't know me?
   1056229|00000000||Present what you've got, what you aim to bring into the city.
   1056231|00000000||Oh, small things, sundries. This, that, the other. Truly, officer, naught to fret about 'ere, because--
   1056233|00000000||Search 'im. Find anythin' suspect, to the dungeon with 'im. Next!
   1052602|00000000||Spare no donation, I tell you! Spare no crown! Spare nothing, and you yourselves shall be spared.
   1052604|00000000||Make offerings to the temples and chapels of the Eternal Fire, and the horror of war will bypass our fair city!
   1052606|00000000||To be stingy is to be short-sighted - you will reap what you sow!
   1058464|00000000||I found her.
   1058455|00000000||Found her.
   1058469|00000000||We'll talk about her, don't worry. But I need to ask you something first.
   1058456|00000000||We'll talk about her later.
   1058448|00000000||Still don't know anything specific, but I'm on her trail.
   1058452|00000000||Well, will you stand there like a knob? Find her!
   1058446|00000000||Ahh… What of Anna?
    390668|00000000||Gave Tamara your gift.
    390672|00000000||How'd she react?
    402527|00000000||Probably not like you'd have wanted. She threw the doll away.
    402529|00000000||Threw it away? Oh gods, I'd hoped, despite all… Argh…
    390588|00000000||Gave your daughter the doll.
   1003420|00000000||Can't help wondering why you made a deal. With the Nilfgaardians?
   1003422|00000000||What could I do? Cast myself at them and die a hero? Fuck a hero's death. Fuck death.
   1003424|00000000||Rather live as a traitor?
   1003426|00000000||Ere long none will remember it. Temeria is no more, there's naught left to betray.
   1003428|00000000||The local Nilfgaardian garrison - doesn't look that strong.
   1003430|00000000||What of it? Even were I to attack, cut 'em down to a man, others will come soon. Black Ones will flood this land, take control before long. Sure as we've all got arseholes, they will.
   1003416|00000000||You're working with Nilfgaard - why?
   1003432|00000000||How'd you wind up here? Just curious.
   1003434|00000000||It's no secret. I was a Temerian soldier - my unit smashed at the war's start. Soon after, we'd lost hope of regrouping, drivin' the foe back.
   1003435|00000000||Those who remained wandered north. Others, deserters or merely broken men, joined us. We were a snowball rollin' down a slope. By the time we reached Crow's Perch, I commanded a sizeable force.
   1003437|00000000||Just march into the fortress, make yourselves at home?
   1003439|00000000||With Nilfgaard advancin', the local lord had fled, abandoned the Perch. Once this war's over and Nilfgaard's victorious, the Black Ones will grant me a title. All talk of a self-proclaimed baron will cease.
   1003417|00000000||How'd you wind up here?
   1003500|00000000||Heard anything about there being witches in Velen?
   1003502|00000000||I pay no heed to peasant babblin'.
   1003504|00000000||Common folk see witches, wizardry, devils and who knows what the fuck else every which way they turn.
   1003418|00000000||Heard anything about witches in the area?
    351008|00000000||So long.
    351015|00000000||See you.
    390590|00000000||I know where your wife is.
    390845|00000000||Got news of your wife.
    390847|00000000||Ploughin' hell, why'd you not say so forthwith? Where is she?! Why have you not returned with her?
    390849|00000000||She's in Crookback Bog. Got food, a place to live, and keeps herself busy. Didn't look like she had the slightest desire to leave.
    390851|00000000||You were to bring her back, not report on the conditions she lives under!
    391986|00000000||Your wife can decide her own fate. I would've had to bring her back by force. Wouldn't want that, would you?
    391984|00000000||I was supposed to find her. And I did. That was our deal, nothing more.
    403257|00000000||You still think me rotten to the core, a base bastard, don't you? You believe I alone am at fault for what happened here.
    403269|00000000||Doesn't matter what I believe.
    403289|00000000||Yet looking at you I see contempt. Can't speak for the world you witchers inhabit, but in ours, nothing is ever black and white.
    403265|00000000||My opinion doesn't matter.
    403263|00000000||Well, yes.
    403267|00000000||Actually, that's exactly what I think.
    403271|00000000||The world might seem black and white to you witchers, but for us common folk it's shades of gray. As is my family's story.
    474761|00000000||Sorry, but - your life story? Just not interested. This isn't a social call. I'm here on business.
    474763|00000000||Will you at least tell me how Anna wound up in that blasted bog?
    474751|00000000||Not interested in your family's story.
    474753|00000000||So tell me how it was with you - really.
    474757|00000000||Probably gonna say you're not the only one to blame. All right, then. I'm willing to hear your side of the story.
    403291|00000000||With Annie… it was love at first sight. A spear tore through my shoulder at the Battle of Anchor, she tended to my wound. Once I'd recovered, I asked her to marry me. She wept with joy.
    403379|00000000||Soon after, Tamara was born, and after that they sent me to Cidaris. A warlord had risen against King Ethain, and Foltest sent help.
    403385|00000000||It was one battle to the next, one conflict after another… 'Twas a life of war, I was seldom home, and I found comfort in drink. Grew so fond of hooch I couldn't part with it when I did get home.
    403393|00000000||So, your fault after all.
    403437|00000000||Still seems like your fault to me.
    403450|00000000||Will you let me finish?
    403395|00000000||What happened then?
    403452|00000000||All right. What then?
    403454|00000000||I went from front to front, battle to battle, collecting soldiers' coin, while Anna sat alone with the babe for months. Later I learned she'd not been so alone after all. For nearly three years she'd found comfort in the arms of one Evan, a childhood friend. A dog's bunghole.
    403769|00000000||Understand, dammit? One tussle in the hay I'd 'ave waved aside, put it out of my mind, but the woman cuckolded me for years! Without a whisker of concern for me, for my love!
    403771|00000000||How'd you find out?
    403456|00000000||Came home one day and Anna was gone, her things, too. Found a letter. She wrote that she didn't love me, that she'd left me for that knoblicker and taken Tamara with her.
    403720|00000000||Felt like I'd been rammed in the arse by a horse. I went to find the bugger, to get the girls back, bring them home. Yet soon as I saw him, something turned inside me, something dark. I slaughtered the shit-eating twat and fed his carcass to the dogs.
    403750|00000000||Seems they call you Bloody for a reason…
    403754|00000000||Guess they call you the Bloody Baron for a reason after all…
    403758|00000000||What?
    403760|00000000||Your nickname. Makes sense now.
    403762|00000000||No, no, that's an entirely different story.
    403752|00000000||What did Anna say?
    403756|00000000||Imagine Anna wasn't exactly pleased…
    403765|00000000||Hah! Bloody understatement, if I've ever heard one! She flew into a fit, hysteria, threw herself at me, kickin' and clawin'. Finally grabbed a knife. It would've been the end of me if I'd not leapt aside.
    403767|00000000||It was the first time I hit her. I had to calm her. Felt I had no other means.
    403773|00000000||Things changed, they would never be the same. Anna tried to take her own life - and mine - several times. She would prod me, goad me, taunt me - in the hope I would hit her again, perhaps? She'd scream that I'd robbed her life of love, that I'd destroyed the idea for her and so might as well kill her.
    403781|00000000||How many times I apologized, how many armfuls of blooms and gifts I brought… She cared not a bit. Two years of her anger had turned to indifference, broken at times by her bouts of hysteria and my bouts of drunkenness.
    403787|00000000||Cannot fathom how we survived those years, but we did. Though as you know now, not everything was as it might have seemed.
    403518|00000000||Got only yourself to blame, I think. Leaving her to fend for herself…
    403520|00000000||How was I not to? I was a soldier! I had no choice.
    403522|00000000||There's always a choice.
    403524|00000000||Argh, sod it all. I see all my prattling's for naught. You won't bring Anna home, I know that. Will you betray to me how she landed in that bloody swamp?
    403483|00000000||You're at fault.
    403526|00000000||Don't know why you're telling me all this. Your relationship with your wife? Your concern, not mine.
    403528|00000000||Argh, a witcher. Should've expected as much.
    403489|00000000||Can't say I care all that much about this.
    403480|00000000||Seems you deserve each other.
    403496|00000000||You're right - fault's on both sides, yours and hers.
    403498|00000000||I'm content that you finally see that.
    402547|00000000||Very well, then - if you won't bring Anna home, you might at least tell me how she landed in that blasted swamp.
    403058|00000000||Your wife is with the Crones.
    403060|00000000||Your wife is with the Crones, as their servant.
    403062|00000000||What the fuck do you mean? What Crones?
    403128|00000000||Ones who live in Crookback Bog.
    403130|00000000||Oh, I've heard folk speak of them, but thought it naught but tales to scare the children with.
    403201|00000000||And she's a servant to these Crones? What the devil does that mean?
    403175|00000000||How on earth did she land there?!
    402549|00000000||A fiend captured her.
    402553|00000000||They fled by night. They were riding past the forest when a beast serving the Crones attacked them and abducted Anna.
    402555|00000000||A beast? Bloody hell… And Tamara - was she hurt?
    402557|00000000||No.
    402559|00000000||Ah, thank the gods for that. So, Annie - what happened to her?
    402561|00000000||The creature carried her deep into Crookback Bog. Didn't harm her, though. In fact, Anna seems content there.
    403196|00000000||Content? What is this tripe, witcher? What in bloody blazes is she doing in that swamp?
    402551|00000000||She made a pact with the Crones.
    402578|00000000||She made a pact with the Crones and… well, I think she might've lost her mind.
    402584|00000000||A pact? What the bloody hell?
    402587|00000000||She was with child, a child she didn't want to bear. Went to the Crones for help. They promised to rid her of the problem in exchange for a year of her service. And they kept their word, in their own twisted way.
    474769|00000000||What do you mean?
    402589|00000000||Anna must've thought the child inside her would somehow disappear. Instead the Crones sapped her of strength, and ultimately forced her body to miscarry. I think that's when she started to lose her mind.
    402596|00000000||Then they placed magic tethers on her, tethers that cause great pain when tested. A guarantee she'll pay off her debt.
    403203|00000000||A pact with witches… Bloody nightmare, sounds like some jest! We must get her out! We can't leave her there!
    402707|00000000||Venturing into the swamp, even with armed men, is just a bad idea. It's a dangerous place, inherently. And I think those Crones are a greater threat than anyone realizes.
    402719|00000000||I'll not sit on my arse waiting for them to return her! Would you wait, count on their mercy if they had your daughter?
    402721|00000000||Probably not. But I'm a witcher.
    403245|00000000||And I'm a husband and a father who's fucked up his life and the lives of his loved ones. I'll gather my men, go there and retrieve Anna!
    402669|00000000||I wouldn't recommend venturing into the swamp.
    402667|00000000||Do what you want.
    402677|00000000||Do what you will, but leave me out of this. You ask me? Wading through the swamp to mess with the Crones - just plain stupid.
    402703|00000000||What would you have me do?! Sit on my arse and wait for her return? I'll send men, go with them myself, and we will pull her out!
    402705|00000000||I've warned you. What you do - that's your business.
    480989|00000000||She screamed like a madwoman. In an instant, all had forgotten the wager.
    487036|00000000||Every man ran - to save his skin, even were he to break his neck.
    480990|00000000||And? They make it?
    480991|00000000||Some, aye. Others were not so fortunate. But what happened then… I must say, witcher - seen a lot, but nothing like this, never.
    487042|00000000||Uh oh. I know that look.
    487043|00000000||You're a fast learner. You'll know the rest once you find my wife.
   1074013|00000000||Working on it.
   1074015|00000000||And making piss poor progress.
   1074017|00000000||They split up - hadn't considered that possibility before. But don't worry, I'll find Anna, too.
    391493|00000000||I'm listenin'. What do you come to me with?
    474874|00000000||Any news for me?
    391566|00000000||Never offered to do that.
    391799|00000000||How do you know she's safe? You see her at least?
    391841|00000000||Never said I saw her. I talked to the man who took her in.
    391843|00000000||Tamara's not in any danger, she's safe and sound. That I know.
   1058272|00000000||Incidentally, what of my Annie? Learned anything?
   1058270|00000000||Very well, you were to find them both. What of Anna? Learned anything?
   1058428|00000000||We'll talk about her, don't worry. But right now, you'll tell me about Ciri. Just like we agreed.
   1058422|00000000||Nothing yet. But I'm on her trail.
   1058424|00000000||Well, what're you waitin' for?
   1058426|00000000||For you to tell me about Ciri. Like we agreed.
    486421|00000000||Huh, fine. A word once given…
    480553|00000000||When Ciri was on the mend, we took her out on a hunt. Thought a bit o' gallopin' would warm up her limbs gone stiff from so much bed rest.
    402505|00000000||Sooner you accept this, the better. Face it - you haven't been the best father.
    402507|00000000||I have not, true. But I'd change, I'd be different. If only she'd return, if only they'd both come back.
    402509|00000000||Maybe all is not yet lost! She's in Oxenfurt, you say? Maybe she hasn't left, maybe she'll hear me out.
    402511|00000000||You can always try. Wouldn't get my hopes up, though.
    402513|00000000||I shall try. I must. Life is pointless without her and Anna. I've nothin' to lose.
    402502|00000000||You've gotta come to terms with it.
    402500|00000000||I don't blame her.
    402515|00000000||She's not coming back. Period. And I don't blame her. I wouldn't want to return to a home like this, either.
    402517|00000000||Ah, horse bugger you blind. I know what you think already, you've no need to repeat it.
    402519|00000000||I've not been a good father, I know, but… perhaps it's not too late.
    402521|00000000||Can always try. Wouldn't count on succeeding, though.
    402523|00000000||I've nothing to lose.
    390807|00000000||Not gonna happen.
    390809|00000000||I've done my part. You've got dozens of men - there's gotta be someone you can send.
    390811|00000000||You refuse to go?
    391912|00000000||Mhm.
    390813|00000000||Fuck you.
    391928|00000000||Yet, if you're ever in the area, by chance, even… take this. And just make sure she's all right.
    391930|00000000||What is it?
    391932|00000000||A letter of safe conduct. Ever since the Redanians took hold of the Pontar Delta, they've made it damned hard to get to Novigrad without one.
    390801|00000000||That much I can do.
    390803|00000000||I'm grateful. Take this - call it enticement. And this might prove useful.
    391910|00000000||What is it?
    391908|00000000||A letter of safe conduct. Ever since the Redanians took hold of the Pontar Delta, they've made it damned hard to get to Novigrad without one.
    390805|00000000||I'll go.
    390815|00000000||I shan't trust some peasant dolt. I shan't trust whoever it is helped her! I need to know for certain she's safe!
    391885|00000000||Go to her. You must be sure, see her yourself. I shan't believe anyone else.
    391803|00000000||No, but I talked to the man who helped her escape, and then took her in.
    391809|00000000||Tamara is safe and sound. From what I gathered, she has no desire to see you again, no intention to return.
    390703|00000000||I saw her, we talked. She said I could tell you she's safe…
    391828|00000000||When will she come home?
    391830|00000000||And that she's not coming back.
    390721|00000000||She's not to return? But… I've prepared all for her, her rooms await. I sent away for new pantobles from Toussaint. How can she not come back?
    391845|00000000||She doesn't wanna come back - made that clear. But she's safe and sound.
    390632|00000000||Your daughter's in Oxenfurt.
    390634|00000000||What the blazes…?! She all right? In good health? Safe? Why haven't you brought her back?!
    440036|00000000||Triss, we were so concerned.
    440038|00000000||Right to be. Hunters were on my trail.
    586746|00000000||Triss! What happened upstairs? Is everything all right?
    586748|00000000||No. Everything's not all right.
    508543|00000000||Geralt, wait a minute. I need to see who made it.
    579435|00000000||Why the tears, my dear lady? You shouldn't worry yourself - it tarnishes your beauty.
    579437|00000000||Guess you must've worried quite a bit.
    579439|00000000||No. I was born ugly.
    579442|00000000||You fleeing to Kovir, too?
    579444|00000000||No, but I am helpin' the others set off. You know me… bleedin' heart and all.
    579452|00000000||It only start bleeding now? They've been burning mages for months around here.
    579454|00000000||But only since recently on this scale. Besides…
    579446|00000000||Heart only start bleeding now? Puzzling.
    579445|00000000||Yeah, I know you. You have no heart.
    579448|00000000||Yeah, I know you. You don't have a heart - bleeding or otherwise.
    579450|00000000||Frankly, I'm surprised at your insight into my anatomy. But on a more serious note…
    455782|00000000||Gonna enter the sewers now. I'll signal when the path's clear, you follow my trail. And don't stray from it, no matter what.
    586733|00000000||I will go with Geralt. You, Dijkstra, go to the port and see that everything's in order with the ship.
    586735|00000000||On my way.
    461122|00000000||We'll meet there. I hope.
    586737|00000000||Triss… really want to go with me? No offense, but--
    586739|00000000||Offense taken. Stop talking and lead the way.
    455778|00000000||Going in the sewers.
    455780|00000000||If anything happens, I'll defend you.
    455786|00000000||If the need arises, I'll defend you.
    461087|00000000||You can also count on my help.
    461089|00000000||Yes… the help of a Redanian spy. Radovid's right-hand man.
    461093|00000000||That was long ago, sir.
    461095|00000000||You raised that madman. You taught him to kill. You--
    461097|00000000||This is no time to settle past scores. End of discussion.
    579432|00000000||I look forward to having friends in Kovir. Especially among King Tancred's entourage.
    461041|00000000||Shhh. Triss is about to speak.
    586731|00000000||We'll talk later.
    455750|00000000||We've waited long to escape. Till we could make sure Kovir will take us, till we could acquire enough coin to hire a ship, till we could find a captain we could trust.
    455752|00000000||We've waited too long. There's no more time for hesitation. We must leave Novigrad today.
    455754|00000000||This is madness. Hunters stand on every corner.
    455762|00000000||So we'll get to the port through the sewers. Geralt will clear a safe path for us.
    461065|00000000||They'll catch us anyway. You'll see. They'll catch us, and kill us.
    461052|00000000||Perhaps. In which case we'll die with dignity, weapons in hand… Not tied to a stake, begging for mercy.
   1044141|00000000||Gotta take that bottle… Won't get anything done without it.
    580351|00000000||Calm down… What is it?
    580353|00000000||If I could just win at Vartburg this year…
    536681|00000000||Are you crazy?
    536683|00000000||You're kidding, right? We'll give you ten.
    536684|00000000||Geralt, what are you--?
    536685|00000000||Be quiet.
    536686|00000000||You're fuckin' with fire, git. I don't have to haggle with you. Final offer - forty.
    536682|00000000||Fine. Let's get this over with.
    536696|00000000||No, wait.
    536687|00000000||Fine. We'll take your offer.
    536689|00000000||But perhaps we should--
    536690|00000000||You should go home, elf.
   1037928|00000000||Oh, Tinboy. Too much drink - it's softened your bloody mind. This 'ere's Cleaver's territory, ye prick-whittler!
    536697|00000000||Agreed.
    536698|00000000||Pleasure doin' business with you.
    536703|00000000||Fine, no deal.
    536704|00000000||Geralt, what are you--?
    536706|00000000||Wait. All right. Certainly know how to negotiate, "concerned friend." Ugh, twenty-five it is… and the discount.
    536695|00000000||Fine, no deal.
    536701|00000000||Twenty-five's our limit. We'll throw in a discount at the shop.
    536702|00000000||You're clearly daft, tramp. No deal. Come on, boys.
    536694|00000000||Still too much.
    536693|00000000||Fine, not likely to get a better deal.
    536692|00000000||Fine. It's a deal.
    536691|00000000||Too much.
    536699|00000000||Give you twenty-five.
    536700|00000000||Who are you to dictate anythin' to the King of Beggars? Thirty-five's as low as we'll go.
    536680|00000000||Let's negotiate.
    536674|00000000||You were to come alone, elf. Who's this?
    536676|00000000||A concerned friend.
    536677|00000000||Oh. Fine. Here's how we see things. The boss at loggerheads with Cleaver? There's gotta be a pay-off. We've got an offer and it's non-negotiable.
    536678|00000000||Surprise us.
    536679|00000000||A steady supply of iron in exchange for fifty percent of your profits.
    437614|00000000||Wonder what led them here. Hunger... or greed?
    437616|00000000||Hm, a fresh corpse.
    453511|00000000||Must've come here a while after the nobleman's death.
    437631|00000000||Wonder what killed them.
    453513|00000000||Doesn't look like the work of necrophages…
    503003|00000000||I adore the speed, the rush of air!
    503002|00000000||Don't spare the horse!
    503001|00000000||Come on, witcher! Let's see what you're made of!
    577970|00000000||Let's dance.
   1076429|4a15cf07||Birchy the Alchemist
    368068|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    380288|00000000||Here for my reward!
    380290|00000000||What the hell for?
    380292|00000000||For a witch! Recognize who I got? It's Triss Merigold!
    380294|00000000||Merigold?! Come in, then!
   1043697|00000000||Begone! Sod off!
    487059|00000000||It landed right in front of us. I thought we'd breathed our last.
    485031|00000000||Watch out!
    485033|00000000||If I don't survive this, you're to take whatever you want from the fortress!
    487065|00000000||You'll survive.
    487067|00000000||Pffgrr! Let's show this bastard what we're worth!
    485058|00000000||Damned brute!
    485057|00000000||Aarghh!
   1008565|00000000||Got a bad feeling about this.
   1008567|00000000||I'm watchin' you.
   1008561|00000000||What?!
   1008559|00000000||Oh, you have it coming.
   1048672|2f50e968||Botchling
    546042|00000000||Dammit, barred from the inside. Gotta be another way in…
    546168|00000000||Akh akh… No one's been here in a long time.
    546169|00000000||Strange… wall looks like it was put up later than the others.
    546170|00000000||Skeleton in the closet. Happens in the best families.
    546171|00000000||A man… in his thirties, forties, maybe.
    546174|00000000||…"and thus I die, in darkness, of hunger and thirst… Gods, have mercy…"
    551510|00000000||Shit, won't open. Need a key.
    571340|00000000||A journal… A little wear and tear.
    571658|00000000||Couple of pages missing, torn out…
    571659|00000000||Hm. The pages missing from the journal?
    576471|00000000||"Dolores."
    576474|00000000||Lock's damaged. Won't get in there.
    579096|00000000||Somebody lived here once.
    546160|00000000||Hmm… Look like twins.
    546162|00000000||Old woman's brother, must be.
   1012449|00000000||Wonder what door this opens…
   1012450|00000000||Hmmm… Maybe this'll open the barn door…
   1012453|00000000||Hmm… Manor's got a few new tenants.
   1073849|00000000||Hm… Not a single sign of monsters. Locals're either imagining things, or someone's scared them off.
    546039|00000000||Must be the manor the old woman mentioned…
    551491|00000000||Hm, something here. A chest…
    447592|00000000||The rats - why did he need them?
    447594|00000000||Bloody rodents, better to have stuffed them with a poison or crushed them into a pulp with a shovel, but no…
    448306|00000000||Did you see what he did with them?
    496181|00000000||Aargh!
    496180|00000000||You whoreson!
    465940|a12d5aa6||Pillager
   1058195|00000000||Finally. You bloody took long enough…
    451503|00000000||Did you have time to look around? How's the ship?
    451516|00000000||Creaky piece of junk. Wood's rotting, sails're prone to rip like an old pair of knickers, and the--
    580257|00000000||Will we make it to Kovir?
    580236|00000000||Provided you don't run into any storms.
    463909|00000000||I'll signal the others to come.
    580260|00000000||Need any help? Can I play the violin for you, fetch some flowers or bonbons?
    580288|00000000||Don't meddle in other people's lives.
    580290|00000000||Sorry, I must. It's my profession. So… will you ask her to stay?
    580282|00000000||Stay out of other people's affairs.
    580281|00000000||What the hell're you talking about?
    580284|00000000||What the hell's that mean?
    580286|00000000||What… don't tell me you don't plan to beg her to stay?
    580292|00000000||Why do you even care?
    580294|00000000||I adore love stories. Especially the ones that end happily ever after.
    580296|00000000||Hunters! Hunters approaching!
    580298|00000000||Board the ship! We want them alive!
   1007862|00000000||Oy, lads, fancy an outing to find that she-beast?
   1007864|00000000||Mean the smith's lass? Gap-toothed one?
   1007866|00000000||Not a bad idea. Nice tits on her.
   1007868|00000000||I'm talkin' about the shrieker! Wreakin' havoc in the peasants' coops now!
   1007870|00000000||You barmy? Ah, we got us a hero, lookin' to save the common folk.
   1071416|00000000||Ach, the bonnie birds that prance by here…
   1074404|00000000||Teets like full bellows, beggin' to be squeezed.
   1071418|00000000||Ach, Fabian, it's unhealthy, this yen for wenches. It'll be your bane, I tell ye.
   1053945|00000000||Me hands're itchin… Why don't we go at the Black Ones, cut them down 'stead o' sittin' here idle.
   1053947|00000000||Fresh recruit, aren't you? You've not fought yet?
   1053949|00000000||No. But I'm good with a blade. My father was a smith. whatever he forged, I'd take it and train.
   1053951|00000000||You could be the best swordsman in the world… But that won't stop a volley o' arrows or a cavalry charge.
   1053953|00000000||You'll see… Won't be so eager for your second battle. Provided you survive the first, that is.
    496151|00000000||Aaaaa! Aaa! Aa!
   1030537|00000000||"Dance," my eye… I wonder how much she's paid for contorting so awkwardly?
   1030539|00000000||More than we pay our staff, that's certain.
   1030541|00000000||Indeed. And they do honest labor, not wiggle their arses in others' faces.
   1030543|00000000||She wiggles anymore, her tits will pop out of her dress. Has she no sense of decency…?
   1004220|00000000||Gods… Full moon soon!
   1004221|00000000||Bar your windows tight, nail an iron stud in the doorframe…
   1004222|00000000||If only I had milk to leave at the doorstep…
   1004223|00000000||That'd be sure to keep the demons away.
   1053283|00000000||You heard? Adrian's soil's yieldin' pots!
   1053285|00000000||How's that?
   1053287|00000000||Simple. Every pass o' the harrow, some clay pot pops up. Fine ones, too! Adorned and what have you.
   1053289|00000000||What's Adrian think?
   1053291|00000000||He's planted gold coins 'tween his furrows. Says they'll grow him rings and bracelets come autumn.
   1015340|00000000||Yes. Promised to help, didn't I?
   1015337|00000000||Yes.
   1015342|00000000||No. Changed my mind.
   1015344|00000000||A true shame.
   1015338|00000000||Sorry. Changed my mind.
   1015346|00000000||You remember our deal, right? You'll stay till the tournament's end?
    582263|00000000||They should've swept you out with the rest of the scum at the start.
   1046250|e5b9e31a||Ravens' Nest
   1068016|00000000||Calm down, Roach. Just bees.
    433474|00000000||Ca'hbri le! Help!
    546056|00000000||Save me!
    546059|00000000||Let me out!
    401675|00000000||Begone, come no closer… I know whence you come…
    401677|00000000||The powers that protect me… They sense whence you come…
    401679|00000000||Begone… Begone… Begone… The powers will not relent…
    517058|00000000||P-please. Th-those are p-priceless manuscripts.
    517060|00000000||Priceless? Worthless, you mean. Vile. Filthy etchings on every page.
    517061|00000000||Re-reproductions of Z-Zerrikanian cave art. Leave me s-save a p-part, at least.
    517062|00000000||F-f-f-uck off, professor.
    496014|00000000||So, stew any good?
    496015|00000000||Mhm, very, thank you. I'd not eaten in--
    496545|00000000||Clear to see. I'm pleased you like it. Had them prepare a bath for you, once you've eaten. And you could do with some sleep.
    496584|00000000||Gretka in the nook behind the hearth, you in the guest room opposite the kitchen.
    496557|00000000||Thank you. I--
    496588|00000000||Shh. Eat now. We'll speak once you've rested.
    498947|00000000||You'll not see one fucking copper!
   1057957|00000000||Get out before I set my hounds on you!
    498945|00000000||Well, er… mi-might not be yours, the older one, but you've gotsta admit the likeness. It's downright strikin'! So, any chance for that reward?
    498943|00000000||Neither, dammit! I think I'd know my own child.
    498939|00000000||Just who do you think you've brought me, man? That's not me daughter!
    498941|00000000||And the little one?
    589500|00000000||I'll take your head off! Kick it cross the Pontar!
    589502|00000000||You lose your way, pretty boy?
    589501|00000000||King of Beggars can suck my fuck rod!
    589503|00000000||At 'em!
    589504|00000000||All together!
    589499|00000000||Ye daft?
    509858|00000000||Then I said, "Perhaps you should not remove your mask." And she said…
    509860|00000000||Mhm, mhm.
    509862|00000000||Are you listening to me, Ingrid?
    587063|00000000||Geralt of Rivia is in attendance. I saw him.
    587064|00000000||Who? Gerard? Is that the count with the bad teeth?
    587065|00000000||No count, a lowly witcher. And his teeth are in good order.
    589583|00000000||In fact, I'd been meaning to ask you…
    509832|00000000||Seeing her in that mask… Have I told you of what I was reminded?
    509855|00000000||Mhm. I believe you have.
    509857|00000000||Staring into the distance again? Who is it this time?
    395456|00000000||Your arms.
    395458|00000000||Thanks.
    398647|00000000||Never seen better steel in my life. Blade must strike true, no?
    398649|00000000||It's a matter of the hand, not the steel it's holding.
   1032420|00000000||What huh, man? Something gibber interesting?
    384184|00000000||Wait, witcher! When you find my daughter, will you give her this?
    384186|00000000||A rag doll?
    384188|00000000||Uh-huh.
   1053387|00000000||Oh, a returning customer! What can I get you this time?
   1053389|00000000||This time you can give me my coin back. You cheated me. I paid for three ells of fabric and got two!
   1053391|00000000||I beg your pardon! I'm a respected merchant, a member of the trade guild!
   1053393|00000000||Either give me my gold, or I'll go get the guards.
   1053395|00000000||Now, now, no need to involve them a private spat. I'm certain we can reach an agreement…
    422239|00000000||Will you craft something for me?
    422233|00000000||Willing to craft something?
   1086509|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    422241|00000000||Farewell.
    422235|00000000||Farewell.
    422231|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422237|00000000||Show me what you got on offer.
    422229|00000000||Ah! A customer!
    446581|00000000||Apparently, Radovid's vowed to flay Philippa Eilhart alive once he catches her.
   1025911|00000000||He'd do that to his own boyhood nanny?!
   1025912|00000000||If he's dreamt up this punishment for her, imagine what that boyhood was like…
    446579|00000000||Apparently King Radovid despises the Eilhart woman.
   1025877|00000000||Not surprising. I heard he wet his bed when he was a boy. She made him parade before the entire court in his soiled knickers.
   1025903|00000000||Character building, she called it…
   1025905|00000000||Well, it worked. Emperor of Nilfgaard's the only one who has more.
    532416|7fbe6f3e||Rich Townswoman
   1016097|00000000||Oooh… see ye made quick work of it.
   1074568|00000000||Lots of blue jerkins. Interesting.
   1052921|00000000||I tell you, Black Ones'll be here 'fore the snow falls.
   1052923|00000000||Aye. Best start learnin' Nilfgaardian.
   1052925|00000000||Is it a difficult tongue?
   1052927|00000000||Ooh, I dunno… If you know a bit of the elf tongue, it's easier. Got lots in common.
   1052929|00000000||As do nonhumans and the imperials in general. Both vengeful, bloodthirsty and godless.
   1013368|00000000||Hm, dog's gone…
    495611|00000000||Might know your witches, but you're shit at catching them.
    495621|00000000||Yeah - you might know how to handle witches, when they're brought to you in chains.
    495623|00000000||What's that supposed to mean?
    495625|00000000||That you're crap witch hunters if a witcher's gotta do your hunting for you.
    495626|00000000||Listen here, mutant… Since we entered this town, we've made ashes of over a hundred mages, alchemists, dopplers and other vermin. So don't you be tellin' us how to do our jobs, got it?
    380405|00000000||Hands off.
    380407|00000000||Hands off.
    380409|00000000||What'd you say?
    380411|00000000||Argh, sensed it. Knew we couldn't trust him… Witcher, witch… One and the same.
    380413|00000000||So they can burn at one and the same stake.
    433747|00000000||Maybe, but for now, she's my whore.
    433751|00000000||Maybe, but for now she's my whore and I say you can't insult her.
    433753|00000000||Funny you feel that way, but so be it… Now. Philippa. Talk.
   1067789|00000000||[DEBUG] SKIP TO END [DEBUG]
    380454|00000000||Thought I made myself clear - I'll only talk to Menge.
    433729|00000000||Menge don't talk to the likes of you.
    433731|00000000||Well then you be sure and tell him I came by. With my friend Merigold.
    380483|00000000||Fine… Grab her and come with me. But be sure to stay right close.
    433739|00000000||I'll tell your boss. No one else.
    433741|00000000||Don't talk to her that way.
    433743|00000000||Don't talk to her that way.
    433745|00000000||Why not? She is a whore, ain't she?
    433749|00000000||Was I unclear? Don't call her that.
    433755|00000000||Last time I say this. Don't call her that.
    433757|00000000||Why not?
    433761|00000000||Would you be bothered if I cut off her pinky?
    433763|00000000||Yes.
    495612|00000000||You're not gonna do any ripping.
    495614|00000000||You're not gonna rip her tongue out.
    495616|00000000||Cause why?
    495618|00000000||Cause this.
    433514|00000000||What's it they say? Quality over quantity? 'Cause if it were about numbers, you might as well burn herbalists, village healers, hell, entire villages, black cats included…
    433563|00000000||You must think you're funny.
    433565|00000000||Maybe he is, fuck if we know. Thing is, we've no sense of humor.
    433512|00000000||It's about quality, not quantity.
    433510|00000000||I can lead you to Philippa.
    433737|00000000||Actually, think I could tell you a thing or two… It's not just Merigold. I've also tracked down Philippa Eilhart.
    433534|00000000||I'll get you for this, you…
    433536|00000000||Shut your gob, ginger whore! And you spit it out - where's Eilhart?!
    495716|00000000||Try to loosen it, if I were you. Might learn something interesting.
    495718|00000000||For instance?
    495719|00000000||For instance, where Philippa Eilhart's hiding.
    495610|00000000||Got something to offer Menge.
    433366|00000000||Not so fast. I hand her over to Menge himself - or not at all.
    433494|00000000||You reckon we don't know what to do with this witch?
    433733|00000000||Let go, you bastard.
    495609|00000000||Vulgar tongue's got no place bein' in such a pretty mouth. I guess we'll have to rip it out.
    380403|00000000||Wanna talk to Menge.
    368180|00000000||Well, well… Triss Merigold. Given up drowners for sorceresses?
    495596|00000000||Pay's better.
    495598|00000000||It's 'cause they do more harm. What's a drowner do? Pull the odd fisherman from his boat? But the witches, they murder kings. Scheme. Start wars.
    495600|00000000||Don't forget turning your cows' milk sour straight out of the udder.
    495603|00000000||Aaaah!
    495605|00000000||You're done jesting, Merigold. For good.
    495607|00000000||Put her in a cell.
    425297|00000000||I know you… You care about results.
    487993|00000000||Know you well enough to know what matters: results… So I lied. Still say I can lead you to your treasure.
    487995|00000000||Forgive me, Geralt… But after what you just pulled, I'd sooner believe a whore who proclaimed her undying love.
    487997|00000000||Would you believe a sorceress who stands to gain if you get your coin back?
    487999|00000000||Perhaps… I'd still prefer the whore, though.
    379514|00000000||Doesn't matter.
    379535|00000000||What I've learned doesn't matter.
    379537|00000000||Doesn't matter?! Yet you agreed to help me.
    425307|00000000||I am. Doesn't mean I have to confess everything.
    488040|00000000||I'll let your insolence fly this time - but only because his honor the margrave might indeed have something to do with the theft.
    488304|00000000||Didn't mean to hurt you.
    488318|00000000||Sorry, didn't mean to hurt your feelings…
    488320|00000000||Hope not.
    488169|00000000||You're using us.
    488223|00000000||In other words, you're using us.
    488224|00000000||Using you? Never! Merely makin' the most of your mutual bond. Hahaha. Well, lovebirds… I really must be going. Good luck.
    495248|00000000||Thought you'd correct him… Say that we… You know.
    495256|00000000||Could've corrected him yourself.
    495258|00000000||True… But it's not an easy thing to say, is it?
    495250|00000000||You didn't say anything either.
    495249|00000000||Dijkstra doesn't need to know everything.
    495252|00000000||Dijkstra doesn't need to know about my love life.
    495254|00000000||Wise… I'd never choose his shoulder to cry on either.
    488372|00000000||Triss, gotta tell you something… Dijkstra's gold - it's the last thing I care about.
    488374|00000000||Thought as much… This is about Ciri, isn't it?
    488375|00000000||Mhm. Menge's got Dandelion locked up somewhere… And Dandelion saw Ciri.
    488376|00000000||That changes everything. Listen, meet me at midnight by the chapel of the Eternal Fire east of the harbor. We'll figure out a way to get into the hunters' barracks together.
    488429|00000000||All right. See you then… And thanks.
    488326|00000000||But we've strayed from our topic… Got a treasure to recover.
    488322|00000000||Put yourself in my shoes. What would you have said?
    488324|00000000||In your shoes, I wouldn't be worrying about what to say to Dijkstra. At all.
    488314|00000000||What would you have said in my place?
    488215|00000000||Information's out of date. We are not…
    488217|00000000||Yes, I know. You parted a week after the summit at Loc Muinne, in the woods near where the Lixela flows into the Pontar. But you know what they say… Old love never dies.
    488219|00000000||First. First love. Now how the hell…?
    488221|00000000||Mha, that's my secret, lovebirds… Really must be going. Good luck.
    488303|00000000||Didn't have to disagree so… strongly…
    488168|00000000||Triss and I - that's all in the past.
    379589|00000000||Doubt Menge'll admit anything willingly…
    379591|00000000||As do I. Lucky I hired a witcher and a sorceress who've been through so much together to get this done…
    495238|00000000||What's our past got to do with it?
    495240|00000000||A great deal. Lovers will jump into the abyss for one another… Suits my needs perfectly.
    495243|00000000||Namely, it greatly increases your chances of getting out of the hunters' barracks alive - with my treasure.
    379581|00000000||I doubt Menge will say anything willingly.
    379583|00000000||While you sit here twiddling your thumbs?
    433025|00000000||Mhm. So we do your dirty work while you sit around twiddling your thumbs?
    433027|00000000||Darling, when I'm able to make use of someone, I always do. It's convenient.
    433029|00000000||And safe… Come on, admit you're scared of Menge.
    488159|00000000||Of course I'm scared… Bloody dangerous whoreson. Triss would concur, I think.
    488161|00000000||Not in those words… But I do agree with the statement overall.
    432695|00000000||Hm, Menge has been spending heaps of coin lately, though to my knowledge he shouldn't have a copper to his name…
    488461|00000000||So. What now?
    488044|00000000||From what I've heard, Menge spends his nights at the docks, witch hunters' quarters… Maybe pay him a visit, ask where he's holding my gold for me.
    425323|00000000||You're hiding somethin'. And that's one thing I can't stand. Even more than Nilfgaard.
    488029|00000000||But ultimately, this is a business deal, not a marriage. Besides, there must be some truth in all those lies - you're too dense to make it all up on your own.
    425311|00000000||All right, I lied… But only partly.
    425313|00000000||Heard of beasts that are half-lion, half-eagle, maidens who're half-fish… But you'll never convince me there's such a thing as a half-truth.
    425315|00000000||I'll give it a shot anyway. Didn't actually see Henckel - but Menge does have your treasure.
    432648|00000000||Take it you learned this by peering into a crystal ball?
    432650|00000000||Maybe. Trade secret.
    425295|00000000||Menge's got the treasure, really.
    379520|00000000||Henckel told me. Old man's alive and well - faked his own death to escape his creditors.
    379525|00000000||Strange… I had no idea he was in debt.
    379527|00000000||He was. And Menge promised to take care of things in exchange for help with the heist, so…
    383247|00000000||Geralt, how can I put this delicately… Bollocks.
    487806|00000000||If you thought I'd fall for that tale you just pulled out of your arse, you don't know me one bit.
    379512|00000000||Margrave Henckel told me everything.
    379508|00000000||Bothered Triss for nothing. No point examining the bomb.
    383238|00000000||Because?
    487797|00000000||Cause I already know who nabbed your treasure. Commander of the Temple Guard. Caleb Menge.
    487800|00000000||Well, well, Merigold… Your coin stands to come with a side of revenge.
    487802|00000000||Geralt, would you be kind enough to tell me what you've learned? I'm terribly curious.
    487364|00000000||All signs point to Menge.
    487365|00000000||Wait… Why'd you come here?
    487367|00000000||Hang on. Gotta tell my why you're here first. We agreed - if I learned anything, I'd take it to you.
    487369|00000000||So we did… But I was concerned about you. Stopped by to see if everything was all right.
    376925|00000000||Thanks. You can breathe easy now. In the future, though, remember this - I can look after myself.
    376927|00000000||Fine. You look after yourself, and I'll look after my interests.
    376919|00000000||Thanks. Really.
    376917|00000000||You don't trust me.
    376921|00000000||Bullshit. You don't trust me.
    376923|00000000||I trust you as much as you trust me - not at all. Believe me, it's a healthy relationship.
    487398|00000000||Gentlemen… Really feel privileged to witness your battle of wits…
    487400|00000000||...but try to remember - unlike you, I put my life at risk every time I venture out into the streets. Did the same just coming here. So I beg you - can we get to the point?
    487316|00000000||Didn't expect to see you here… Certainly not with Triss.
    487318|00000000||I decided we could use someone who knows a bit of magic. The runes on the bomb - I'm absolutely dying to know what they mean…
    487320|00000000||You dying to know too, Triss?
    487322|00000000||No. Just here for the coin.
    487324|00000000||Ah, Merigold playing the cynical materialist. I love it.
    487325|00000000||In truth, her ideals brought Triss here. She needs gold to save her colleagues… When I recover my treasure, I'll be in a position to help her. Simple as that.
    487345|00000000||Speaking of which, and, pardon my Beauclairoise, have you found out who fucking nicked my gold?
    423188|00000000||Greetings.
    423190|00000000||Oh, here it is, the apocalypse - a witcher's walked into my brothel!
    423192|00000000||What's strange about that?
    423194|00000000||What's strange is you! Everyone knows witchers are freaks, mutants, unnatural. And this here's a decent brothel for whores with principles. Well, spit it out. Got all the same bits in your trousers like a normal lad?
    427565|00000000||Last I checked, everything was where it should be.
    423182|00000000||Like to spend some time alone with one of your women.
    423184|00000000||Course, but you'll take the one I give you. Be choosy, look over the lot, and I'll charge you more.
    423176|00000000||I'd like some time with one of your girls.
   1028763|00000000||Wouldn't mind a round or two of cards. Only need my hands for that. Got those, see?
   1028762|00000000||How about a game of cards?
    423186|00000000||So long.
    423178|00000000||Farewell.
    423174|00000000||Like to buy something.
    423180|00000000||Got anything to sell?
    423196|00000000||So? A bit of lust in your freakish heart after all?
    531997|00000000||Well? C'mon!
    531998|00000000||Bring it on, whoreson! Come here!
    530183|00000000||Sod off, you arsilisk!
    480613|00000000||The day dawns.
    480615|00000000||Ready?
    480616|00000000||As ever. First one to the tower.
    480617|00000000||Mount up!
    558701|00000000||Good folk! Leave not these grounds!
    558702|00000000||Ye cannot break the circle!
    560225|00000000||All is quiet, all is gloom…
    560226|00000000||What beings in the darkness loom?
   1003842|00000000||Ahem.
   1003844|00000000||What the fuck're you doin'? We weren't done conversin'.
   1017530|00000000||Call that a conversation?
   1017532|00000000||Not your ploughin' business. Ye need a smack, is that it?
   1052620|00000000||Will you buy me something pretty, darling?
   1052622|00000000||Of course, dear. What would you like?
   1052624|00000000||From this stall?
   1052626|00000000||Just name it.
   1052628|00000000||Everything.
   1052630|00000000||Splendid. Purchase everything and I'll give you a substantial discount.
   1008524|00000000||Well, well...
   1008522|00000000||Burn all mages!
   1008518|00000000||Don't lose your spirit!
   1008514|00000000||Get out of my sight!
   1008512|00000000||You must be out of your mind.
   1054319|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, I am indebted.
   1025830|00000000||Scallops in white wine, grilled shrimp… Meanwhile folk don't even have bread across the Pontar.
   1025832|00000000||Then let them eat cake.
   1025834|00000000||Duchess Marianna Antonia's famed jest? Well played, Marquise. A fine display of wit and erudition.
   1025836|00000000||You caught the reference, my lord, and so must know history at least as well as I do. Congratulations. More champagne?
   1073877|00000000||Offsod! Or yous throw in soup!
   1053669|00000000||This house… it always been crooked?
   1053671|00000000||Nah, 'course not. They built it straight… then two men moved in. Wanted to break into Vivaldi's bank.
   1053697|00000000||Schemed up this notion they'd dig a tunnel from the cellar o' the house straight to the vault.
   1053699|00000000||But they were sorry miners, didn't reinforce the tunnel. When that collapsed, house went all crooked.
   1015596|00000000||Great idea.
   1015594|00000000||Good idea.
   1015614|00000000||Some other time, maybe…
   1015615|00000000||I understand. Not all stories end the same way.
   1015723|00000000||In that case, I shall be off. Very nice to meet you, Geralt of Rivia. See you again… some day.
   1015595|00000000||Maybe some other time.
   1015591|00000000||…As it turned out, the blue-eyed prostitute was actually his sister. He couldn't believe it.
   1015592|00000000||Oh my.
   1015710|00000000||He asked me to see her again at the House of the Night, and then…
   1015593|00000000||Fascinating story… Shall we go upstairs? You can show me exactly how it ended.
    580316|00000000||Beh, get!
    580318|00000000||I came, I listened, I vomited inside.
   1033464|00000000||You've been in town a while, maybe you can tell me - Radovid and Emhyr, why hasn't either taken the city?
   1033466|00000000||Excellent question. I believe I can clear the mystery up for you.
   1003270|00000000||War requires resources, wherewithal. Novigrad's a large port with a powerful fleet and a treasury overflowing with gold. All that makes it a tasty morsel, tempting for both Redania and Nilfgaard.
   1033517|00000000||I understand the city's walls are high, its arsenals are full of weapons…
   1033519|00000000||Then you don't understand much. True, a siege'd be a long and grueling affair, but more importantly, everything that's valuable in Novigrad could disappear faster than a mayfly's dream.
   1033521|00000000||The Big Four's made it known that should things come to a head, the fleet's flammable. And any assault on the city's sure to touch off riots, during which the Church's coffers could very well be looted bare.
   1033523|00000000||So, anyone wanting Novigrad's wealth, its ships, has no choice but to deal with its criminal underworld.
    362794|00000000||Why hasn't anyone taken Novigrad?
    362823|00000000||What can you tell me about Novigrad's underworld?
    362825|00000000||Got one concept for you. The Big Four - Sigi Reuven, the King of Beggars, Cleaver and Whoreson Junior.
    362827|00000000||Whaddaya call a triumvirate, but with four individuals?
   1033438|00000000||No idea.
   1033440|00000000||Well, there are four, and they've carved the city into spheres of influence. Nothing happens without them knowin' about it and approvin' it.
   1033459|00000000||Rumor is Whoreson recently quarreled with the others, but I know nothin' more.
    362799|00000000||What do you know about the Big Four?
    362724|00000000||Novigrad doesn't seem like a safe place anymore. What's keeping you here?
    362726|00000000||I was keen on startin' my own enterprise, but nothin' came of it. Nevertheless I took on some debt - got to pay it back now.
   1033442|00000000||I'd like to blame it on the war or human treachery. But… the truth is I've but me own thick skull to blame.
   1033444|00000000||Rather not dwell on it, Geralt, if you don't mind.
    362722|00000000||What exactly are you doing here?
    362835|00000000||Nice talking to you, Zoltan. See you later.
    362833|00000000||See you.
    362809|00000000||Saw pyres burning in the main square earlier.
    362811|00000000||Saw burning pyres when I arrived in Novigrad.
   1033261|00000000||Yes, Felicia Cori, a sorceress, that was. The crowd came for the other burned that day.
   1033263|00000000||A doppler, crafty wee bugger who'd spent years masquerading as Chappelle, commander of the Temple Guard.
   1033265|00000000||Twas Caleb Menge who exposed him, executed him, and promptly took his post.
   1033269|00000000||Met that doppler years ago, just after he'd assumed Chappelle's identity and form. Wasn't all that surprised when the Church of the Eternal Fire turned tolerant of freaks, opened up a bit to magic and mages.
   1033271|00000000||Ah well, that's all changed now. Every mage who came here seekin' refuge is now caught in a trap.
    362710|00000000||Zoltan?
   1033259|00000000||Geralt?
    507117|00000000||Decided to join us after all. I'm glad.
    175975|00000000||My, you really are a lousy swordsman. In fact, believe I could teach you a thing or two…
    183342|00000000||Sorry, too busy.
    183379|00000000||Sorry, gotta say no. Schedule's packed just now.
    183381|00000000||As you wish.
    354727|00000000||Nice of you to offer, miss. Very. Afraid I have to say no.
    183354|00000000||Maybe another time.
    183356|00000000||Gladly take you up on that.
    183468|00000000||Not sure I can possibly pass up lessons from such a skilled young lady…
    513976|00000000||Care to explain what this is about?
    514010|00000000||Can someone please explain what this is all about? Which of you met with Dandelion?
    514013|00000000||No need to get angry, instructor. I'll explain.
    354749|00000000||Quiet!
    354753|00000000||Quiet!
    354755|00000000||Ooh, now that's a mentor! Strong and decisive... Perhaps it's time I took take up swordplay?
    183801|00000000||Well? Can I expect any more lessons in future?
    183803|00000000||Sorry, no can do.
    183819|00000000||Where and when?
    183827|00000000||Awfully convincing, miss. Wonder where you learned it. Name the time and place.
    502023|00000000||How's here, tomorrow? Same time as today?
    502089|00000000||See you then.
    502025|00000000||See you, master witcher.
    183815|00000000||You convinced me.
    183817|00000000||Sorry, changed my mind.
    183825|00000000||Sorry, Rosa, afraid I can't at the moment.
    183829|00000000||Farewell, then. Oh, payment for your time.
    183799|00000000||Been a pleasure, but I've got stuff to take care of.
    176009|00000000||Exceedingly nice to meet you. Please come again.
    176007|00000000||I should go.
    358674|00000000||This woman - not a local, right?
    358686|00000000||Hmm... I seem to remember him praising her "melodious Koviri accent"…
    358704|00000000||Makes sense - he referred to her as "Callonetta" a few times. Bizarre names are common in Kovir.
    358748|00000000||Gotta ask Zoltan about this Callonetta.
    358664|00000000||But who knows! The "bard" might've invented her just to make us jealous. Pitiful chorister.
    358666|00000000||I'd say it worked. You've gone all red in the face just talking about it.
    358668|00000000||Your face'll be red when I scratch your eyes out!
    183508|00000000||Who'd Dandelion sing about? Know anything about her?
    358578|00000000||I believe she's a poetess or a trobairitz... Very skilled and exceptionally talented, of course.
    176003|00000000||Dandelion - whose talents did he praise?
    497578|00000000||Dandelion act any different lately? Notice anything strange?
    497602|00000000||Strange? Not really…
    497603|00000000||It's no use, Geralt. She's so enamored she'd hardly notice if he turned into a werewolf.
    502080|00000000||Edna!
    502081|00000000||What? You needn't pretend he followed convention! Remember when he took us to the cemetery?
    502084|00000000||Rhetoric lessons in a cemetery? Unusual even for Dandelion.
    502085|00000000||We set out to visit the graves of celebrated Oxenfurt professors. He ended up quizzing us about Margrave Henckel.
    497611|00000000||Who?
    497623|00000000||Eccentric old coot. Died recently.
    497626|00000000||He'd apparently been an important and generous patron of the arts as a young man.
    497564|00000000||Dandelion act strangely lately?
    183794|00000000||Changing subjects...
    183585|00000000||I want to ask about something else.
    183673|00000000||Wonder how the war's going. Any outcome looming?
    183699|00000000||Papa says much depends on Radovid, and on who captures Novigrad first.
    354868|00000000||What's Novigrad got to do with it? Free city - never taken sides, always stayed out of conflicts…
    354876|00000000||Oh, even children know Novigrad's home to the world's largest fleet.
    354878|00000000||And they say the city treasury's bursting with enough to equip two armies.
    183581|00000000||Wonder how the war's going.
    183583|00000000||Emperor and his cohorts - must be ecstatic…
    183587|00000000||Emperor continuing to push north. Courtiers must be ecstatic…
    183619|00000000||His confidants must be. But papa says that's not likely to last much longer.
    183621|00000000||Why not?
    354817|00000000||Papa says the war's disrupting trade. And people are tired of financing the emperor's adventures.
    183567|00000000||Bet sophisticated young ladies like you know a bunch about politics.
    183569|00000000||We've picked up a few things. What would you like to know?
    183486|00000000||Interested in politics?
    176005|00000000||Why're you in Novigrad?
    183522|00000000||What're two young Nilfgaardian aristocrats doing in Novigrad?
    354800|00000000||Dying of boredom.
    354803|00000000||Papa's a diplomat. He also has many business dealings in Novigrad. He's a member of the Trade Corporation.
    183545|00000000||Takes us along everywhere he goes, and must then find us new tutors in each spot.
    354813|00000000||And so in Novigrad the task fell to the poet Dandelion, Rosa's betrothed.
    354815|00000000||Edna!
    354759|00000000||Listen. I just wanna know one thing - either of you seen Dandelion lately?
    497452|00000000||Edna might have. I certainly have not.
    497453|00000000||My dear sister, I would never spend time alone with a man for whom you burn with a secret passion.
    354761|00000000||Burn with passion? For one who incessantly praises another woman's talents? Afraid I've more sense than that!
    354757|00000000||Calm down, ladies. No poet's worth two sisters nipping at each other's throats.
    354769|00000000||Especially not this one…
    354747|00000000||Easy, ladies.
    354735|00000000||Edna sent Dandelion some love letters. She signed my name. Conceited as he is, naturally he fell for it.
    354767|00000000||I was left to repel the aging bard's advances.
    354737|00000000||Rosa, I had the best of intentions, you know that! I felt you needed help taking the first step… You blushed every time he sang a ballad.
    354739|00000000||He'll next sing at your funeral if you don't stop it right now!
    354733|00000000||Sorry, you lost me...
    354741|00000000||You're not the first to be confused… I'll explain.
    354729|00000000||Not sure I understand.
    354731|00000000||Dandelion mixed you two up?
    354743|00000000||Wait a minute: mean to say Dandelion mixed you two up?
    502071|00000000||On occasion, yes. But then Rosa would quickly set him straight.
    354745|00000000||If you'd shut your catty mouth for a moment, dear little sister, I could explain.
    514005|00000000||Take it Dandelion did too…?
    513975|00000000||Dandelion have trouble keeping you straight?
    513964|00000000||Hang on. So it was you in the garden.
    513966|00000000||Hahah, of course it was me. Why, did Rosa try to play you for a fool?
    513968|00000000||Don't be mad. We've done this since we were children. People have always mistaken us for one another.
    175981|00000000||What are you two lovebirds whispering about?
    183375|00000000||You asked about my relationship with Dandelion? Well, here's the mix-up's mastermind: Edna var Attre, the greatest mischief-maker north or south of the Yaruga!
    183358|00000000||Can't rightly refuse a request from a lady.
    183340|00000000||Gladly.
    175973|00000000||Well, if you're not an instructor, you should certainly be one. Fancy giving me a few private lessons?
   1012321|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1012315|00000000||Welcome, welcome.
   1012313|00000000||A little fornication...?
   1012307|00000000||Stop right there, stallion.
   1012421|00000000||Aaa-aah!
   1012419|00000000||Everything all right?
   1012417|00000000||Greetings.
   1012414|00000000||Gwynbleidd.
   1012411|00000000||May I kill him?
   1004449|00000000||Had the health of an ox, he did… Yet died so sudden!
   1004450|00000000||Folk say he showed no gratitude for a favor granted.
   1004451|00000000||Made no offerin'.
   1004452|00000000||Ladies of the Wood - not to be fooled with.
   1040200|00000000||You're back… Changed your mind? Will you drive off them Skellige roughnecks?
   1002175|00000000||Ugh, fine. See what I can do.
   1002176|00000000||Really? So there are good men left in the world.
   1002172|00000000||All right. I'll help.
   1016015|00000000||They'll stay a few days, maybe two weeks, drink all there is to drink, then leave. Without my doing a thing.
   1002174|00000000||You've no heart, no conscience! No surprise, though, don't know what I expected from the likes of you.
   1002173|00000000||Just not my concern.
   1002169|00000000||What happened?
   1002170|00000000||Islanders, from Skellige… They've taken over Crippled Kate's.
   1015981|00000000||"Taken over"? How's that?
   1015982|00000000||Clobbered the innkeep, tossed out the girls, then set to drinkin'… They've been goin' since yesterday, apparently celebratin' some big loot…
   1015987|00000000||Yeah, sounds like Skelligers…
   1002171|00000000||But you look to be an honest man. Help us. Drive away the hooligans. We've not much, but it'll make a tidy sum if we all pitch in.
    512930|00000000||No idea.
    512944|00000000||I have no idea.
    512928|00000000||For company?
    512940|00000000||To spend time in good company?
    512942|00000000||A king cherishes no one's company.
    512926|00000000||Time killer?
    512936|00000000||To kill time?
    512938|00000000||I have no time to squander, let alone kill.
    512978|00000000||No, I don't.
    512958|00000000||No, I don't.
    512960|00000000||You do not because you are not a king. Pawns see only their comrades at their sides and their foes across the field.
    512962|00000000||A king has a different view of the chessboard. His greatest foes surround him. His own chessmen might trap him. And that is check - and death.
    512964|00000000||You see, witcher, chess is the art of sacrificing your own pieces.
    512966|00000000||Now do you see?
    512982|00000000||No, I don't.
    512986|00000000||No, still don't get it.
    512990|00000000||Appreciate the gesture.
    512996|00000000||I appreciate the gesture, Your Majesty.
    512998|00000000||A king should be severe towards his foes, generous to his friends. Apart from which I'll expect you to return the favor.
    540681|00000000||Geralt. Come to think of it, I too wanted to ask a favor.
    541083|00000000||I've a terrible problem with Ves. Need someone to talk some sense into her. Come see me at the camp - I'll tell you more.
    548708|00000000||Let me think about it. See you, Roche.
    513046|00000000||Radovid's sinking ever deeper into madness, as I see it.
    513047|00000000||I know where to find Junior. Don't really care beyond that.
    515817|00000000||I shall contact you to collect in due course. Now go.
    515819|00000000||And you, Roche - we must speak another time.
    515810|00000000||And also, Junior has lost his purpose. The Big Four is no more.
    512992|00000000||You'd just give me a man? After investing coin and time in him? Can't help but wonder why.
    512994|00000000||Consider it a gesture of goodwill… almost. I'll expect you to return the favor.
    512988|00000000||Why would you just give me Whoreson?
    512855|00000000||I'm looking for Cyprian Wily, Whoreson Junior. I know Redania supports him.
    512857|00000000||Why do you seek him?
    512859|00000000||It's personal.
    512861|00000000||Fair enough, I'll not pry.
    512863|00000000||I have placed Junior in a mansion in Oxenfurt. Very few know this.
    512865|00000000||They'll not let you in unannounced. Thus, you must tell them you've come about the new whores.
    512867|00000000||Junior constantly requests fresh women. I hear he doesn't treat them well.
    512851|00000000||Looking for Whoreson Junior.
    512853|00000000||Had no idea I was going to meet a king.
    513026|00000000||Expected a Redanian spy. Had no idea we'd be meeting a king.
    513028|00000000||When you've an opportunity to omit intermediaries, I'd suggest you avail yourself of it.
    512780|00000000||Unimportant… Let us speak.
    512782|00000000||Why have you brought the witcher here?
    549294|00000000||I think he'd best explain.
    512984|00000000||I think I do now.
    512980|00000000||Yes, I do.
    512968|00000000||Yes, Sire, believe I do.
    512970|00000000||You know shit. You're merely humoring me.
    512972|00000000||I was not speaking literally.
    512974|00000000||First hidden truth: a monarch is always surrounded by fools. Understand?
    512976|00000000||Yes, I do.
    512946|00000000||I play chess to reveal the game's secret.
    512948|00000000||Blood thumps inside these chessmen. You need only listen - and you will hear.
    512950|00000000||Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub… A heart pumping with life.
    512952|00000000||I take a pawn - and hear flesh being rent. I win a piece - and hear screams from the depths of its bowels.
    512954|00000000||I want to break the chessmen open, squeeze the truth from them.
    512956|00000000||Do you see what I mean?
    512932|00000000||For... practice? To hone your thinking?
    512934|00000000||No.
    512924|00000000||For practice?
    512916|00000000||They say it's the game of kings. That chess teaches one to think strategically.
    512918|00000000||What a load of rubbish!
    512920|00000000||Both sides have identical pieces, the rules stay invariably the same. How does this mirror real life?
    548668|00000000||Witcher, do you know why I play chess?
    512777|00000000||Checkmate.
    513036|00000000||Why've you come?
    515739|00000000||Not here to play chess, that's a safe bet.
    515741|00000000||You can go in, Vernon. Alone.
    513037|00000000||This is my friend, Geralt of Rivia. I vouch for him with my life.
    513038|00000000||Geralt of Rivia? Very well. His Majesty will see you both.
    501244|00000000||Not Jerald… Geralt.
    501246|00000000||Oh… Dreadful sorry.
    439838|00000000||I took Dandelion out whoring?
    439836|00000000||Actually, Dandelion's why I'm here.
    501207|00000000||Covered in blood - all of it! So much work, for naught.
    501209|00000000||No need to thank me. It was nothing.
    501210|00000000||Sorry… Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful, but… Everything I had… I just lost.
    184352|00000000||Relax. It'll come off.
    501217|00000000||Relax… It'll come out in the wash.
    501219|00000000||Course it will. Just gotta soak it in white vinegar - but that's not my point.
    501221|00000000||Junior shan't forgive me. Either I close up shop meself, or he'll burn me down.
    501247|00000000||Sorry… Didn't think about that.
    501248|00000000||A woman's lot… Men have their fun, and we're stuck with the mess.
    501354|00000000||Oh well… I suppose I must move to Oxenfurt. Professors need clean undergarments, too.
    184354|00000000||Need to ask you about Dandelion.
   1067260|00000000||You're back… Honestly don't know why! Claimed you'd defend me, then ran for your life?! Pfff, some hero you are!
   1067262|00000000||Id' 'ave done better if you'd never butted in! Might've parleyed with those rogues, agreed somethin'… This way? All I had's been smashed to pieces!
   1067283|00000000||Sorry.
   1067294|00000000||Got nothing in my defense. Apologize - it's all I can do.
   1067296|00000000||Apologize? Apologize? What's that get me when me whole enterprise is gone, finished?
   1067282|00000000||Come on, now.
   1067286|00000000||Come on. Far as I remember, I didn't make you any promises.
   1067288|00000000||Oh, typical! You men always say that! Leave us women to deal with the consequences.
   1067292|00000000||Argh, damn it all. I'll move meself to Oxenfurt. Professors' pantaloons need washin', too.
   1067273|00000000||Need to ask you about Dandelion.
    501276|00000000||Don't know if you remember - we've met.
    501277|00000000||I don't-- Wait, wait! I know you! You're that witcher I near clobbered with a vase when… Well…
    501297|00000000||When you kicked Dandelion out… through the balcony. Actually, he's the reason I'm here. Know where he is?
    497833|00000000||Dandelion ask you about other washerwomen? Not terribly subtle, even for him.
    497849|00000000||Maybe he likes 'em sudsy?
    497855|00000000||Uh, maybe… But what'd he ask about - exactly?
    497861|00000000||Oh, this and that, really… What it's like at the bathhouse, have I got any friends there, what're their workin' hours…
    497866|00000000||I dunno, maybe he's lookin' to hire one for his tavern. Maybe I got all in a huff for no reason.
    497800|00000000||Dandelion asked you about other washerwomen?
    184536|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    501352|00000000||Listen - when I find Dandelion… anything I should tell him?
    361090|00000000||No! I mean… Tell him he's a two-faced snake, but… it would be nice if he dropped by.
    184514|00000000||Thanks, good luck.
    361058|00000000||Who was he with in Harborside?
    361060|00000000||This woman he was with in the harbor… Who was she?
    497799|00000000||Claimed she was his niece from Kovir - hah! Whore-vir, more likely!
    361062|00000000||Corset so tight her eyes were poppin' out her head. His too, come to think of it! An artist or a whore - doesn't much matter as they're one and the same…
    357369|00000000||An artist?
    361086|00000000||Or a whore.
    357373|00000000||Apparently Dandelion was seeing a trobairitz, a blonde, most likely.
    361084|00000000||That's the one! Wait, what was her name… Callonetta! Sounds like an artist, a foreigner and a whore - three in one.
    501318|00000000||Probably out whorin', that hoarse pheasant, that lyin' scoundrel!
    501320|00000000||Ouch… What'd he do to get your goat?
    501322|00000000||Same thing as ever! Prize bullshitter came back, sayin' it was till death do we part this time. And? No more'n a week passed before I spotted him in Harborside, strollin' with some trollop on his arm!
    501324|00000000||Twas the last straw. All those questions 'bout the washerwomen at the bathhouse, then this. I beat 'im black and blue and threw 'im out on his ear!
    501314|00000000||Whaddaya think… Where could Dandelion be?
    501241|00000000||Explain something, if you don't mind… You say I took Dandelion out whoring?
    501242|00000000||So he said. Claimed I was his one and only, but he fell in with the wrong folk - you and that dwarf who always looks like a cow licked him. Said you two were a bad example - wine, women…
    501263|00000000||… song. He pick that habit up from us, too? Gotta have a word with him…
    501151|00000000||Thank you, oh thank you! To think there're men who'll help a stranger outta the kindness of their hearts…
    501203|00000000||Not entirely outta kindness, and you're not entirely a stranger.
    501205|00000000||What're you…? Oh, I know you! You're that witcher took Dandelion out whorin'… Jerald, right?
    544081|00000000||Let's get the hell outta here.
    544080|00000000||For fuck's sake, Tinboy. Quick, clean work, you said!
    544079|00000000||Crap of the gods!
    581784|00000000||You're an arse.
    581786|00000000||What?
    581788|00000000||An ass. An oaf. A twit. Didn't even try to stop her.
    581854|00000000||If I say it's because I like you, want what's best for you, would you believe me?
    581856|00000000||No.
    581858|00000000||Wise.
    581860|00000000||You should stay out of politics. I know it, you know it, and Triss knows it - which is not insignificant.
    581862|00000000||Your other lover - not so much. She's cuddled up to Nilfgaard, and you'll follow her, as always. And one day we might find ourselves on opposite sides of the barricade. It'd be a damn shame…
   1064336|00000000||But, that seems a distant future to me. Right now we should talk about the more immediate.
    581889|00000000||Why do you care about my relationship with Triss?
    581907|00000000||Rather hear why the hell you care about my relationship with Triss.
    586811|00000000||No. She said--
    581958|00000000||Good thing women can be changeable.
    581962|00000000||Good thing women can be changeable.
    581964|00000000||Dijkstra, no offense, but…
    581966|00000000||Leaving. Already gone.
    581969|00000000||Let's go somewhere. I know a spot where we can watch the ships.
    581971|00000000||Lead the way.
    581960|00000000||Thank you. I'm… grateful.
    581957|00000000||Thank you.
    581919|00000000||Geralt, turn around.
    581921|00000000||Not in the mood for jokes.
    581923|00000000||No, I'm serious. Turn around.
    581925|00000000||Triss?! I thought--
    581956|00000000||So did I. But I changed my mind.
    581888|00000000||I'll ask again - got interrupted last time. Why the hell do you care who I'm with?
    581844|00000000||What do you care?
    581843|00000000||Had my reasons.
    581846|00000000||I had my reasons.
    581848|00000000||Course you did. You're an ass, an oaf, a twit.
   1064333|00000000||But even an arse can do the world a favor if one more enlightened tells him how.
   1064391|00000000||Men's fragrance… Acrid sweat… and chestnut balm for aching joints.
   1064393|00000000||Dijkstra.
   1064396|00000000||Ah, those witcher senses. Can't hide a damn thing from you lot.
   1064398|00000000||Same seems to be true for you. Will you ever leave me alone?
   1064404|00000000||Someday, sure. Once I no longer need you.
   1064343|00000000||Scheming? Not the best time.
   1064347|00000000||Sure this is the right time, Sigi? Triss and I just--
   1064350|00000000||Spare me, Geralt. Witchers're stripped of feeling, not one emotion in that body of yours. And I've an urgent matter to discuss.
   1064352|00000000||Mhm. And that is?
   1064416|00000000||Ugh, Dijkstra… might not've heard this, though I'd find that hard to believe, but witchers are neutral on principle, so--
   1064418|00000000||Oh, bollocks. That's a convenient excuse you lot try to hide behind every time the temperature rises.
   1064420|00000000||It's grown hot, my friend, and it grows hotter still. Pyres burn in every city. For mages great and small - your female friends included. For nonhumans. For witchers, soon. Is that the North you espouse, the North you're prepared to live in?
   1064423|00000000||Silence, cards close to your chest… I understand. To slay a king - it's not exactly some bloody nekker contract.
   1064426|00000000||You think on this. Think on what I said. And if you conclude you'd rather change the course of history instead of riding its current to hell, you come find me. At the Passiflora, in the garret. I'll be waiting with my mates.
   1064428|00000000||I'll think about it.
    581904|00000000||So long, Geralt.
   1064412|00000000||I don't kill kings. Just not a regicide, rumors to the contrary be damned.
   1064414|00000000||I know. I'm merely asking for your aid in organizing the assassination. Someone else'll strike the blow.
   1064406|00000000||I don't kill kings.
   1064405|00000000||That concerned about the mages of the world?
   1065920|00000000||You that concerned about the mages of the world? Expect me to believe that?
   1065922|00000000||Actually, yes. But not because I'm sensitive or it gives me a heartache, true.
   1065924|00000000||To my mind, this systematic persecution is foremost a symptom of a far more serious problem: a madman rules Redania.
   1065928|00000000||I served Vizimir, Radovid's father. Was his head of intelligence for more than two decades. Together, we transformed Redania. Made it the North's most powerful realm. Any idea what made it strong?
   1065930|00000000||Its armies, I'd wager.
   1065932|00000000||And you'd bloody lose, you idiot. Mass mobilization, inciting peasants to take up their scythes, straighten them - where's the art in that? Much harder to build a strong state with healthy commerce, manufacturing, solid alliances, progressive science, and fair, independent courts that hand down just judgments.
   1065934|00000000||Vizimir and I managed to do just that - through years of fucking hard work. I will not sit on my hands as that little shit squanders that. Radovid the Stern, my arse. Radovid the Witless, I'd say.
   1065937|00000000||Will you help me, Geralt?
   1064377|00000000||What would you say - how many mages did we save? All together.
   1064379|00000000||Dunno, didn't count… Thirty, maybe, give or take a few.
   1064381|00000000||And how many would you say remain in the North? How many alchemists, healers, herbalists? Two thousand? Three?
   1064383|00000000||Doing a population count? Is that it?
   1064385|00000000||No. I'm concerned. In Novigrad, they had us, we were here… But who'll save those in Rinbe? Ban Ard? Ard Carraigh? Gulet? You know damn well that daft bastard Radovid won't rest till he's killed them all. Every last one. Yennefer and Triss included.
   1064387|00000000||Moving as speeches go. Now get to the point. Why're you telling me this?
   1064402|00000000||Because I want you to help me kill Radovid.
   1064345|00000000||Ugh. Dijkstra… what're you plotting this time?
   1064342|00000000||What're you plotting now?
    582121|00000000||No. She said she preferred women. So, I drank myself stupid and went out whorin'.
    582123|00000000||There a moral in that story for me?
    582125|00000000||No. An instruction: just do what I did.
   1064322|00000000||Later. Once we've spoken.
    581909|00000000||Go for it. What's the harm.
    581911|00000000||As you know my heart fluttered for Philippa Eilhart, back when we both served Redania.
    581913|00000000||One day, I doused myself in fragrances like a whore in a heat wave, put on a pinstriped doublet - they make you look slimmer, you know… And I went to her, told her, Philippa, we've so much in common, and so on. Know what she said?
    581915|00000000||Pinstripes hadn't slimmed you down enough?
    581905|00000000||Sure, why not.
    581884|00000000||Well mate, at least you tried.
    581886|00000000||A sorceress turned me down once. Want to hear the story?
    474866|00000000||Got some information about your family.
    474868|00000000||You've learned something?
    475073|00000000||Let's go inside. It's a bit chilly out.
    474856|00000000||Gotta talk about your family.
    474854|00000000||Death of a family member's always hard.
    474870|00000000||Your loss - it must hurt, bad. But there wasn't anything we could do.
    474872|00000000||No, not now, not anymore. It was too late, that was clear…
    475067|00000000||Shoulda acted earlier, taken them all from this damned Velen.
    475070|00000000||In this hole, this reasty mire… nothing could go right here.
   1049354|00000000||I'll never know which blooms would please my second daughter most. Damn shame…
   1049359|00000000||She brought death down on others. The sooner you start thinking of it that way, the better off you'll be.
   1049361|00000000||Can't deny that. Doesn't make it any easier to live with, though.
   1049357|00000000||Damn shame I'll never learn which blooms would please Dea most. Though it's good to know her spirit's free.
    474850|00000000||There you are.
    474852|00000000||See the hollyhock there? The violet blooms? Brought the plants here from Nazair.
    475054|00000000||Anna had read some story. Insisted on having them. Spent hours tending to them, trimming, pruning. She was so content at that!
    475056|00000000||And them - the frilly ones? Called "birds of paradise" in Zerrikania. But Tamara called them "dragons of paradise." She adored them.
   1046544|00000000||It's grown cold. Come, we'll talk inside.
    460146|00000000||Told him off, didn't I! Shtruck him right in the bollocksh, I did!
    460148|00000000||Well done, old chap!
    469879|00000000||I'm not just some old shod! I'm a count, dammit! Sho I told 'im…
    580436|00000000||Grab the whoreson!
    580387|00000000||We know they're here.
    580431|00000000||A ploughin' mime. Fine. Won't talk? Then die.
    581577|00000000||Aaaaargh!
    562357|00000000||First terror, an uproar, now quiet as a winter morn. I've no doubt the Allgod's grown angry and left.
    562358|00000000||Didn't I tell ye we can't cut corners with 'im?! Didn't I say we'd better take from our young 'uns' mouths than not give to him?!
    562276|00000000||The Allgod demanded six sucklings! You didn't bring but a single scurvy runt! It's no wonder he cursed us! Oy, we're doomed!
   1043147|00000000||You's the one brought soured wine! Curse is your fault as much as mine!
   1038335|00000000||Looks like Cleaver'll need a new clerk.
   1039648|00000000||Hm, shame about Caesar. Though he didn't know shite about fish.
   1039707|00000000||So, got the full set of cards. What now?
   1037814|00000000||Now we collect a shiteload o' coin for them. Let's go.
   1042383|00000000||Got all the cards now.
   1042384|00000000||Took a look at Caesar's collection.
   1039686|00000000||Natalis card - only one missing now. High time we saw Ravvy.
   1037813|00000000||Go. I should contact the buyer, agree on a place to make the transaction. See you, Geralt.
   1042375|00000000||Time to visit Ravvy.
   1042376|00000000||Got a look at Caesar's cabinet.
   1042386|00000000||Looked through Caesar's cabinet upstairs.
   1042388|00000000||And?
   1042389|00000000||No wonder he wasn't eager to show it off. Nilfgaardian armor, a portrait of Emhyr…
   1042426|00000000||Joachim de Wett's skull, Vattier de Rideaux's dagger, the rope they hanged Skellen with…
   1042407|00000000||Ugh, uck, shite. Disgustin' fellow. To think I shook hands with 'im…
   1042408|00000000||Uh, but did you happen to take the rope? I know a few who'd pay a tidy sum for it. Some go in for that sort o' thing.
   1042410|00000000||No.
   1042411|00000000||Ach, if ye say so…
   1075773|00000000||Good idea. Take it by her house when I get a chance.
   1075775|00000000||Triss… is no longer around.
   1075769|00000000||Also found a figurine - Nilfgaardian soldier. Magic spell on it of some sort, but I can't tell what kind.
   1075771|00000000||Triss ought to know.
   1038336|00000000||Ugh. Ehh, you've a soft heart after all, Geralt.
   1039684|00000000||Oh, by the by, splendid job with that last one. Blood splatter nearly hit the ceilin'.
   1053934|00000000||So, where're you from?
   1053936|00000000||Lindenvale. I had a little shop, dabbled in herbalism. But then the war came and--
   1053938|00000000||Tell no one about the herbs. Not a soul.
   1053940|00000000||I… I don't understand…
   1053942|00000000||They hunt witches in Novigrad. Your knowledge of the herbs… it's enough to put you on a pyre.
   1037497|00000000||I love it. Especially the, uh… accoutrements on the wall.
   1046645|00000000||Priscilla picked them.
   1046647|00000000||Well, I must admit, you have great taste!
   1046700|00000000||That's complicated, see. Much more than you assumed. Rautlec's in trouble… Afraid you'll have to do without the placards.
   1046702|00000000||Take it I'm better off not knowing. Ugh, this is disastrous. Well, hope the Chameleon's popularity won't suffer as a result.
   1046815|00000000||No, thanks.
   1046822|00000000||Thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
   1046825|00000000||Have it your way. I, on the other hand, will drink.
   1046888|00000000||Don't remember. Why do you ask?
   1046920|00000000||Hmm… Can't say I remember. Why do you ask?
   1046922|00000000||No reason.
   1046887|00000000||She praised your rationality.
   1046894|00000000||She said something that made me think she's not entirely normal.
   1046896|00000000||What?
   1046898|00000000||That you're responsible, got your feet planted firmly on the ground.
   1046900|00000000||You're pulling my leg.
   1046902|00000000||Not this time.
   1046958|00000000||One thing's eating me. How'd you manage to get the loan from Sophronia?
   1046960|00000000||Ugh. Wasn't easy. She got so excited about our performance, I had to read to her for four hours. Four hours from "The Cloak and the Dagger."
   1046962|00000000||You mean you didn't…?
   1046964|00000000||Are you crazy? Who do you think I am?
   1046924|00000000||Well, well, never thought I'd live to see the day. Dandelion living in monogamy…
   1046926|00000000||I've always been monogamous. Well, near enough. I just changed muses often.
   1046928|00000000||Priscilla another one for your collection?
   1046930|00000000||No. She's its crowning glory.
   1046890|00000000||Mhm. She said you've gained some weight, and that you should bathe more often.
   1046892|00000000||Very funny, Geralt. Shove it.
   1046886|00000000||Yeah. She said you're fat and you smell.
   1046830|00000000||The foreman mentioned he saw you and Priscilla talking…
   1046832|00000000||He saw right.
   1046834|00000000||Aaaaand… she say anything about me?
   1046817|00000000||Why not.
   1046820|00000000||That's my boy.
   1046814|00000000||Gladly.
   1046798|00000000||Guess everything's ready. So when's the opening?
   1046800|00000000||Soon. We start our dress rehearsal in an hour. I just need to nip back home for my dress.
   1046878|00000000||Thanks for everything.
   1046880|00000000||Don't mention it.
   1046813|00000000||Seems my cabaret dreams are about to come true. So, a round to celebrate? I'm buying.
   1046734|00000000||When's the grand opening?
   1046763|00000000||We have, but can't really say how it'll turn out without Polly here… The girls claim they know what they're doing, but it all looks a little like an orchestra without a conductor.
   1046765|00000000||Don't worry, they'll be fine. And if anything goes wrong, we can wave them off the stage, start our concert early.
   1046757|00000000||We haven't, but Polly has! She's priceless! Came in and brought the girls in line before I could say "knickers!"
   1046760|00000000||Premiere'll have the audience on their feet - on their knees - both at the same time!
   1046753|00000000||What about choreography? Prepared anything special for the opening?
   1046751|00000000||What about choreography?
   1046708|00000000||It's not the Rosemary and Thyme anymore?
   1046743|00000000||Never mentioned wanting to change the name.
   1046745|00000000||Rosemary and Thyme wasn't all bad, but it conjured images of Temerian cuisine served by waitresses in peasant garb.
   1046747|00000000||Chameleon's a lot better for a cabaret, apart from which it emphasizes that the place has undergone a transformation. Just… a better ring to it all around.
   1046705|00000000||Rautlec said he'd bring them on his own. Should be here soon.
   1046707|00000000||Great! The best way I can think of to promote the Chameleon!
   1046652|00000000||What about Rautlec? Did you get the placards?
   1037499|00000000||Don't you like it? But I thought a boudoir would be right in line with your tastes…
   1037501|00000000||Oh, you chose it! Well, I'm not saying it's bad, just different, not exactly what I'd envisaged…
   1046634|00000000||You know, now that I think about it, you're absolutely right! A boudoir's the perfect setting for a cabaret!
   1037493|00000000||No… No, not all. But I'd imagined something more… you know, more theatrical.
   1037495|00000000||Well, well… see the crew's been hard at work. Not bad.
   1046826|00000000||How'd you get the coin from Sophronia?
   1046969|00000000||Time's up. Got a few other matters to tend to.
   1046971|00000000||Sure. See you at the opening.
   1046973|00000000||Unless we have to call it off. Where is Priscilla?
   1046828|00000000||Gotta go.
    515760|00000000||Yes, we might've known! The witcher took Fishgulper and fist-ploughed his gob! Near warmed my heart to see him renovate his head!
    516469|00000000||Time to face the sergeant, champion of these lands. You'll find him at Crow's Perch.
   1075574|00000000||There's Jonah still. You can arrange to fight him if you want.
   1075570|00000000||You've still Smithy to defeat. No reason to wait.
   1046956|00000000||Not bad, not bad. Time to try your luck against Jonah… And then there's Smithy at the Inn at the Crossroads. Go to it, friend.
    515751|00000000||We all saw it! Geralt tanned Fishgulper's hide!
    515752|00000000||Ye tricked me. 'Tis true what they say - witchers don't got human hearts.
    515763|00000000||You get the urge to fight Stan again, come back any time.
    515754|00000000||Don't know how it happened, but Fishgulper swallowed the Hammer!
    515755|00000000||Thanks, witcher.
    515757|00000000||Fishgulper wins! Remains local champion!
    515762|00000000||I hereby declare Geralt the champion! If he wants, he can try his strength against Jonah or Smithy.
   1077064|150e14a2||Pirate Leader
    538568|ec216618||Innkeep
   1068516|00000000||Massacred body, bare feet. Another prisoner.
   1065344|00000000||No uniform, no boots. Clearly not a Nilfgaardian soldier.
   1068505|00000000||Someone from the village nearby?
   1065635|00000000||Body's strangely contorted… This one was poisoned.
   1065633|00000000||Rigor mortis suggests poison. Hang on… Liver's gone, chewed out. Necrophages?
   1037164|00000000||What's the ruckus about?
   1046213|00000000||Polly and her half-brained fiancé - they're fighting. She's the only one in this town who knows anything about choreography… and that lummox won't let her work for me.
   1045983|00000000||Ho-ho-hold on - what're you doing here? We were gonna meet at the Rosemary.
   1045985|00000000||We were, but you didn't show. Priscilla started to worry, so I came to see how you were doing.
   1045987|00000000||Priscilla started worrying about me? That's so nice…
   1045989|00000000||Less for her than for you, I'm sure, so let's get back.
   1045991|00000000||Did you not hear what's going on in there? We've gotta help Polly. Why do beautiful women always end up with such dicks?
   1045993|00000000||No idea. Stand back, I'll break the door down.
   1042360|00000000||Wait! Do we have to destroy her house? She keeps a spare key around here somewhere.
   1046018|00000000||Fine, let's find the key.
   1045994|00000000||Let's find the key.
   1045995|00000000||How do you know about this spare key?
   1046003|00000000||How would you know she keeps a spare key around here?
   1046005|00000000||It's not as if we started working together yesterday. Before Polly joined forces with Hubio--
   1046007|00000000||You'd visit her… often?
   1046009|00000000||I'd hide out here while Priscilla and Polly rehearsed at the Rosemary and Thyme. They worked on the dance numbers, I composed.
   1046011|00000000||So, Polly's not one of your--
   1046013|00000000||I never mix business and pleasure.
   1046015|00000000||The one exception being Priscilla.
   1046019|00000000||Who you were just saying is worried about us, so enough of the chatter and start looking.
   1024517|00000000||Polly! Everything all right? Open up!
   1036570|00000000||Ah, the key.
   1045082|00000000||Find anything?
   1044944|00000000||Dammit, now where would she leave…?
   1044044|00000000||Not here.
    480806|00000000||What's your arrangement? He using you?
    489656|00000000||Helping me to survive, actually.
    489662|00000000||Six months ago, if somebody said Triss Merigold would be working for a Novigrad criminal, I'd never have believed it.
    480807|00000000||Six months ago Triss Merigold parted with someone very dear to her and had to start anew.
    489665|00000000||Hasn't turned out like I imagined. Come on, let me give you a taste of my life.
   1051461|00000000||Geralt, I don't have all day.
    562808|00000000||What you reckon - think he'll find something?
    589023|00000000||That cut-throat? Pff, not on your life.
    589025|00000000||He is a witcher.
    562809|00000000||Witcher or not, he'll be dead before you can say two prayers.
   1032886|00000000||Why'd you give your food to that beggar?
   1032888|00000000||Cause he was hungry.
   1032890|00000000||He wouldn't be hungry were he to find paid work.
   1032892|00000000||But he said the Temple Guard interrogated him, put out his eyes.
   1032894|00000000||Yes. That's what he said.
   1032896|00000000||Were he innocent, they would not have interrogated him. And I don't wish to see you talking to riff-raff anymore.
    473322|00000000||Fruit of ground-ivy, leaves of betony… Mashed with hyssop pollen.
    473324|00000000||No, no! Not hyssop… Corydalis! Yes. Corydalis… Or henbane… Two pinches.
    481485|64de033f||Hortensio
   1021176|00000000||Good day, good day.
   1021178|00000000||What're you doin'?
   1021179|00000000||Go bother someone else.
   1023336|00000000||I don't want to hear it!
   1021181|00000000||Where's the guards?! Guards!
   1021183|00000000||Heeeeelp!
   1021185|00000000||Oaf.
   1023338|00000000||They've these special units that do naught but travel from village to village, murderin' folk…
   1023340|00000000||Tis extermination, the extermination of the Temerian nation. And the world watches and does nothin'!
   1034454|00000000||Let the witches burn, I say! Damned war's their fault!
   1021189|00000000||How's a body live amidst such crowds, noise, stench…?
   1021187|00000000||Just hope my man finds some work…
   1021191|00000000||Good day.
   1052171|00000000||Know when the mad bard's place'll open? If it'll open at all?
   1052173|00000000||How would I know? Don't care much for shows. Go to brothels for my fun. One to one performances there.
   1052175|00000000||Ye take your wife with ye, heheh?
   1052177|00000000||Oh, no, no… Maricca'd rather see the shows.
    400382|00000000||Get the witcher! He's mates with the Black Ones!
   1013898|00000000||Murderer!
   1013896|00000000||Mhm.
   1013894|00000000||Hm.
   1013892|00000000||Hey!
    461142|00000000||Merigold. And the witcher.
    461144|00000000||Planned on two pyres. Now we'll have four.
   1072400|00000000||This is them, just as I said. Ploughin' sorcerer and his whore. She's into the witchcraft, too.
   1072410|00000000||Good work.
   1072412|00000000||Take them!
   1072402|00000000||No, I beg you. We've done nothing wrong!
   1072414|00000000||Right. Hear that several times a day.
   1072416|00000000||What… what about my reward?
   1072418|00000000||Reward? Ah, right… Got to go to headquarters for that. We don't pay out rewards.
    422890|00000000||What? Another one? Begone! You witchers're trouble, village has suffered enough!
    369337|00000000||Turn back. Now.
    369341|00000000||Got your first warning. Won't be another.
    580177|00000000||Do not disturb!
    580179|00000000||Drivel! Pure drivel!
   1084494|cdddbc40||Shady Individual
    595620|0001889f||Elf
    379251|00000000||Impossible? Why?
    379257|00000000||Impossible? Why?
    379269|00000000||Hey. Be nice.
    379275|00000000||Gotta ask me nicely. I'm not one of your delivery boys.
    379277|00000000||Pardon my tone. I've grown accustomed to ordering folk around and barking as I do it.
    379271|00000000||Fine. Where should I start?
    379273|00000000||Henckel's home - derelict townhouse south of the main square. You might happen on some trace of this scoundrel we're looking for there. Well, off with you!
    379267|00000000||Where do I start?
    379261|00000000||Old coot's been eating dirt since last winter! Couldn't have been here the day of the break-in!
    385237|00000000||He's dead? I'd not heard…
    385239|00000000||Not surprisin'. The honorable margrave croaked in a brothel, decked out in leather lingerie, so the family held a hush-hush funeral. But I have my sources.
    379263|00000000||Yet… Yet I saw him that fateful day, Mr. Reuven. I'm certain of it.
    379265|00000000||Did you speak to him? Get a good look at him?
    425289|00000000||No… He merely passed by on the way in…
    425291|00000000||So you didn't see Henckel - you saw an impersonator. Think for once! They scooped out your balls, not your brain! And you, Geralt, start lookin' into this.
    379253|00000000||Margrave Henckel? Who's that?
    379255|00000000||Who was that, you mean!
    379249|00000000||Henckel? Who's that?
    376795|00000000||Let's see what's on the bottom…
    514719|00000000||Grate's been removed from the drain, meaning they flushed the bomb down here.
    376797|00000000||Happen! Who used this pool the day of the break-in?
    379235|00000000||Let me see… Berthold Heintz - town councilman, Josef Schveik - brewer… and Margrave Henckel…
    376801|00000000||Henckel? That's impossible!
    379237|00000000||Let's see what's on the bottom.
    379239|00000000||By the way - Happen's not a suspect?
    379241|00000000||By the way… What about Happen? Could've overheard you mention the vault, has access to the bathhouse whenever he wants…
    379243|00000000||Happen has numerous flaws. He's pompous, pretentious, can be a real prick sometimes, ironic as that may sound… But his loyalty's beyond question.
    379245|00000000||How can you be so sure?
    379247|00000000||Witchers know their monsters, spies know their men.
    417872|00000000||You trusted Philippa Eilhart once, too…
    417874|00000000||True. But I didn't pull Philippa Eilhart out of a Koviri prison the night before her execution.
    376782|00000000||Got something?
    376784|00000000||Yeah. Bomb part.
    376786|00000000||Happen! Drain pool four! And bring me the guest book! Chop-chop!
   1011546|00000000||You there, come here!
   1027327|00000000||Blast it…! How heavy is this thing…? Ugghhh!
   1011549|00000000||Shame you didn't leave me to talk to him. He might've known something about the manuscript…
   1011550|00000000||Didn't seem all that willing to chat…
   1011551|00000000||You may be right… Oh well, thanks. Farewell.
   1011545|00000000||Hey, you!
    438216|d14a7918||Redanian
    440032|00000000||I swear it, I'll drop magic for good… if I can only bloody get out alive.
    440034|00000000||You can't, you won't. You've got Radovid and the Church against you. They want magic to vanish, us along with it.
    579813|00000000||Your friend's right. Shouldn't let them intimidate you.
    579815|00000000||What can you know? Your life here's a walk in the park.
    579817|00000000||But there was a time I fled, assassins on my tail. To the Blue Mountains and beyond.
    579819|00000000||I could've stayed there. Disappeared. It would've been comfortable, safe… and cowardly.
    533367|00000000||Hm, must be the names of people Zed sold cards to.
   1043985|00000000||Zoltan oughta have a look at this.
    427813|00000000||A wee minute, witcher.
    427308|00000000||Now I'm curious somethin' mighty… How is it you were off the same bloody night Whoreson tried to kill me?
    427815|00000000||Twas chance, honest! I was at the brothel! I've witnesses!
    427817|00000000||I don't doubt you've found some witnesses, but I do doubt the bit about… chance.
    452701|00000000||Know what? Shite conversation, this. So much bletherin'. We've got nowhere.
    452703|00000000||Lads, you have a chat with him. It's simple - I wanna know where Whoreson is.
    427819|00000000||I've not betrayed you! Not ever!
    452705|00000000||No! No! I know nothin'!
   1072921|00000000||How's your search for Junior going?
   1072927|00000000||Your search for Junior - any luck?
   1072929|00000000||Tomorrow at the latest, the bugger'll be pushin' up daisies.
   1072931|00000000||Care to join the hunt?
    365963|00000000||No deal.
    365974|00000000||Not interested in your squabbles.
    365976|00000000||You figure out what you want, come and see me.
   1072923|00000000||Already looking for Junior on my own.
   1072925|00000000||Shame you didn't come see me first. I'd 'ave helped you.
   1072920|00000000||Started looking for Junior on my own.
   1074168|00000000||Greetings.
   1074170|00000000||What brings you here?
    365980|00000000||Change of heart?
    369803|00000000||With or without you, I will hang Whoreson's stones out to dry. Joinin' forces just seems reasonable.
    369791|00000000||Help me find Junior?
    369795|00000000||I'm about to send my lads around Whoreson's hideouts. Won't say no to a witcher's blade.
    369797|00000000||Lead my men, take the war to Junior, and drag him out of his hidey-hole. Win-win situation, as I see it.
    547191|00000000||Whoreson can't die.
    547193|00000000||Whoreson can't die until I've talked to him.
    547195|00000000||My lads're hot-headed and I like 'em like that. Want to rein them in? Do so on your own.
    365961|00000000||Fine, I'll help your men.
    365968|00000000||All right.
    460036|00000000||Now, I suspect Junior's hidin' at his casino in Gildorf. Either that or near the arena beneath the Bits. My lads'll be there.
    460038|00000000||Find him.
    427154|00000000||Don't know nothin' about no heist! I was off, then - at the brothel all the night!
    536339|00000000||Gentlemen, you've mistaken me for someone else.
    536340|00000000||You're the only one here's made a mistake… Now, stump up some crowns, quick!
   1068840|00000000||Your father's been avenged - thought you might want to know. I killed the shrieker.
   1069044|00000000||Thank you, master witcher.
   1068837|00000000||Killed the shrieker.
    424965|00000000||Take care, kid.
   1068838|00000000||Farewell.
   1019016|00000000||What?!
    580303|00000000||Yes, my prince?
    580305|00000000||Your own farts never seem to stink, but don't be fooled!
    166803|05b6c502||Druid
    482579|724a06e6||Student
    466901|00000000||Are you daft?! Want to get us killed?
    466903|00000000||What's the problem?
    466905|00000000||Wha--? Slaughters a hunter at our doorstep, and then asks what the problem is?! Ploughin' mutant.
    466973|00000000||We can hide the corpse.
    466975|00000000||The whole street saw what happened. The guardsmen'll come. Turn us in!
    466977|00000000||Calm down. We've put you at risk, true. But we'll make it up to you.
    467015|00000000||Get out. Now!
    467004|00000000||[Don't react.]
    467013|00000000||Stop. I'll take it off myself.
    467017|00000000||When I need your help, I'll ask for it.
    467019|00000000||What? Are you angry?
    467021|00000000||Argh… angry? No.
    467031|00000000||They risked it because it paid well.
    467525|00000000||They took a risk, sure. For a hefty fee.
    467527|00000000||Yes. The thing is, they could've taken the coin and turned me over to the hunters. But they didn't, which was extremely honorable by Novigrad standards.
    467529|00000000||Please, don't make excuses for them.
    467531|00000000||Geralt, we could debate morals, or any number of other topics, but I don't have time for that now. You saw what's happening in the city.
    461368|00000000||Don't risk everything for two people.
    461475|00000000||Can't risk everything, everyone for two people. It's unwise… and immoral.
    461477|00000000||I was afraid you'd say that. Fine. Let's go to the Kingfisher.
    461469|00000000||We should help Anisse and Berthold. To write them off like that… it'd be cruel.
    461471|00000000||Fine. But then we need to go now. Clock's ticking.
    461473|00000000||Lead the way.
    461366|00000000||We should help Anisse and Berthold.
    461364|00000000||Sorry, Triss. I can't help.
    439723|00000000||Triss. I can't do this, can't help. Ciri's in danger and… I'm sorry.
    439725|00000000||So am I.
    451146|00000000||Sorry. Shouldn't have said that. I understand. I'm hurt… but I understand.
    451148|00000000||I hope you find her quickly. I hope we'll all meet again someday.
    451150|00000000||We will.
    451152|00000000||And if you change your mind, you'll find me at the Kingfisher. At least for a little while longer.
    580473|00000000||Need to manage on your own.
    461413|00000000||Now you understand my predicament?
    461424|00000000||Mhm. Help two and put all the others at risk… Or go straight to the Kingfisher, abandon the two to certain death.
    461426|00000000||What do I do, Geralt?
    460250|00000000||Won't be easy getting to the port. Lots of guardsmen in the streets.
    451139|00000000||So we won't take the streets.
    465178|00000000||In case of trouble, we were all to meet at the Kingfisher. There's a passage into the sewers from the cellar, and apparently those can get you all the way to the docks.
    451141|00000000||I know the Novigrad sewers. Won't run into any hunters there, but that doesn't mean it'll be safe.
    451144|00000000||That's why I'm asking you. I need you to find the way to the docks, clear the path for the others. And do it quickly. The hunters could figure out our plan any minute.
    461341|00000000||Could find getting to the port a problem.
    461339|00000000||Berthold and Anisse? Who're they?
    461399|00000000||Berthold and Anisse? Who're they?
    461401|00000000||A young couple. He's an alchemist, had a practice in Gildorf. She studied at Aretuza. I'm worried the people who hid them might've turned them in.
    461407|00000000||See. My hosts weren't all bad.
    580664|00000000||How can I help?
    460257|00000000||Everything's falling apart. I don't know where to start.
    461337|00000000||I should get all the mages to the docks as soon as possible, get them on board the ship. But Berthold and Anisse have yet to show up at the meeting point.
    467535|00000000||How can I help?
    467537|00000000||Forget the others, save yourself.
    467563|00000000||Actually, this is the perfect time for a moral debate. We can start by setting some limits on self-sacrifice.
    451111|00000000||High time you forgot about your fellow mages. Saved yourself instead.
    451113|00000000||Would you abandon Vesemir? Eskel? Lambert? Leave them behind just to save your own skin?
    451117|00000000||I understand, you're worried about me, but I can't just pack up and leave them all…
    455561|00000000||I know what awaits those who fall into the hunters' hands.
    455557|00000000||I was worried about you. City's crawling with hunters.
    439695|00000000||I know. We had everything in place, we were ready to sail… but the hunters moved faster.
    451099|00000000||They locked all the gates, placed guards at every corner. All in one night. Then they started searching the city - street by street, house by house.
    451101|00000000||They stop anyone who seems even slightly suspicious. Mostly it's common folk with rabbit's-foot charms or lucky horseshoes… But sometimes they get it right, arrest actual mages…
    467029|00000000||I was worried about you.
    467027|00000000||But they deserved the necklace. They risked a lot just by sheltering me.
    467023|00000000||Sorry… Didn't know if you wanted me to interfere.
    467025|00000000||I didn't. Their behavior - disgusting, I know.
    467007|00000000||Hands off, or I'll cut 'em off.
    467009|00000000||Geralt. You don't need to.
    467011|00000000||I wanna. Grab your things and let's go.
    467002|00000000||Hands off, or I'll cut 'em off.
    466993|00000000||Give us the necklace and get out of here.
    466989|00000000||I'm out of coin.
    466991|00000000||But you've got somethin' else, dear.
   1011662|00000000||Help! Murderers!
   1011658|00000000||Hmm...?
   1011656|00000000||Diddle yourself, pauper.
   1011654|00000000||It's that albino again.
   1011632|00000000||Bastard.
   1011630|00000000||Ah, the laundry won't dry.
   1012145|00000000||Ouch!
   1012143|00000000||Aaaah!
   1012141|00000000||The day approaches…
   1012139|00000000||What?
   1012137|00000000||Freak of nature.
   1012135|00000000||Do my eyes deceive me?
   1012132|00000000||Ugh, you!
    448738|00000000||Graden!
   1086498|00000000||Gwent - play me.
    492362|00000000||See you.
    492353|00000000||See you.
    492352|00000000||Show me what you've got to sell.
    492361|00000000||What're you offering?
    492349|00000000||Hm?
    425361|00000000||You there! Mr. Reuven wants a word.
    425365|00000000||Impatient old bastard…
    434580|00000000||Wha?
    434582|00000000||Nothing. Be there soon.
    425425|00000000||Who do I spy? Why, it's Geralt of Rivia!
    425427|00000000||Ugh… Will you stop following me already?
    434961|00000000||I will. Soon as you tell me where my treasure is.
    496487|00000000||Didn't see it anywhere… And twenty tons of gold is hard to miss.
    496496|00000000||You mean to say you've come to me empty-handed?
    496493|00000000||First off, you came to me. Second, I do have something in my hand… The key to a vault. Found it on Menge.
    496494|00000000||A vault? That I need to find on my own? You've not made things much easier for me. Gimme that.
    489708|00000000||What about my reward?
    489711|00000000||Spare me… I want my reward.
    489784|00000000||Geralt… Do all you witchers have such nerve?
    489786|00000000||Whaddaya mean?
    489794|00000000||How'd you find out?
    489796|00000000||How'd you find out?
    489798|00000000||I ask the questions here.
    489800|00000000||Not true. That was a statement.
    489802|00000000||Come on, Dijkstra. This tough-guy act - doesn't work on me. We're both adults. Act like one.
    489820|00000000||Hahahah! Ah, Geralt… I should have you strangled, but I like you, you bastard.
    489826|00000000||That makes one of us.
    489828|00000000||I know, I know… Oh, the sleep I lose because of that…
    489822|00000000||Can't say it's mutual.
    489821|00000000||I like you too.
    489824|00000000||I like you too… you count without a county.
    489830|00000000||Now that we've professed our feelings for each other… How'd you figure it out?
    489831|00000000||Sensed from the start you were up to something. You didn't haggle about your pay. And then I heard from my sources that Margrave Henckel and Dandelion had rubbed elbows. Wasn't hard to connect the dots.
   1065810|00000000||I take it you've still no idea what happened to Dandelion?
   1065812|00000000||None. Found someone who might know, though. A spy, I guess - signs his name "Yamurlak." Found a letter of his. Just one problem - it only details how to arrange a meeting with him. Makes no mention of where--
   1065814|00000000||A ruined house in Farcorners. Give the signal, and he’ll show up there the same day, just before midnight.
   1065829|00000000||Probably shouldn't ask, but… Dijkstra, how the hell do you know all this?
   1065831|00000000||I draw it all from the flight patterns of birds.
   1065833|00000000||Your sarcasm - it gets tiring, you know?
   1065835|00000000||I've far worse qualities than that. Believe me.
   1065818|00000000||How the hell do you know this?
   1065817|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1065820|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1065822|00000000||No need to thank me. Just paying off a debt. I always do, you know. Even to liars.
    490008|00000000||And a final humble plea. Don't try to fool me again… ever.
   1065806|00000000||Don't bother. I know what happened to Dandelion.
   1065808|00000000||Then take my coin. I always pay my debts… Even to liars.
    490002|00000000||And now… Time to settle things.
    490004|00000000||That a threat?
   1065804|00000000||Quite the contrary. You helped me, witcher, so in spite of everything you've earned your reward.
    489863|00000000||No, I didn't. But I did deign to help you find your treasure, so stop moaning.
    489865|00000000||I jest you not, Geralt. You abused my trust.
    489866|00000000||I can live with that.
    490000|00000000||This time, yes, you'll live.
    489793|00000000||Stop crying. You'll get your treasure back, won't you?
    489790|00000000||What?
    489792|00000000||You knew from the start who robbed me. But you didn't deign to share that information with me.
    489882|00000000||Again.
    489880|00000000||You lied to me.
    489778|00000000||That's all you're going to say? No wry remark? No scintillating joke?
    489780|00000000||Hahaha… You want a knee-slapper? Fine, I'll tell you one. Ready?
    489707|00000000||That's it? No witticism in parting?
    496509|00000000||No. Your gold's in a Koviri bank. Here's the key to the vault that holds it.
    496511|00000000||Well, well… Would've earned yourself a medal if I was in a position to bestow them.
    380199|00000000||Me and Menge… didn't see eye to eye.
    380201|00000000||How badly?
    380203|00000000||Badly.
    380205|00000000||I suppose that explains the smoke… My treasure's not in there, is it? Burning with the witch hunters…?
    490006|00000000||Quite the opposite. Your reward… Earned it, all the same. Triss will get her coin as well, have her chance to fritter it away on foolish ideals.
   1044877|00000000||Uhh, owww… Ahh… owww…
   1044879|00000000||Gods! Can't breathe! Help!
   1044881|00000000||Best begone from here…
   1044883|00000000||We've no hope left.
   1044885|00000000||Melitele!
   1020747|00000000||Alarm! Alarm! It's an ambush!
   1044062|00000000||"Rope with which Stefan Skellen was Hanged."
    301491|1c2e1012||Forktail
    445804|00000000||Fucking degenerate. He so much as touched Ciri, he'll pay.
    445828|00000000||Poor girl…
    445871|00000000||Dammit!
    445874|00000000||Bled to death.
    445876|00000000||Nailed her to the wall…
   1037391|00000000||My friend needs to talk to you.
    582559|00000000||Lads, take the children and Laetitia and leave us.
   1075430|00000000||Our guests wish to speak to me.
   1037392|00000000||Lambert's got something to discuss with you.
   1075422|00000000||I could understand a witcher becoming a hired assassin, but a merchant?
   1075424|00000000||Why ever not? Not one among us doesn't dream of changing our life. I simply did not stop at dreaming.
   1075426|00000000||They say no witcher has ever died in his bed. I aim to be the first.
   1075428|00000000||Remains to be seen.
   1075420|00000000||How'd you become a merchant?
   1037393|00000000||Witchers are sterile.
   1037395|00000000||Witchers can't have children.
   1037397|00000000||But they can have wards. Or take in a woman along with her children, embrace them as their own.
    586361|00000000||Make yourselves at home.
   1005076|00000000||He's a witcher.
    586365|00000000||Very true. Allow me to introduce my wife, Laetitia. And my two little tots.
   1037374|00000000||You know who I am, and I've heard of you. You've been asking many questions about me. That always draws my attention.
   1075372|00000000||What School'd you come out of?
   1075374|00000000||That of the Cat. So few of us left.
   1003886|00000000||Got their arses whipped like a Novigrad whore.
   1003888|00000000||You surprised? They tried to dance with a witcher.
   1003890|00000000||Where'd he come from anyway?
   1003892|00000000||How should I know? You so curious, ask him yourself.
    394070|00000000||Though if not for Geralt, it might've ended very badly.
    394068|00000000||Though it started to get ugly there.
    394074|00000000||Where's Dandelion? Why's he not with you?
    394076|00000000||He's disappeared, vanished around when you did. I'm afraid only Geralt knows what it's all about.
    394078|00000000||We must find him. I'm certain we can together.
    480671|00000000||Will you put yourself at peril again?
    480693|00000000||No, you must not, it's too dangerous. You must remain out of sight, let others handle it.
    394072|00000000||Crowds do like to jeer, but few are willing to fight a witcher.
    362140|00000000||Dudu! We were so worried!
    362474|00000000||I'm fine, I'm all right.
   1049242|00000000||Where you headed with that spade?
   1049244|00000000||Huh? To the swamp, gonna dig up some peat. Where else would I be goin'?
   1049246|00000000||Ye not heard? Poison gasses waftin' about there. And a monster hidin' within 'em.
   1049248|00000000||Argh, these bogs of ours… Can't spit without hittin' some devil or another.
    337658|00000000||You used me.
    337664|00000000||You used me.
    337666|00000000||Oh, please… I merely seized an opportunity.
    337668|00000000||If I'd known you just wanted Alexander's notes, I'd never have helped you lift the curse from Fyke Isle.
    445638|00000000||All right, perhaps I wasn't completely honest, didn't quite toe the line. But I knew you'd manage - you're so manly and all…
    445642|00000000||Geraltie-pooh… wipe that frown off your face, or I might think you don't like me anymore.
    337680|00000000||Aha! Ho, ho… And I always took you for a gentleman.
    445780|00000000||Keira. I can't-- I won't let you do this.
    445745|00000000||Can't let you do that.
    445820|00000000||We can't allow this research to fall into the wrong hands… And Radovid's are as wrong as they come.
    445920|00000000||Please… Don't make me…
    445922|00000000||Shut up and draw your sword.
    445822|00000000||I'll not give you these notes. I'll not give you anything.
    445808|00000000||Thousands of lives in exchange for your amnesty… Might seem a fair price to you. Not to me.
    445764|00000000||Can't let you do that.
    445747|00000000||Thousands may die. It'll be on your head.
    445810|00000000||It's your conscience, but you do know hundreds… thousands could die.
    445812|00000000||What of it? What difference will it make if Nilfgaard's legions die by steel or because of some fucking germs? None!
    445814|00000000||A plague can go wrong, go wild. A sword won't. That's the difference.
   1031278|00000000||Long as you don't piss Lambert off, yes. Emhyr, Radovid - neither'll be able to reach you. Find little in the way of luxury there, but we do have clean sheets.
   1031280|00000000||It's a long way, well beyond the dividing line. But if I keep to the woods until I reach the Kestrel Mountains, I should pass through unnoticed.
   1031282|00000000||So be it. Seems I find it hard to refuse you, handsome. You've clearly a notion of what women want, how they think.
    500681|00000000||Before I go… The notes, I'll take 'em.
    500793|00000000||Yeah, kinda… So before I go, I'll need you to hand me those notes.
    500795|00000000||All right, all right. Take them already.
    500798|00000000||Farewell, Geralt. Or rather, see you soon.
    500691|00000000||So, see you at Kaer Morhen? Beds free of bedbugs… mostly.
    500693|00000000||I long to be there already… See you, Geralt.
    500680|00000000||See you at Kaer Morhen?
    454880|00000000||No. The opposite. When I get there with Ciri, I expect we'll have to battle the Wild Hunt.
    454882|00000000||Unbelievable! Have you even been listening to me?
    454884|00000000||Closer than you think. You're not looking for safety. You want your dignity back. You wanna be Keira Metz, sorceress of the Lodge, not some healer from the swamps who reeks of manure.
    454886|00000000||Giving you an opportunity Radovid won't give you. Go to Kaer Morhen. Show everyone what you're made of.
    454888|00000000||Yennefer was right. You do have some notion of what women want, how they think.
    445890|00000000||Got another option. Go to Kaer Morhen.
    445898|00000000||You believe I'd be safe there?
    445882|00000000||Go to Kaer Morhen.
    445900|00000000||Expect me to pity you…? Because of some bedbugs? You're joking, right?
    445902|00000000||They… They truly did leave you heartless. Get out of my sight.
    445884|00000000||Expect me to pity you?
    445693|00000000||I don't have time for this.
    445699|00000000||All right. Don't have time to argue with you. Do what you want.
    445701|00000000||I need neither your permission nor your blessing. Get out.
    445770|00000000||Right on that count - I don't like this.
    445768|00000000||Do what you want.
    445776|00000000||But it's your life. Gonna hand it to Radovid? Well, quick and painless - hope he grants you that in return, at least.
    445778|00000000||Cute. Thank you, I guess… All the best to you as well.
    445749|00000000||Do what you want.
    445772|00000000||Radovid'll use you. Make you history's villain, the scapegoat. But if that's what you want…
    445774|00000000||Yes, that's exactly what I want. So stop lecturing me and leave me alone. Farewell and a pleasant journey to you.
    445834|00000000||Farewell.
    445840|00000000||Fine. Farewell, Keira… Here's hoping Radovid rolls out the red carpet for you.
    445842|00000000||Shove your sarcasm up your arse.
    445904|00000000||I'm not one to judge… Whatever you think is right.
    445906|00000000||Farewell, Geralt of Rivia. I hope… I truly hope you find your Ciri.
    445886|00000000||Do what you think is right.
    500625|00000000||Shut up for a moment and look at me.
    445869|00000000||See this? Bedbugs, Geralt. Bloody bedbugs! I, Keira Metz, advisor to Foltest and member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, have bedbugs!
    500626|00000000||Think what you will, but I'll not stay in this bloody swamp one day more. Not one day!
    500627|00000000||I shall cross the Pontar, and that means Radovid's men will find me sooner or later. Don't you understand?! I don't have a choice. I will have to parley.
    445863|00000000||This is suicide, Keira. You'll wind up tied to a stake, burned to bolster the morals of the masses while entertaining them.
    445766|00000000||It's suicide.
    445739|00000000||Radovid doesn't forget, and Radovid doesn't forgive. Especially when it comes to sorceresses.
    445741|00000000||He'll make an exception for me. He'll have to. I have something he wants.
    445743|00000000||Please, you don't believe that.
    445760|00000000||Well, you believe Yennefer will stop treating you like a dog someday. Don't see me laughing.
    445762|00000000||I'm going to see Radovid, tell him of this research, whether you like it or not.
    445725|00000000||Radovid never forgets.
    445723|00000000||Radovid's not interested in medication.
    445727|00000000||You're either incredibly gullible… or you're trying to play me again.
    445729|00000000||Whatever do you mean?
    445731|00000000||Radovid has one objective - to defeat Emhyr. Curing Catriona, stopping the plague, won't help him do that. So he'll either burn you at the stake with those notes among the kindling… or he'll make you use them - to create a weapon.
    445733|00000000||Don't be ridiculous. Bacteria cannot be controlled.
    445735|00000000||Not yet… But it's possible in theory, isn't it?
    445737|00000000||In theory it's just as possible for a dachshund to impregnate a she-wolf.
    500332|00000000||I don't have time to debate this, Geralt. I'm going to see Radovid, whether you like it or not.
    445806|00000000||Can't believe we fucked.
    337785|00000000||So you're fine assisting in genocide? That doesn't strike you as incredibly wrong? Really?
    446013|00000000||I can't believe we fucked…
    337787|00000000||Yen won't either when I tell her… Or Triss. Sorry, lost track of who you're currently obsessed with.
    445830|00000000||We're done talking, Geralt. Get out of my sight.
    445832|00000000||Notes first. Hand them over.
    445836|00000000||I'll go soon as you hand me those notes.
    445838|00000000||Then you shall stay here forever…
    445691|00000000||Gimme the notes.
    499886|00000000||All jokes aside - what're you gonna do with those notes?
    499888|00000000||Do you really believe you can call me names and then revert to polite conversation just like that?
    499890|00000000||Get out of my sight… Before I give in to my urge to teach you some manners.
    337682|00000000||Oh, Geralt… shame you didn't talk that way when we fucked.
    337676|00000000||I don't… You're a vile, two-faced, four-tongued viper.
    337672|00000000||I don't like two-faced serpents.
    337674|00000000||Joking aside, what exactly are you playing at?
    337678|00000000||Didn't come here to play games. I wanna know what you're up to.
    500785|00000000||Naturally, you suspect me of the worst. I don't deserve that. My intentions are pure - like a virgin's tears.
    500787|00000000||Alexander was studying the Catriona plague. I'll use his notes to produce medication, perhaps a cure… or at least a vaccine.
    445719|00000000||Mhm. Strictly humanitarian motivations, is that it?
    445721|00000000||No. Strictly selfish ones.
    499932|00000000||The mighty would pay willingly for such a remedy. Can you imagine how much? Take Radovid, for instance. Why, he might even consider forgetting my past associations with the Lodge.
    500765|00000000||What do you want with those papers?
    500789|00000000||Why, I aim to use them to continue important work that a man's tragic death put on hold.
    337660|00000000||What's with the notes?
    328682|00000000||So. Found what you were looking for?
    328684|00000000||Yes, thanks for asking. How are you feeling? Sleep well?
    501601|00000000||The var Attres gave alms last week.
   1011911|00000000||Dance of death, ha, ha!
   1011909|00000000||I'll feed you to the crows!
   1011907|00000000||I feel empty…
   1011896|00000000||Sometimes, I see you in my dreams.
   1011904|00000000||Ready to die, witcher?
   1011902|00000000||Death awaits us all. All.
   1011900|00000000||What a prick!
    374219|00000000||Not how I imagined you looking.
    374229|00000000||So you're the three Crones?
    374231|00000000||Crones? Where d'you get such an ugly word, young man?
    374233|00000000||Village bitches have been gossiping again.
    374235|00000000||There's no limit to how jealous and petty humans can be. Do we look like crones to you?
    401743|00000000||Go ahead, check. Touch me, White-Haired One. Where it pleases you most.
    401540|00000000||What is this tapestry made of?
    401745|00000000||Is it my imagination, or is this tapestry made of hair?
    401747|00000000||Ooh, he's got a sensitive touch.
    401749|00000000||Touch me more, boy, touch me more.
    401751|00000000||Where do you get human hair?
    401753|00000000||Never heard of the Cutting? 'Round here a young boy turns into a man when they cut his hair for the first time.
    401755|00000000||Our sister weaves tapestries of this cut hair. If the weft is straight, happy's the fate.
    401757|00000000||What if the weft's crooked?
    401763|00000000||Then it must be unraveled.
    401542|00000000||Are you cursed?
    401793|00000000||Is this a curse? You trapped in the tapestry?
    401795|00000000||Oh, he's curious.
    401797|00000000||We don't fall victim to curses - we cast them.
    404430|00000000||Place the ealdorman's payment on the stone.
    405883|00000000||Stone bare, stone shear, stone knows, stone hears…
    396503|00000000||The dagger. For you. Ladies told me to give it to you - here it is. The dagger.
    396493|00000000||I'll talk to the ealdorman, but I can't promise anything.
    396495|00000000||Move, woman! Give the young man the dagger!
    480552|00000000||And you, White One - return only once you've completed the task.
    396499|00000000||Aye, mistress. Right. On my way. Dagger. Gotta bring the dagger…
    396479|00000000||It's a deal.
    396477|00000000||Why do I need a dagger?
    396481|00000000||A dagger? What for?
    401845|00000000||When the ealdorman sees this dagger, he'll know we sent you. He'll aid with all.
    374310|00000000||Oh, hard times are upon us, White-Haired One. Brother has turned against brother, the land is soaked in blood. Evil reigns stronger than ever before.
    374312|00000000||A dark power has surfaced near Downwarren. It feeds on hatred and disdain. Destroy the beast, and we will be grateful, tell you all we know about this ashen-haired maid.
    400973|00000000||Dark power? You need a knight-errant, or a witch hunter, not a witcher.
    382094|00000000||The ealdorman of Downwarren will tell you all. Remember to collect payment from him after you complete your task.
    400975|00000000||And now our servant will bring you the dagger.
    374288|00000000||It's clear you met her. Tell me everything.
    374294|00000000||That was blunt. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Tell me, have you got bollocks? Do you fear woodland beasts?
    374274|00000000||What happened to her?
    374272|00000000||She is like a daughter to me.
    374278|00000000||The young woman... She's my daughter by choice, I raised her.
    374280|00000000||Huhuha. If she's shapely, what does it matter?
    374282|00000000||Matters to me.
    374284|00000000||I believe we've hit a nerve! He's bubbling like well-fed yeast.
    374286|00000000||Ooh, that's how I likes 'em.
    374264|00000000||I'm looking for the woman with ashen hair. I know you met her. Where is she?
    374266|00000000||Ooooh, he's impatient!
    374268|00000000||Perhaps he only likes ashen-haired girls?
    374217|00000000||I wanted to talk to you.
    396471|00000000||They speak through you?
    396473|00000000||Someone's speaking through you?
    396475|00000000||Good looking and clever, too. Where've you been hiding, boy?
    370801|00000000||Johnny's a good, good lad. Though the Ladies don't like him, no… "Foul creature," they say. Don't like him.
    367790|00000000||Who are the women in the tapestry?
    370803|00000000||Those're the Ladies.
    374214|00000000||Ladies lovely, with power o'er all,<br>Beseech I thee, answer my call,<br>Before you a worm crawls, wretched and small.
    367792|00000000||How dare you disturb our rest, woman?
    374221|00000000||It was my idea. I need to talk to you.
    374223|00000000||And who is this charming young man? Looks a tasty morsel, he does.
    374225|00000000||Big and strong. Like a taut tendon.
    374227|00000000||Quiet. Let him speak.
    374300|00000000||I'm a witcher. Monsters don't scare me.
    374302|00000000||We've heard a thing or two about witchers, their lust.
    374296|00000000||No.
    374304|00000000||Mind if we stop chatting and get to the point?
    374306|00000000||Hot-headed you are.
    374298|00000000||Cut to the chase.
    465745|00000000||Triss! Thanks be to Melitele!
    440018|00000000||Anyone from the Silverton hideout make it?
    440020|00000000||Odette, Caspar… Ditmer and Janne.
    440022|00000000||Hagen?
    440024|00000000||He… He won't be coming.
    501447|00000000||Bolted shut…
    489603|00000000||Have I won again? My goodness.
    489612|00000000||So, another hand? If you've no more coin, we could play for…
    504140|00000000||Heeey-rup!
    504170|00000000||Heeeeeelp!
    504172|00000000||Dandelion! Dammit…
    491286|00000000||Priscilla, stay here.
    490563|00000000||They're comin'! They're comin' now!
   1048268|00000000||This was a stupid idea.
   1046096|00000000||You're the one wanted to play.
    490567|00000000||Hm, all right, you know the basics, that's clear. Now we can play for real.
   1064306|00000000||Hahahah!
   1074009|00000000||Geralt! All these buggers are done! Now stop fartin' about and go after Dandelion!
    480148|00000000||Geralt! Go after him! Leave these here to us!
    486314|00000000||This ambush is simpler.
    486324|00000000||This ambush is simpler - 'cause Menge was already planning to move Dandelion to Oxenfurt.
    486325|00000000||Dudu just confirms an order everyone knew Menge was planning to give. If he released Dandelion, he'd need to explain why, probably raise suspicions in the process.
    489627|00000000||Fine, she can stay.
    489633|00000000||Fine, she can stay. On one condition…
    490604|00000000||Sure, let's play.
    490601|00000000||Let's play.
    490615|00000000||Don't really feel like it. You two play.
    490602|00000000||Don't feel like it.
    489635|00000000||I know. As soon as the fighting starts, I'm to stand at a distance.
    489637|00000000||Not much happening just yet. And it might be some time 'fore it does…
    489643|00000000||Well, how about a game of gwent?
    489629|00000000||This is no place for her. Something happens, I don't wanna have to explain to Dandelion why she was here to begin with.
    489631|00000000||Need I remind you that you're here to rescue Dandelion, not me? Seems I can take care of myself.
    489646|00000000||Fine. But remember…
    489626|00000000||This is no place for her.
    480612|00000000||Priscilla? What're you doing here?
    485064|00000000||Some child brought a note from Dudu - the convoy will leave at dawn. May I stay with you? I can't stand it, sitting at home, worrying about Dandelion.
    485107|00000000||Never fear, my dear, you'll get your warbler back, just hope he's got his p--
    485121|00000000||Dammit! Gotta watch the rhymes in the presence of a lady.
    489615|00000000||Go back to town.
    489617|00000000||Please… I shan't be any trouble.
    489619|00000000||Aw, c'mon, Geralt, leave it go, let her stay. Look at her, all weepy-eyed… Like my Muttsie when his guts knotted up.
    486321|00000000||Ehh, I suppose you're right.
    486319|00000000||Too suspicious. Think about it - Menge disappears, then shows up with a scar on his face to release Dandelion?
    486313|00000000||Woulda raised suspicions.
    480107|00000000||Seems everything's ready.
    480108|00000000||Aye. Soon as we catch sight of 'em, we'll block the road, 'gainst a whole unit, if need be. And… you know I think it's a great plan all around, and I'm always glad to help…
    485105|00000000||And it's not like I'm not eager to crack some holier-than-thou buggers' skulls, but…
    485110|00000000||Seein' as we've got a doppler, wouldn't it've been easier to have him release Dandelion and-and be done with it?
   1021093|00000000||Good health to you.
   1021095|00000000||What?
   1021097|00000000||You a deserter?
   1021024|00000000||Blast it all, it's pourin'.
   1023324|00000000||Don't rightly know… Maybe it's true, and maybe it ain't?
   1021099|00000000||Please, sir, don't hurt me…
   1021101|00000000||Aaaah! Aaaah!
   1021031|00000000||Watch how you walk!
   1023326|00000000||Surrounded 'em at the ford. Me brother managed to cross, but o' those left, the Black Ones hanged all the men…
   1023328|00000000||And the women, gods… All the women, they…
   1034417|00000000||Radovid is in Novigrad. Vizima will be ours again tomorrow.
   1021028|00000000||No roof over me head, coin's about run out…
   1021026|00000000||Why'd exile have to be our lot?
   1021029|00000000||Greetings.
   1029166|00000000||Take me away, please!
   1029164|00000000||{Neen, neen, neen, neen, neen, neen, neen, neen, neen! } [No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!]
   1029165|00000000||{Neen… Redania me heer ne'slaan… On'gaan me! On'gaan! } [No… Redania won't get me here… Let me go! Let me go!]
   1013854|00000000||Hm?
   1013856|00000000||Greetings.
   1013858|00000000||Hello.
   1013860|00000000||Son of a bitch!
   1042881|00000000||We all gotta die sooner or later. And I tell yous, guarantee yous - you'll sooner die cut down by a bandit than by this white-haired fellow.
   1042716|00000000||Fools and idgits… runnin' from a fire, as if they've seen death itself.
   1042879|00000000||What can he do to yous, eh?
   1037832|00000000||Bloody hell, I just came here to shoe my horse…
    409717|00000000||Step away. Chaplain's praying, can't you see?
    409719|00000000||Do not cast him out, Roderick. All may draw from the well of the Eternal Fire's grace.
    468107|00000000||Approach, witcher.
   1025570|00000000||Out of my sight.
   1025580|00000000||Return once you've burned the bodies.
    566250|00000000||Welcome, traveler. Drink with me, you cocksucker. Fuckin' knock back a few so's my mates'll rest peaceful.
    567862|00000000||Somethin' ploughed 'em up good… But I don't know what it was… Don't know who or what to curse…
   1047731|00000000||Talked to one Brean Hotsch. Told me all about your comrades' death.
   1047733|00000000||Knoblicker… We tried to explain, some horror was prowlin' the forest. He refused to believe it.
    566253|00000000||He's hired me. Wants me to find the beast that attacked you and your friends.
    566256|00000000||Is that so? Well, I take back what I said. Good man, Brean… though a halfling.
    566257|00000000||Tell me about the attack. What do you remember?
    566258|00000000||We were makin' our way out o' the forest, loaded with wood like pack horses. All of a sudden, we heard a bloody howl. Like a wolf's, a pack leader's. We legged it, but then the cart wheel got stuck.
    566259|00000000||Magnus Richter hollered I should run to the hut for the crossbows. So I ran. Come back to the woods… Bloody ploughin' massacre. Couldn't tell me mates apart.
    566260|00000000||Thanks. Really helpful, that.
    567872|00000000||Kill the bugger, will you?
    566244|00000000||Happen to be tracking the monster.
    566251|00000000||No time just now. Take care.
    566245|00000000||Farewell.
    566252|00000000||Oi… Good mates, they were… Gnarled, knotty… Drinkin' mates, loggin' mates, brawlin' mates…
   1055413|f7a0c879||Nekker Warrior
   1054604|00000000||Do you seek to get me drunk, sir?
   1054606|00000000||If I were seeking to get you drunk, madame, we would not be drinking Côte de Blessure.
   1054608|00000000||Why ever not?
   1054610|00000000||It's too expensive.
   1011745|00000000||Tripped a wire.
   1011746|00000000||Another trap. Gotta be more careful.
    595311|00000000||Shit. That didn't shut itself.
   1070291|00000000||Welcome, master witcher.
   1070293|00000000||Till next time, master.
    327808|00000000||Need to see your pass.
    327810|00000000||Don't have one, but I do have a proposition…
    327812|00000000||Need a pass from the esteemed hunters to enter. That, or a morgue worker to vouch for you.
   1070276|00000000||Whoa there! No pass, no passage!
   1070306|00000000||Master witcher! Master Hubert, the coroner? Asked me to convey he's left a parcel for you inside!
   1003908|00000000||Two old turnips for dinner. It's all I could muster.
   1003910|00000000||*Spits* Tastes like flesh off a rottin' corpse.
   1003912|00000000||A human corpse? Now how would you know?
   1003914|00000000||I, uh… heard it somewheres…
    546815|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    546827|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    546829|00000000||Problems with your plumbing?
    546831|00000000||Nah. It's under control. Geralt's a friend from the old days. Although…
    546817|00000000||Need to talk to Sigi.
    546832|00000000||Got something to discuss with Dijkstra… I mean, Sigi Reuven.
    546833|00000000||I think it can wait.
    546834|00000000||Yeah, probably can.
    546818|00000000||None of your business.
    546835|00000000||None of your business.
    546836|00000000||Your friend got a death wish?
    546837|00000000||Heheheh, nah, just short on manners. Witchers aren't exactly the sophisticated urban types.
    551141|00000000||Assassins!
    488395|00000000||Please, no!
    551143|00000000||Aaaaaa-!
    504986|00000000||Bloody hell, I fucking knew it!
    504988|00000000||Any weapons tucked away?
    504990|00000000||Just a few.
    487616|00000000||First ever barney with my prick hangin' out. Harrr!
   1047134|00000000||Got intruders. Someone just snuck inside the bathhouse. Several men…
   1047136|00000000||What the fuck's he on about? Ploughin' fortuneteller.
    546820|00000000||Think I'll let your host introduce me.
    546822|00000000||He's a witcher. The very one who first foiled an attempt on Foltest's life and then killed that monarch.
    546824|00000000||Allegedly. But I didn't kill Foltest. And hello to you, too, Dijkstra… Reuven - whatever they call you these days.
    546825|00000000||Last we met, Geralt thrashed me silly and crushed my ankle. I really wonder what he's got in store this time.
    546816|00000000||Reuven can introduce me.
    488388|00000000||Why the fuck you let him in here?
    451676|00000000||Because I want to talk to him. This is Geralt of Rivia.
    488390|00000000||Good to see you again.
    488392|00000000||As always I'm out of the swivin' loop. Who the fuck are you?
    438655|00000000||Easy, Cleaver…
    438657|00000000||Whoreson Junior's a dead man. I'll have my scribe send you a notice.
    439050|00000000||You don't have a scribe. And we'll eliminate Junior when, and only when, all of us say "aye."
    439054|00000000||Reuven - your guest.
    550587|00000000||Fuckin' talked enough. We're wastin' time, and this is a simple matter.
    550588|00000000||Whoreson got an invite, chose not to come. I'll show you what he thinks of us.
   1039358|00000000||Agreed.
   1039360|00000000||Mhahaha! And here I thought you'd be no fun at all.
   1040968|00000000||Let's play! Let's play!
   1039240|00000000||Agreed, let's play.
   1039339|00000000||I got no use for Ravvy.
   1040965|00000000||Tsk. This witcher's no fun.
   1039241|00000000||Ravvy's no use to me.
   1038820|00000000||How about that, it's the flea-ridden mutant. Join us, please. Ravvy loves company.
   1040924|00000000||Look how 'appy he is to see yous. You 'appy, Ravvy?
   1038822|00000000||Argh!
   1040926|00000000||Sure he'd be happier if you stopped digging the point of that dagger in his back.
   1040927|00000000||Ooohh, you're just sayin' that 'cause you don't know the situation. Our mutual friend Ravvy 'ere was just about to play for his life and, uh…
   1040939|00000000||Ow! You've got the card, what else d'you want?
   1040940|00000000||If you'd just given it up 'stead of tryin' to cheat us, we'd be outta your hair already.
   1040944|00000000||As it is, that's all your fingers broken, so… seems the witcher'll have to play for you. Sound good?
   1040963|00000000||Aaaaargh!
   1040959|00000000||See? Ravvy's on board. Whaddaya say we add some spice to the game, raise the stakes - Ravvy's life and the Natalis card. Fancy that?
    371689|00000000||Looking for the local witch.
    371691|00000000||Look for 'er, then. I know nothin'.
    570934|00000000||You lead.
    459004|00000000||Yes, darling?
    459006|00000000||Albert Vegelbud?
    459008|00000000||For you, my sweet, I can be Adolf Valentino.
    459010|00000000||You don't know anyone here either?
    485892|00000000||See what I can do.
    485893|00000000||Hurry, now! Quick!
    485890|00000000||I'll try.
    485894|00000000||Somebody oughta see to the baron before he burns the castle down.
    485891|00000000||Here to see the baron.
    485887|00000000||Fire! You blind? Nobody willing to put it out?
    485888|00000000||Ain't that simple. Most're afraid! Baron flies into a rage, he takes no prisoners!
    485889|00000000||My brother's in the stable! We've got to save him - he'll burn alive! Him and the horses!
    473008|00000000||Oswin! Where's Oswin?!
    473722|00000000||Anyone seen him?
    473730|00000000||Believe I saw him headin' to the stable.
    473732|00000000||Whaat?!
    473010|00000000||Oswin! My brother! He's still in the stables! Save him!
   1051331|00000000||{A zaagsel ess'blas a morv mol. Aint. } [Rubbish spiced with dead mole. Delicious.]
   1051333|00000000||{Aen lazare'et... Est, est, gerookte hama y gwen'aran } [In the lazaret… they get naught but smoked hams and white bread.]
   1051335|00000000||{Eh, alz esse'pesta... } [Ahh, to fall ill..]
   1051337|00000000||{N'esse iss'kund heer schooiran mar va . Feer ess fallain. } [They don't treat roughnecks like us there. You're better off staying healthy.]
    407545|00000000||Enough! I yield!
   1054857|00000000||Dammit, followed the wrong trail.
   1062902|00000000||Gotta look for a set of single hoof marks, heavily laden horse.
   1032679|00000000||Thought here at least such horrors wouldn't reach us.
   1032681|00000000||Noonwraiths croppin' up 'neath Novigrad's walls. Not a safe place left in the world.
   1032683|00000000||And nary a witcher to be found.
   1032685|00000000||What's true's true. Was a day ye had no trouble hirin' a wanderin' monster slayer, now they're rare as teeth on a hen.
   1032687|00000000||Folk had no respect for 'em, that's why.
   1032689|00000000||Aye, they didn't. And they shouldn't for mutants… Things stripped of all that's human, no better than the monsters they hunt.
    480031|05b8c0e2||Dwarf
   1044866|00000000||Akh akh akh…
   1044864|00000000||Nilfgaardians got medicine! They should help us!
   1044868|00000000||Don't let me die here…
   1044870|00000000||Master!
   1044872|00000000||Eeeee!
   1016076|00000000||Aww, it'll rain in my soup.
   1016078|00000000||Oaf!
   1016082|00000000||Gloomy as a root cellar, y'are.
   1016084|00000000||*Sneezes* Excuse me.
   1016080|00000000||Dill pickle soup for luncheon today. Lovely.
   1016088|00000000||Hey ho!
   1016086|00000000||Murder!
   1018747|00000000||Help! Guards!
   1016090|00000000||Aa aaah!
   1016092|00000000||Come again?
   1078546|206747a9||Crematory Worker
   1061426|00000000||What is this?!
   1062091|00000000||The White Frost! Mage from the Hunt summoned it!
   1061428|00000000||Can you seal those cracks it's blowing through?!
   1061430|00000000||They're too far! We must get closer! I shall shield us with Demetia Crest's Surge!
   1061432|00000000||Stand at my side!

    554451|00000000||{Raenn. } [Go.]
    554452|00000000||Shaent tah'vir!
    554449|00000000||Shaar'az!
    499998|00000000||Not entirely.
    500014|00000000||Not entirely.
    500016|00000000||Tough, you'll need to pick it up as we go along. There's no time to explain everything to you.
    499999|00000000||Yes, all clear.
    500018|00000000||Yeah, all clear.
    499978|00000000||Need something different.
    499980|00000000||Let's keep thinking. That seems a bit…
    499982|00000000||Too fresh? Right you are. Wait, give me a minute…
    499952|00000000||"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph."
    500030|00000000||"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph" - really emphasizes the message we're trying to get across.
    500032|00000000||Comedy.
    500034|00000000||Think comedy's the safer option.
    500036|00000000||Very well. I must get to work. While you… must pick a corner, sit down, read silently… or just think? All right?
    500042|00000000||Fine. Since you don't need help with the writing…
    500045|00000000||Geralt, wait. A rhyme for "witcher"?
    500047|00000000||Errr… "did itch her"?
    500049|00000000||Ugh. Just keep quiet.
    500051|00000000||Hm, you're right. A drama'd be better.
    500031|00000000||Drama.
    499940|00000000||Just one problem - no dopplers in that story. Just a princess and a cursed urcheon.
    499942|00000000||Nothing simpler. We need merely swap the doppler in for the urcheon. The message - that's what's important: a witcher arrives and saves the doppler. Got it?
    499946|00000000||Hm, all right. So it's a comedy?
    499948|00000000||I was thinking more along dramatic lines, but if you'd prefer something lighter… Listen, merely decide and I'll get to work.
    499950|00000000||Let's go with "The Doppler's Salvation." It's shorter, catchier.
    499951|00000000||"The Doppler's Salvation."
    499954|00000000||We need a good title. Venture to say that's more important than the story itself.
    499956|00000000||I've some ideas - perhaps you can choose.
    499958|00000000||Gonna consider my opinion this time?
    499960|00000000||Of course. We're partners in this. I'm just in charge.
    499962|00000000||I've two really good ones: "The Doppler's Salvation" and "A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph." Which do you prefer?
    499963|00000000||Need a good title.
    499964|00000000||Do I get a say in any of this?
    500020|00000000||Will I get a say in any of this? Or have you decided everything already?
    500022|00000000||Why are you cross? It's the nature of the creative process - we toss around ideas and choose the best ones.
    500024|00000000||Meaning yours.
    500026|00000000||Well, you must admit I'm better acquainted with the theater.
    500028|00000000||Naturally, you'll play a part in shaping this play, contribute to the work as a whole. Dandelion will explain how it works later.
    499966|00000000||I've got it! We shall stage the story of the Urcheon of Erlenwald! Secret lovers, their betrothal, a curse, a cruel queen, bells sounding midnight…
    499968|00000000||But--
    499970|00000000||At which point he reveals his face! He's a monster, there to steal Princess Pavetta! They want him dead, but at that instant a witcher steps in!
    499972|00000000||And everything ends splendidly. So, it's settled, yes? You wished to say something?
    499974|00000000||Sounds great.
    499976|00000000||Really think so? Lorenzo Molla, yeah… Hm… Or perhaps not. Wait.
    499977|00000000||Good idea.
    499984|00000000||Now to find the proper expressive form for our content. A gripping, contemporary story - that'd be best.
    499988|00000000||Perhaps about the condottieri of Poviss? I know: Lorenzo Molla. A tale of a handsome but ruthless bandit…
    499990|00000000||…and the doppler who manages to fool him. But now the doppler must hide and can only count on the help of his friend, who's a witcher…
    499992|00000000||…who in turn is prepared to do anything to save his daugh'… No, better - his beloved. Hmm… What do you think?
    499994|00000000||More or less.
    499996|00000000||That'll do.
    499997|00000000||More or less.
    500000|00000000||All right. We can get to work on the play.
    500002|00000000||All right. Guess we can start writing the play.
    500004|00000000||Any ideas for the plot?
    500006|00000000||Actually, I was hopin'--
    500008|00000000||The key is to convince Dudu that he can rely on you. And that we wish to free Dandelion.
    500012|00000000||The message must be clear, though naturally woven into the play's dramaturgical essence, meaning we need an appropriate dramatic structure. Following along?
    499441|00000000||All right. We can get to work on the play.
    499462|00000000||We'll write the thing later.
    499464|00000000||Good. I'll have more time to prepare.
    499466|00000000||You may wish to speak to Madame Irina and her troupe first. You'll find them in the Butchers' Yard off the main market square.
    499468|00000000||Be back soon. See you.
    499442|00000000||Let's write later.
    499443|00000000||Don't know that I can write a play.
    499445|00000000||Not sure I'm cut out to write a play. Maybe you're better off doing this on your own.
    499456|00000000||It's sure to go quicker if you help me. You'll see, we'll have a grand time together.
    479413|00000000||Maybe we could use a play. You know, work a message to Dudu into something. Lure him out of hiding that way.
    479415|00000000||Not a bad idea, but I doubt a few lines would suffice.
    479417|00000000||Besides, do you really think Dudu whiles away his days attending mummings he knows by heart?
    479419|00000000||So what do you suggest?
    479421|00000000||We must write an entire new play, from scratch. Something grand, something that will grab Dudu's attention. So most importantly, it must have a splendid title.
    479423|00000000||It must be the talk of the town. If you wish, we can start on it right away.
    479352|00000000||Maybe a play's the thing… you know.
    479353|00000000||Dudu and the mummers - what's the link?
    479792|00000000||Dudu and the mummers - how'd they meet?
    479793|00000000||That was my doing. Some opening night. Maxim lay comatose in his wardrobe, drunk as an otter. I thought of Dudu.
    479802|00000000||Hard to imagine a better actor than a doppler.
    479804|00000000||And Dudu revealed himself to them, just like that?
    479805|00000000||I didn't think it wise to tell anyone, but Dudu and Irina took to each other completely and right away. He fell so hopelessly in love with the theater…
    479813|00000000||That he started performing with you?
    479818|00000000||Yes. Now Irina feels terribly guilty. They let him put himself in danger. She can't forgive herself.
    479279|00000000||We need to convince Dudu to reveal himself. Any friends we could leave a message with, someone he trusts…?
    479324|00000000||Dandelion, Irina Renard's troupe - that's all, really. I'm not certain he was friendly with anyone else. Spent dawn to dusk with the troupe, on stage or in the crowd…
    479325|00000000||So he liked going to the mummings…?
    493699|00000000||Yes. I'm actually surprised he didn't come to us after it all happened. He certainly could've counted on the foxen's help…
    493700|00000000||Hmm… So if these mummers are ready to help…
    479332|00000000||We need only mention Dudu. Irina and company are deeply indebted to him.
    479232|00000000||We gotta convince Dudu to come out of hiding.
    480568|00000000||How long've you known Dudu?
    480570|00000000||Known Dudu long?
    480572|00000000||I know this might sound strange but…. I can't be sure.
    480574|00000000||It seems he'd been circling me for some time in various forms, trying to attract my attention…
    480576|00000000||Can't blame him for making the effort.
    480578|00000000||Thank you. I failed to notice him at first. Then he decided to shoot the moon, assumed Dandelion's form.
    480599|00000000||What tipped you off? How'd you know it wasn't Dandelion? Dudu not much of a singer?
    480610|00000000||No, he simply spoke about something other than himself.
    479212|00000000||You're his friend - any idea where he might be hiding?
    479214|00000000||With a doppler, the question is never "where," but "as whom."
    479216|00000000||In the past, facing trouble, he'd disappear, then reappear on the morrow as someone else.
    479231|00000000||But this time…? This time he hasn't returned.
    487207|00000000||Think I know how to rescue Dandelion.
    479735|00000000||Think I know how to free Dandelion. Got a plan, but we need Dudu, gotta find him.
    479737|00000000||This… plan? What is it?
    479779|00000000||Our doppler friend will assume Menge's form, order Dandelion moved to Oxenfurt. We can grab him on the way.
    479781|00000000||Brilliant, but how do you aim to find Dudu?
    500080|00000000||Ahh, done. I could make a small masterpiece of this had I a bit more time, but…
    500082|00000000||We're fresh out of that. The hidden message to Dudu - what'd you weave in?
    500070|00000000||Hidden message?
    500072|00000000||You were gonna work something in, like "Come to the Kingfisher at dawn" or…
    500074|00000000||That wouldn't be in keeping with the tone of the play! Not at all!
    500076|00000000||You wrote it to contact Dudu! That was the purpose… Fine, so how do you see this working?
    500078|00000000||I don't know. I was counting on recognizing him by his scar… or just improvising. Shall we worry about that later? First, you must take the script to Madame Irina.
    500068|00000000||Sure you know where to find her? The troupe performs in the Butchers' Yard, off the main square.
    500066|00000000||Join us later. See ya.
    416637|00000000||Not from here, methinks…
    587260|00000000||The gray one again…
    587261|00000000||Door's been swinging off its hinges all day.
    587258|00000000||Made hisself at home! Tracked mud in all over me floors!
    587259|00000000||Maybe she'll finally move in with 'im. High time.
   1000111|00000000||Yes? Who you 'ere for?
   1000112|00000000||Triss.
   1000980|00000000||Told 'er from the start - no men, no pets! 'Tis a decent house, for decent folk.
   1000982|00000000||Don't worry, won't stay long.
   1038520|00000000||A hand, that's it… Archgriffin's had a veritable feast.
   1011945|00000000||Don't you get on my nerves.
   1011947|00000000||Hmm?
   1011587|00000000||Akh akh akh akh…
   1011585|00000000||Good day.
   1011583|00000000||Greetings.
   1011581|00000000||Think you're funny?
   1011579|00000000||Lovely.
   1016073|00000000||Help! Aaaah!
    501600|00000000||We want no trouble, move along.
   1012696|00000000||Traveler! Hello, come sit with us!
    453888|00000000||Ettariel, my love, my maiden fair… Garlands of posies in your flowing hair…
    453890|00000000||Dull, dull, dull! Garlands, posies - they don't interest anyone!
    453892|00000000||Oh, I knew you'd rather go with tits and arse from the start, but I'm an artiste! Ar-teest!
   1011871|00000000||I'll gut you!
   1011864|00000000||Ugh.
   1011862|00000000||Fuck off, human.
   1011858|00000000||Hm?
   1011860|00000000||Piss off.
   1011852|00000000||No!
    584713|00000000||Congratulations. You'd make an excellent jockey.
    590681|00000000||If I were only a foot shorter and five stone lighter.
    590683|00000000||Well, yes… but then I'd not have invited you here.
    590694|00000000||Could've told me.
    590702|00000000||Could've just told me what this was about right o--
    590704|00000000||Ugh. "Geralt, run to the woods and fetch my shopping. I'd like to make dinner." Well, would you have helped?
    590706|00000000||If I'd known I'd get a glass of Zubarran dry in return? Of course.
    590719|00000000||Hm. So we celebrating something?
    590725|00000000||All right, I'm curious. We celebrating something?
    590727|00000000||Yes. A return to the living.
    590737|00000000||Why do you even care?
    590786|00000000||Ugh, why are you even interested?
    590788|00000000||Because I grasp the importance of the studies conducted there. In the wrong hands, the findings could do immense harm.
    590738|00000000||Thought we came here to make love.
    590740|00000000||All right, let's get down to business.
    590742|00000000||What are you talking about?
    590744|00000000||Sex. That's why we're here, isn't?
    590746|00000000||Ah! You may know about wine… but you remain quite unsophisticated otherwise.
    590749|00000000||That's very good. Because boors are better in bed.
    590995|00000000||Now close your eyes… and count to ten.
    590754|00000000||One… Two… Three… Four…
    590997|00000000||All right, that's enough.
    571184|00000000||Your fairytale, your rules.
    571185|00000000||Really? Then close your eyes… and count to ten.
    571182|00000000||Don't have to ask me twice.
    590775|00000000||Sorry. There's someone else.
    571186|00000000||Sorry. Just not in the mood.
    571187|00000000||Is it a headache? Or does the problem lie elsewhere in your anatomy?
    590779|00000000||Ugh. I knew we shouldn't have had that wine before dinner…
    571252|00000000||Will you at least lie down and gaze at the stars with me?
    590828|00000000||Hmm… Why not.
    590831|00000000||Know what they call that constellation in Zerrikania?
    590833|00000000||Dragon something, I bet.
    590835|00000000||No, it has a different name… A bit indecent, actually. Lean closer and I'll whisper it in your ear.
    590837|00000000||Egvane navr.
    590798|00000000||Sorry… There's someone else.
    590800|00000000||So what?
    590802|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt. You're so old-fashioned.
    571183|00000000||Not in the mood.
    590790|00000000||Ugh, I'm sorry. Such a gloomy subject to broach… I simply shouldn't have - not during our romantic dinner.
    590792|00000000||Romantic? Thought we came here as friends.
    590794|00000000||Friends… with benefits.
    590839|00000000||So?
    590782|00000000||Didn't destroy that workshop, if that's what you're asking. Didn't see any reason to.
   1000984|00000000||If Alexander's findings were to fall into the wrong hands…
    590784|00000000||Although… Fyke Isle has a terrible reputation. None even dare go there. Perhaps there's nothing to worry about.
    590736|00000000||Didn't destroy the workshop, if that's what you're asking.
    590729|00000000||But that's not what I wished to discuss. Thank you once again, Geralt, for your help with the tower. You were fabulous.
    590731|00000000||Not the first curse I've lifted.
    590733|00000000||But among the most difficult, correct? What happened on that island… Why, I shiver at the thought.
    590735|00000000||And the laboratory… I sincerely hope you burned everything - the cages, the corpses, the papers…
    590721|00000000||How - if you don't mind my asking? I mean, you'd think the only work to be had in Velen would be in farming.
    590723|00000000||Hah. Very true. So, I've two options. I can either start cultivating turnips or... leave.
    590718|00000000||How's that?
    590708|00000000||Well, well… never took you for a wine connoisseur.
    590710|00000000||Think witchers suck the marrow out of drowner bones and wash it down with puddle water?
    590712|00000000||More or less. Well, we've chatted long enough on empty stomachs. Let's dig in.
    590715|00000000||Must've cost you a small fortune. Sure you don't need me to pitch in?
    590717|00000000||Please, I manage. You know, a dozen eggs here, a cock or gander there… Besides, my finances are about to improve.
    590696|00000000||Beef in cinnamon and cloves, roasted capon with shallots… It was worth the trouble.
    590698|00000000||Shall I pour the white or the--?
    590700|00000000||Dry red. But let it breathe a little first.
    590693|00000000||It was worth the trouble.
    590691|00000000||Now do you see why I needed those… substances?
    584714|00000000||I thought you a better horseman.
    590686|00000000||For the record, I was riding a mouse.
    590688|00000000||For someone who usually trots around on a Roach, that shouldn't present a challenge…
    326897|00000000||Edges curled out… Something inside blew it wide open - wall, too.
    377232|00000000||Hmm… Bathhouse drain pipes seem to converge here…
    409667|00000000||Should've paid 'em more.
    464749|00000000||What're you doing in Velen?
    464751|00000000||Why'd you come all the way to Velen? Not many to sell to around here.
    464753|00000000||There's the baron. Perhaps you've heard of him?
    465297|00000000||Worth the journey just to sell to him?
    465299|00000000||We'd never've set course for these gods-forsaken lands if it wasn't.
    465301|00000000||And we've not much competition - that's the upside.
    409680|00000000||Thank you. Please, this was to be theirs at our destination. Now it's yours.
    409675|00000000||Hiring thugs - not a good idea these days. Need someone you can trust to guard a caravan.
    409678|00000000||I cannot afford to enlist anyone permanently.
    474303|00000000||Where'd you find these men?
    474305|00000000||Former Temerian soldiers, they claimed to be. Of all people, I thought they'd know the trade.
    474307|00000000||Knew it all too well, in a way…
    409669|00000000||Never trust a mercenary.
    388628|00000000||Damned cheap guards - you get your coin's worth! Even less! Thank you, witcher! Where would I be without you?
    388661|00000000||Your guards run off?
    388663|00000000||Louts didn't get the chance, thank the gods. It's them you cut down. Waited until we had passed the last settlements, then attacked!
   1027715|00000000||And to think I made sure the scoundrels were well-armed! We stood no chance against them!
    409671|00000000||Probably decided you weren't paying them enough…
    409673|00000000||Nonsense. I paid them more than they were worth. A rumor went about that ghouls and other such monstrosities prowled the roads…
    474277|00000000||They demanded more, as no one else dared ride this way.
    474279|00000000||Think these boys could've handled some monsters?
    474281|00000000||They fell to a solitary witcher… so I truly doubt it.
    424893|00000000||Cards lining up today?
    424895|00000000||A mutant? What the hell's a witcher doing here?
    454892|00000000||See any drowned dead, or other shitzards around here?
    440171|00000000||Really gotta talk to the owner. Know where I can find him?
    440173|00000000||I don't know squat.
    454896|00000000||But wait a moment…
    440175|00000000||Gentlemen! This here rogue wishes to speak to the owner! Any of you know where Junior is?
    440167|00000000||Gotta talk to Whoreson.
    440177|00000000||Thanks for the warning.
    440179|00000000||Someone's nice to me, I try to be nice to them.
    440181|00000000||At any rate, let's play, shall we?
    440169|00000000||Let's play.
    424901|00000000||Not hunting shitzards tonight. Looking for the owner of this establishment.
    427433|00000000||Awww…. Someone asked after him yesterday.
    440163|00000000||Who?
    424903|00000000||You know, I don't know. They crushed his head before I could get a good look. Man's swimming with the fishes now.
    427437|00000000||Whoreson's always been touchy. But this, this is going too far.
    424869|00000000||The owner - where is he?
    424871|00000000||We playing or not?
    424905|00000000||Nope, no monsters. Great opportunity to play some cards.
    427439|00000000||Clever man, eh? All right, we'll play, provided you've coin.
    427441|00000000||I do.
    424907|00000000||Fisstech? They've got the best powder in the city right here.
    424909|00000000||Just wanna play.
    396677|00000000||If you insist…
    396679|00000000||I believe I will plough your arse like a cheap whore's…
    396673|00000000||Let's play.
    396681|00000000||Sober up. Then we'll play.
    396683|00000000||Hahah - that never happens.
    396675|00000000||No thanks.
    407634|00000000||Hello again.
    396671|00000000||Got the urge to play, have you?
    396685|00000000||I'll not play you anymore. You're bad luck. Go ruin someone else.
    398198|00000000||Look on the bright side. Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.
    396687|00000000||Hee hee hee! Took a beating, lad. But come back with coin, and you'll get a chance to win it back.
    414226|00000000||Bloody stripped me to the bones. How am I to buy fisstech now?
    509684|00000000||But… How could he… with that scrawny harlot!
    500917|00000000||Come now, don't cry. After all, he's not the only man in the world…
    500918|00000000||But he's a baronet! Where will I find another baronet?

    590045|00000000||Veered off the road at high speed. Doesn't bode well.

    449197|00000000||Not a man alive south of the Yaruga could go toe-to-toe against Hal and me!
    449199|00000000||Will the North surrender now, or is there someone man enough to face us?
    449214|00000000||Here and now - pack this whole Great War into one fight!
    449216|00000000||North versus South! Who's brave enough to stand and face the Black Ones?
    449189|00000000||Who wants to be next?
    449191|00000000||Who's not afraid to face Hal of Metinna?
    449193|00000000||Straight outta Nilfgaard, the Black Ones' great hope…
    449211|00000000||Awaits a worthy opponent!
   1004437|00000000||I'll say this once, so listen careful.
   1004438|00000000||Your young 'uns, they need a mother. And you need a wench in the house. Time you remarried!
   1004439|00000000||But I… I can't forget me Beth.
   1004440|00000000||Then don't, but start to live again.
   1004441|00000000||Think yours were the only Beth the Black Ones killed?! Argh… you've mourned enough.
    400561|00000000||You must let us pass! Have a heart, sir…
    400563|00000000||Got orders to turn the likes of you around.
    400565|00000000||But we've nowhere to go. Naught but blood and mayhem there. Death, everywhere…
    400567|00000000||Orders are orders. Back you go.
    424208|00000000||I wanted to--
    498698|00000000||I know what you want. To buy somethin'. Or maybe sell.
    498699|00000000||But let's get one thing straight. You'd not get shit from me had Roche not ordered me to trade with you. My supplies are for the army, not for stray mutts.
    498701|00000000||So I'll show you my wares, 'cause those're my orders. But then get the fuck outta here fast as those freaky legs'll carry you. And I'd appreciate you not coming back.
    424210|00000000||Just show me what you got.
    424202|00000000||Fine… so show me what you got.
   1086505|00000000||Be a sport - let's play gwent.
    424214|00000000||So long.
    498711|00000000||Piss off.
    424206|00000000||Farewell.
    424204|00000000||I'd like you to craft something for me.
    424212|00000000||Willing to craft something for me?
    498705|00000000||You again.
    426750|00000000||Help! Please help, master!
   1071962|00000000||[Play Gwint]
    582603|00000000||[Win.]
    582604|00000000||[Loss.]
    582601|00000000||Let's begin.
    511195|00000000||Shite. Cleaver wants this bunghole searched, so I'm searchin'.
    502018|00000000||Hope Dandelion gets out of this alive…
    502021|00000000||Dammit… Hope Dandelion gets out of this alive…
    502022|00000000||And in one piece. Know what they do to bards? Break their fingers, or tear out their tongues… Or both.
    502035|00000000||Relax, I'll get him out of this. Gotta talk to this Whoreson first - and Sigi Reuven. Know where I might find them?
    502037|00000000||I don't know about Whoreson but Reuven runs a bathhouse. Careful, though… he's a dangerous character.
    502050|00000000||So am I.
    502055|00000000||I don't doubt it… but Dandelion's not. I beg you to hurry. Let me know as soon as you learn anything.
    502020|00000000||Here I go again, rushing to Dandelion's rescue… He oughta pay me a salary.
    502039|00000000||Wherever he is, I sincerely doubt he's in the mood for jokes. Nor am I, in fact.
    502017|00000000||Looks like I gotta rescue Dandelion… again.
    501994|00000000||Lemme guess - attempted heist was a failure?
    501996|00000000||Well he's not driven up in a gilded carriage laden with jewels, so I should think so.
    501998|00000000||I've asked after him everywhere, but it seems an army of tongue-stealing cats has overrun the city. I learned only that he raised a ruckus at Whoreson Junior's lair. Then Whoreson's men chased him all over town.
    502008|00000000||Whoreson Junior… Doesn't ring a bell.
    502010|00000000||Biggest prick in Novigrad. Not literally, but…
    502012|00000000||Got it. You're not a fan. But what'd he do to you?
    502016|00000000||Try the whole town. He's one of four bosses who control the city's underworld - the others being Sigi Reuven, Carlo "The Cleaver" Varese and the King of Beggars.
    502063|00000000||The rascal… At least he didnae cross the Church as well, bring that venerable institution into it. We'd be in deep, then.
    501945|00000000||Take it the heist was a bust?
    501971|00000000||Dandelion breaking into a vault… I'd sooner expect him to choose a life of celibacy.
    501973|00000000||True… Forgot to pay for his wine at the Passiflora once. He laid awake the next three nights worryin' about it.
    501986|00000000||Any idea what got into him? He have debts he needed to pay off?
    501988|00000000||He claimed he was helping someone. An urgent matter that couldn't wait, he said.
    501990|00000000||This "someone" - Dandelion mention their name?
    501992|00000000||No… But if I know Dandelion, it's "her" name he failed to mention. As he failed to mention "her" slender waist and ample bosom.
    501947|00000000||Breaking into a vault… what was Dandelion thinking?
    501946|00000000||Reuven? Who's that?
    501969|00000000||Reuven… What's he like?
    502000|00000000||Tall… Fat… Dangerous as hell.
    502002|00000000||Limp in his gait - left leg.
    502004|00000000||Sounds like a lame rock troll.
    502006|00000000||If trolls were devilishly intelligent and had a flair for crime, yeah, I'd agree.
    420798|00000000||There a reason for all this sneaking around?
    500060|00000000||An excellent one… When last I saw Dandelion, he told me he was planning a heist - Sigi Reuven's vault…
    501933|00000000||… Sheep dip…
    501935|00000000||… And I've not seen him since.
    431575|00000000||Wraith that haunts the village - heard you can tell me about it.
    431580|00000000||Oh, aye! I saw her, saw Jenny o' the Woods with mine own eyes. Like I sees you now, witcher.
    432776|00000000||What did she look like? In detail, please try.
    439760|00000000||Truth be told I didn't see her too clearly. It were growin' dimpsy and this pale shape loomed afore me, mist-like.
   1019169|00000000||I comes closer, and the cloud thickened, and somethin' like a visage came out o' the mist.
    439762|00000000||What did you do?
    439764|00000000||What do ye think, me luv? That I'd wait to see the wraith in full glory? Ran to the village to tell folk what I'd seen.
    439766|00000000||I see. So she appeared to you just after twilight? Important clue, thanks. You take care now.
    401384|00000000||I don't blame you.
    401526|00000000||Your father's a vile man. You're angry and bitter - can't blame you.
    401528|00000000||Why do you help him then? Why did you take this job?
    401512|00000000||You're right, he's a jackass.
    401522|00000000||You're right, your father's a jackass.
    401524|00000000||Glad we agree. But in that case, why are you helping him?
    401396|00000000||Because he knows something about someone dear to me. Promised to tell me if I found you and your mother.
    401458|00000000||Got it. A bit of blackmail - just his style.
    401460|00000000||We'll, now you've found me, you can tell him I'm alive and I'm never coming back.
    401649|00000000||I know where your mother is.
    179548|00000000||Voytek said some monster carried off your mother.
    401684|00000000||That is what happened. It was enormous, twice the size of a bear, but much quicker and more agile. It grabbed mum before we could react. Now I don't even know if she's alive.
    401686|00000000||Your mother's in Crookback Bog. Seems quite happy, actually. Though I think she's not quite right in the head.
    388388|00000000||What?! She lives?! I must go there at once and get her out!
    388390|00000000||Wouldn't recommend venturing into the swamp.
    388392|00000000||I've made my decision. Won't let anyone talk me out of it.
    371861|00000000||Tell me your side of the story.
    388177|00000000||Before I agreed to look for you, your father told me his version of events. Tell me yours.
    388179|00000000||Mine? It's dull as life amidst the swamps. My earliest memories are of a drunken father lying under the stairs, caked in mud and clutching a bottle.
    401538|00000000||Next dozen years, pretty much the same. Father would drink, disappear for days, then come home in a rage and send furniture flying. Thank the gods for war. I was glad every time they sent him off.
    388203|00000000||And the quarrels… I remember him screaming at mum, the thuds as he beat her, then her sobbing. I'd hide under my bed and long for silence.
    388181|00000000||That's the long and short of it. Multiply by nineteen and there you have my life. Finally we'd had enough, mum and me. He crossed the line and we fled.
    401645|00000000||Tell me your version.
    401647|00000000||Anna had a miscarriage, right?
    401651|00000000||What'll you do now?
    388474|00000000||Hope you know what you're getting into.
    388476|00000000||I've never been more certain. The Eternal Fire is the best thing that could happen to me.
    402364|00000000||In that case… good luck.
    402377|00000000||Thank you for respecting my choice. Farewell.
    179614|00000000||Before you go, your father asked me to give you this.
    179616|00000000||Clara? Father told you to give me Clara?
    388444|00000000||Funny how he thought to buy me back with a memory. Tell him one gesture could never make up for a ruined childhood.
    402421|00000000||So long, witcher. In spite of all I'm… well, I'm grateful you gave me a choice, didn't force me to go back to the tyrant.
    388466|00000000||Hope you know what you're getting yourself into. So long. And good luck.
    402341|00000000||Where are you gonna take her?
    402343|00000000||Tamara must rest. She's had a harrowing experience. When the warmth of the Eternal Fire has restored her strength, we shall see about finding her mother.
    401709|00000000||Where will you take her?
    402269|00000000||So the baron hired a witcher to find his daughter. Interesting.
    401765|00000000||Glad you know who I am. Haven't introduced yourself, though.
    401785|00000000||Graden, witch hunter in the service of His Royal Majesty Radovid of Redania. I'm certain you've heard of us.
    402217|00000000||Rings a bell.
    402221|00000000||If the Bloody Baron sent you to fetch his daughter, you'd best face it - you will fail in your task.
    402261|00000000||I appreciate your concern, but I don't need it. As for Tamara, she can make her own decisions.
    402273|00000000||Hmm, akh akh… Noble of you. A killer for hire abandoning his bounty for the good of another. The hunters and the Church of the Eternal Fire thank you.
    401815|00000000||Who are you?
    401711|00000000||The baron's desperate.
    401717|00000000||Desperate fathers have been known to do a lot to find their daughters.
    401719|00000000||Unexpected from a witcher. Akh akh… I thought your mutations cleansed you of humanity, stripped you of emotions…
    401721|00000000||You don't need mutations to strip men of their humanity. I've seen plenty of examples.
    350947|00000000||Well, well… a witcher. Never thought the baron would stoop to hiring a monster slayer. Though I hear you're good at tracking things down.
    388409|00000000||What about your father?
    388412|00000000||Who? Oh, him. I don't care. I won't go back to him. That bit of my life - forgotten it already.
    402169|00000000||What about your father?
    402167|00000000||Who are these friends?
    388401|00000000||Who are these friends? If it's not a secret.
    402157|00000000||No secret. Heard of the Church of the Eternal Fire? A priest helped me contact the Redanian witch hunters. Righteous, brave men. They'll help me.
    402205|00000000||Wouldn't be so sure of that. Been to Novigrad. Met the leader of the city's Temple Guard. Man named Menge. One mean son of a bitch.
    402210|00000000||Doesn't mean they're all like that. Most are good, well-meaning people. I know they'll help.
    402171|00000000||Hence the candlesticks in your room. So, you believe in the Eternal Fire.
    402173|00000000||Once the heat of the Fire has set your heart aflame, it gives you strength and leads you down the path of truth for the rest of your life.
    402201|00000000||I hope it'll bless you with its warmth one day.
    402203|00000000||Thanks. Thing is, fire's tricky. It's easy to get burned.
    388383|00000000||What will you do now?
    402161|00000000||Find my mum.
    402163|00000000||You realize that might not be that easy.
    402165|00000000||Don't worry, I'm not daft enough to believe I can do it alone. I've got some new friends now. Powerful friends. They'll help me.
    371872|00000000||What will you do now?
    388185|00000000||Voytek claims your mother had strange marks on her hands… and that a monster dragged her into the woods. That true?
    388187|00000000||We were riding towards the river. Suddenly mum cried out, bent over, almost fell off her horse. I rode up to her and saw something strange - her hands were on fire.
    401662|00000000||And then that creature leapt from the woods! I don't know what it was but it roared so fierce my nose bled. I saw it topple trees - I've never been so scared in my life!
    388381|00000000||That… that thing grabbed my mum and disappeared into the woods! I wanted to turn back, go after them, but the horses panicked! Now I don't even know if she's alive.
    388183|00000000||What happened to your mother?
    388379|00000000||Why'd your mother miscarry?
    388353|00000000||I don't mean to pry but… I know your mother had a miscarriage.
    388357|00000000||His doing! He shoved her, she fell - that's how it started. We were alone, no one to help, blood everywhere… Worst night of my life.
    388359|00000000||Sorry… must've been hard, for you both.
    401640|00000000||Mum was in shock, she was raving that it was better this way, that she never wanted the child! Must've had a fever - she was losing blood the whole time.
    414126|00000000||She didn't want the child?
    414128|00000000||Said she'd sooner cut open her gut than bear another child from his seed.
    401514|00000000||He's no saint, that's clear. But he's got the whole province on its feet, looking for you.
    401532|00000000||Finding you and your mother - seems to me there's nothing more important to him now. I know evil men. He's not one of them.
    401516|00000000||Shame he never showed such concern before. Especially for my mother.
    401518|00000000||He made a mistake and knows that. I'm not defending him, just saying that maybe he's come to realize what he's done. And what you mean to him.
    401520|00000000||Oh wonderful, I'll bear that in mind. Did you really come all the way here just to tell me that?
    401462|00000000||He cares about you both.
    401386|00000000||Got every right to be angry at your father, but he's worried about you.
    401388|00000000||I have a right? Thank you kindly. So good to have the approval of his hired thug! And my father worries only about what to get soused on next.
    401382|00000000||Father's worried about you.
    371724|00000000||You're looking for me. And who might you be? My father send you?
    371878|00000000||Yeah. To see if you're still alive. And well. I'm Geralt of Rivia.
    371930|00000000||I'm quite alive and extraordinarily well, Geralt of Rivia. Better than I've ever been in this rotten life of mine. And now that you've seen me, I bid you farewell.
    388189|00000000||Wait…
    388191|00000000||We've nothing more to talk about.
    350941|00000000||I'm looking for Tamara, the Bloody Baron's daughter. Your brother said I'd find her here.
    350943|00000000||Voytek send you, sir?
    371716|00000000||How else would I know she was here?
    371722|00000000||Wait a moment. I'll fetch her straight away.
   1051525|00000000||Thanks for the invite.
   1049486|00000000||Congratulations. Quite the win at the Vegelbuds'. Luc's one hell of a prick, but I don't recall him ever losin' before.
   1051527|00000000||And seein' as you outran him, you actually stand a chance at Palio. Make some real coin.
   1051529|00000000||Fine, I'll race.
   1049494|00000000||Lovely, color me thrilled. Just don't bloody let me down, 'cause I'm about to bet a small fortune on you.
   1051531|00000000||Go prepare. Drink some chamomile or whatever the fuck you do.
   1049489|00000000||Fine, I'm in.
   1051533|00000000||Don't feel like racing anymore.
   1049496|00000000||Shame. You're passin' on an arse-load o' coin. We've a bit 'fore it starts - so come back if you change your thinkin'.
   1049492|00000000||Not in the mood.
   1049490|00000000||What's the Palio?
   1051535|00000000||Palio? Never heard of it.
   1049498|00000000||Fuck me, what a peasant. The Palio's a race held at night in the city streets. Used to be every district sponsored a competitor. Things are different now.
   1051537|00000000||You're gonna race jockeys put forward by Bedlam and Reuven, but my coin's on you.
   1049488|00000000||So what'll it be?
   1051551|00000000||I'm fuckin' done here. Stay outta my way for a while.
   1051549|00000000||We gotta get the fuck outta here. Thanks, Geralt!
   1049507|00000000||Temple Guard! Scatter!
   1049504|00000000||Give us a kiss, Geralt!
   1051543|00000000||No? Then I'll smooch that Roach of yours. That were lovely!
   1051545|00000000||And my pay?
   1051547|00000000||Take it, you cheeky bastard. Never met a man who earned his coin fairer than you did today.
   1049502|00000000||Great fuck. Could've whittled meself a jockey outta birch, stained him with piss and he would 'uve done better than you.
   1051539|00000000||Shit happens.
   1051541|00000000||Aye, it sure fuckin' do. That's business - sometimes you kick the cow, sometimes it kicks you.
    426218|00000000||I'll go to the woods, see if I can't find him.
    442889|00000000||Thank ye! I've coin, I'll pay ye…
    426214|00000000||I'll go see what happened.
    426220|00000000||I'm sorry. Can't help you.
    442891|00000000||You just say that 'cause you don't wanna help! Fine, I'll go meself. But if somethin' eats me, it's on your head!
    426216|00000000||Sorry. Can't help you.
    426210|00000000||Why're you crying?
    426212|00000000||Me… me betrothed went to the woods to see to his snares… didn't come back… Somethin' must've happened, heard him scream but was afeared to go there meself…
   1052282|00000000||Have you talked to your neighbor? How's she feelin'?
   1052284|00000000||If your husband set out on a voyage and never came back, how would you feel?
   1052286|00000000||My husband was never drug outta the worst dives in Novigrad, day in and day out.
   1052288|00000000||Think he drank himself to death?
   1052290|00000000||It's possible. That or someone knifed him, tossed his body in the channel.
    480540|00000000||How about that - takes a tired old man not to panic and run when I appear.
    506260|00000000||Must know I'm a witcher. He fearless or just doesn't care?
   1068199|00000000||Whoreson Junior sends his regards!
   1040303|00000000||House of yours in White Orchard? Pretty nice. Thing is, you forgot to clean it out before setting off.
   1040305|00000000||Shite. Thought I'd covered me tracks. How'd you find it?
   1040307|00000000||By accident, that took the form of a frying pan. Long story. Here's your monocle. It's broken but could still be useful.
   1040301|00000000||Nice house you've got in White Orchard.
   1036476|00000000||It's been a while. Fill me in.
   1036478|00000000||Nilfgaard fuckin' dismantled the Temerian secret service in one night. I barely escaped with me life. Proceeded to drown me sorrows till my liver screamed bloody murder.
   1036480|00000000||What do you do now?
   1036482|00000000||Grassroots work. I hang about the area, watchin', listenin', askin' questions, and recruitin' new agents.
   1036465|00000000||Been a while since we saw each other.
   1041089|00000000||Yeah, I do, most of the fuckin' time, thanks.
   1041091|00000000||Farewell.
   1018968|00000000||So long.
    507960|00000000||How are things?
    507962|00000000||Life treating you all right?
    507963|00000000||Meh, bit like a potato beetle. I keep quiet, stay outta trouble and live on fuckin' potatoes.
   1038756|00000000||Hm?
    489167|00000000||He's gonna help me find someone.
    489157|00000000||Junior's gonna help me find someone.
    489159|00000000||Whoreson's not helped a soul in all his miserable life.
    489161|00000000||I'll ask him nicely.
    489163|00000000||See, Cleaver? Perhaps if you'd not called Junior an uncle-fucker and "asked him nicely," he'd 'ave showed up today.
    489126|00000000||Hope I find Junior before Cleaver does.
    489141|00000000||I need to find Whoreson. Now looks like I gotta get to him before Cleaver does.
    489143|00000000||Cleaver won't find him easy. Junior's good at hiding. He's got… peasant smarts.
    489145|00000000||Look at the time. Good luck in your search, witcher.
    489147|00000000||I'll call on you tomorrow, Francis. We'll finish our chat.
    489139|00000000||So, how about we get dressed?
    550589|00000000||Sure, sure - then we'll talk. In private.
    489128|00000000||Any clue on Junior's whereabouts? Be grateful for any lead.
    489130|00000000||Sigi?
    489132|00000000||It's worth a try. Geralt's got a knack for finding people. And he's discreet - a value in itself.
    489134|00000000||Leave you to it, then.
    489136|00000000||I'll, uh, look in on you tomorrow, Francis. Finish our talk.
    489124|00000000||So where will I find Junior?
    489150|00000000||Gentleman, you out of your fucking minds? A chat session? Whoreson's out to get us, and he'll succeed, eventually. We've got to kill him first.
    489152|00000000||So by all means, you sit here, soak, fart and watch the bubbles rise, while I send my boys to Whoreson's hidey-holes. They'll make some noise, flush the bugger out.
    489154|00000000||And you, Geriatric, or whatever your ploughin' name is - wanna find Whoreson? Find me first.
    489199|00000000||It's personal.
    489201|00000000||Hahaha, Geralt takes his privacy very seriously. Spyin' on him, havin' him followed, was a bloody nightmare.
    489203|00000000||Still, uh, he was lots more trusting when he was looking for Merigold.
    489165|00000000||Personal matter.
    489169|00000000||I'm looking for Whoreson Junior.
    489171|00000000||Interesting.
    489173|00000000||What do you want with him?
    489175|00000000||Gotta see Whoreson. Talk to him.
    489189|00000000||How are you… Reuven? Disappeared for a few years there, only to reappear here in Novigrad…?
    489191|00000000||Oh, I've been here, there. Spent some time in Zerrikania, matter of fact.
    489193|00000000||Hm. What'd you do in the desert?
    489195|00000000||Sought oneness with nature. Magical place, really.
    489197|00000000||But, I missed civilization, so I'm back. Aim to plant roots in Novigrad, become a respected citizen. And who knows, someday maybe even a town councilor.
    489179|00000000||Long time no see, Dijkstra.
    489177|00000000||Don't believe I know your friends.
    489181|00000000||Not gonna introduce me to your friends?
    489183|00000000||Good thing Happen's not here. He'd tan the hide on my arse for being so rude.
    489185|00000000||Francis Bedlam you know, but then, who's not heard of this patron of the fine arts and supporter of entrepreneurs of limited initial means.
    489187|00000000||And the dwarf's Carlo Varese, known also as Cleaver. Carlo's in entertainment, mostly.
    487783|00000000||Good work, gents.
    487784|00000000||Terribly sorry for that incident. My security failed. I'll get to the bottom of who, why and how.
    489243|00000000||They were Whoreson's scum. That's the bottom of who and how right there.
    489245|00000000||Don't start that again. Especially not in front of our guest.
    489247|00000000||Who pranced in right before they attacked. Coincidence? Why do I doubt it?
    489248|00000000||Let's give him a chance to explain.
    557328|d1f0fb0d||Wyvern
    571747|00000000||Ah. Me poor noggin'.
    571749|00000000||A pint'd hit the spot, it would.
    571751|00000000||Mouth's dry as stockfish.
   1086261|00000000||Smith
   1063057|00000000||Maybe you'd care to go up top? See if you're still there?
   1008101|00000000||What…? Who dares disturb my divine being?!
   1008103|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Pleasure…
    562614|00000000||Huh, expected the Allgod to be corporeal in form… but never thought he'd be… corpulent. Fattened up nicely at those peasants' expense.
    562615|00000000||Expense? Expense?! Not a word 'bout the help I give in return - blessin's, absolutions, enlightened advice? Believe me, these folks need all of it! I'd watch over 'em still if they fulfilled their end. But lately they offer these pathetic scraps.
    562616|00000000||…That they steal from the mouths of their children. And to make matters worse, you cast a curse on them.
    562617|00000000||And I'll not lift it till they bring me worthy offerings! I'm to settle for curds and whey? Not a chance. And you can tell them that!
    562644|00000000||Been here long?
   1008287|00000000||Been in this hole long?
   1008289|00000000||For a century or so. One winter I found shelter here, built a fire so large the flames leapt through the crack, lit the bushes above. I coughed from the smoke… and suddenly heard a peasant. "A voice outta nowhere," he called, "A miracle!" Thus I became a god.
   1043218|00000000||Parasite, more like.
   1043219|00000000||Maybe so. But what're Freya and Melitele, then? Demandin' prayers and offerin's, givin' naught in return? I talk, at least.
    562649|00000000||Got an idea how to resolve this. I'll just kill you.
    562643|00000000||Got an idea. I'm gonna kill you.
    562645|00000000||Listen here, lardass. You're gonna be satisfied with what you get, or I'll feed you to the ravens.
   1008168|00000000||Ploughin' reformers… Fine, fine. I'll sup more modestly… but just till the end of the war! Not one day longer!
    562642|00000000||Settle for humble offerings - or die.
    562651|00000000||Fine, I'll tell 'em what you want… but they'll carry you outta here on pitchforks one day. You'll see.
   1008133|00000000||Fine. I'll tell them.
   1061169|00000000||So long.
   1061401|00000000||Who the hell are you?
   1061403|00000000||Who the hell are you supposed to be?
   1061405|00000000||The local peasant folk call me the Allgod.
   1061664|00000000||Can think of quite a few other, more fitting nicknames.
   1061666|00000000||Now you listen to me, witcher. Have you no other duties, missions? Swamp's dangerous, got its share of true terrors. Tend to them, I harm no one.
    562604|00000000||You think this a jest, mortal?! Whosoever looks upon my godliness… must die!
   1037812|00000000||I've armor to finish. We'll talk later.
    501347|00000000||Can't get involved.
    501387|00000000||Collective responsibility, is that it? Not terribly fond of that strain of justice… But don't worry… won't get involved.
    501389|00000000||Good of you. See, witchers are like dogs - useful so long as they do what they're trained for. But when they start biting the wrong hands, no one hesitates to break their necks.
   1033534|00000000||Lovely speech. Almost set my tail wagging… So long.
   1033536|00000000||See? Even the freaks scorn you, Remi. Take him!
   1033513|00000000||Beautiful speech. So long.
   1033512|00000000||Actually, think I might bite after all.
   1033532|00000000||Ooh, think I actually will bite… And it'll be the right hands.
   1033538|00000000||To me! At him!
    501385|00000000||Can't allow this.
    501386|00000000||No one's asking your mind, mutant.
   1033530|00000000||Still think you'll listen to me. Or to my sword.
    501346|00000000||Can't allow this.
    501344|00000000||Help me! They'll burn me! Burn me alive! I've done nothing!
    501345|00000000||Nothing? Nothing?! Who concocted those poisonous potions? Who helped the Lodge of Sorceresses, sending them reports via megascope? Who addled men's minds with magic, eh?! I know you, Remi. I know you and your crimes.
    501382|00000000||That was long past. It shan't happen again!
    501384|00000000||Oh, we'll make sure it don't. Shackle him. His cunt, too.
   1033509|00000000||Mummy!
    501273|00000000||I swear… you're worse than door-to-door peddlers.
    501340|00000000||Leave, witcher. Or I'll find some iron jewelry for you, too.
   1053363|00000000||I beg you, madame, please don't touch the merchandise.
   1053365|00000000||Then how can I know if it's is fresh?
   1053367|00000000||Use your eyes, my dear.
   1053369|00000000||Easier said then done.
   1053371|00000000||Not always. For instance, one look at you, madame, and I know you're a product that is well past its prime.
   1056331|00000000||No… Unlikely that he ventured out so far. We're going the wrong way!
   1008651|00000000||Lots of scratches… None look lethal, though. Body's dried out as if it was drained.
   1014524|00000000||I know him. It's Jorre the White of Kaer Trolde… He died far from home.
   1008649|00000000||Someone buried him. Not skillfully… But with great care.
   1006864|00000000||Now shoo! I await someone.
   1006858|00000000||Why you need all these flowers?
   1006859|00000000||Nosy, aren't you? Wait and see.
   1010704|00000000||Pollen on the leaves still. Someone picked the bloom… recently.
   1056335|00000000||Well? Prepared to help me find Ramund now?
   1056339|00000000||Sure. Let's go.
   1056336|00000000||Sure, let's go.
   1056341|00000000||Maybe later. Got more important matters on my mind.
   1056337|00000000||Maybe later.
   1006862|00000000||Take one. But no more! I've put a lot of work into making this cavern cozy.
   1006860|00000000||Pretty, don't you think? Bellflowers, violets, kingcups, pimpernels… I must pick some edelweiss.
   1008818|00000000||Footprints. Some fresh, others faded. All leading in the same direction.
   1008620|00000000||Flower… No petals…
   1056333|00000000||I'll not trail you all over Skellige. I shall return where the trail begins!
   1008622|00000000||There were flowers here as well. But they've been picked. Every last one.
   1008635|00000000||Hoof prints. But a biped's.
   1072022|00000000||What a grotesque creature.
   1004139|00000000||The Wild Hunt is a sign from the heavens!
   1004140|00000000||Fall to your knees and pray!
   1004141|00000000||Beg the gods for mercy!
   1004142|00000000||Repent! Ask penance! Ask punishment for your iniquitous deeds!
   1054595|00000000||When this is all over, I aim to open a whorehouse. In Vizima.
   1054597|00000000||A proper one, with shaggy rugs on the walls, foul smellin' candles everywhere… you want in?
   1054599|00000000||What kind o' contribution you lookin' for?
   1054601|00000000||Just manpower. Or womanpower, as the case may be.
    446690|00000000||Let's go to the tower.
    510795|00000000||How will we recognize him?
    510811|00000000||He's donned a panther mask. He knew you were due to come for him. Seemed rather excited, ironically.
    510817|00000000||I'm afraid he's not fully comprehended the danger he faces. As I said, he's not terribly bright.
   1000456|00000000||Don't worry about that. He'll fit right in with a good number of the other mages.
   1000463|00000000||Geralt!
    510820|00000000||Let's go find him.
   1000489|00000000||I shall await word from you.
    510770|00000000||How will we recognize him?
    510619|00000000||Is Albert ready to leave?
    510639|00000000||Is your son ready to go? We'll have to act quickly.
    510644|00000000||Yes, I've seen to everything. Where will you take him?
    510736|00000000||You're better off not knowing any details. He'll be safe, I promise.
    510759|00000000||But…
    510761|00000000||Please trust me. It's not the first time I've done this.
    510773|00000000||I know. Thank you.
    510588|00000000||Let's get Albert. Where is he?
    510592|00000000||Entertaining the guests. He has always been an outsized presence at my receptions. I preferred not to arouse any suspicions…
    510616|00000000||When can we take him away?
    510618|00000000||We shall have to wait until the guests have imbibed enough to notice only the goblet-laden trays. Don't fret, it won't be long.
    430334|00000000||Let's go get Albert.
    430336|00000000||Any sign of the hunters?
    430423|00000000||Any sign of the hunters recently?
    430425|00000000||Since they attacked my servant at the market - none. All has been quiet.
   1000423|00000000||But I bribed a man of the Temple Guard. He claims there's more and more talk of Albert in the ranks.
    510570|00000000||How did the guardsmen learn about your son's interests to begin with?
    510575|00000000||Ahh, unfortunately, I cannot be sure Albert himself was not the source, merely boasting about an experiment. He's careless that way.
    510579|00000000||Like his father - a kind man, but a dimwit. Devoured by an arachas, I don't know if you've heard.
    510582|00000000||Yyyeah… Must've traveled far and wide.
    510583|00000000||Hardly. He attempted to breed them. Perhaps I should be pleased Albert adopted alchemy as his hobby - a safe one, relatively speaking, until recently, that is.
    421534|00000000||Thank you for agreeing to help. My valet warned me you might come with a… friend.
    421536|00000000||I'd prefer as few as possible knew of Albert's flight, but if you trust this man…
    430328|00000000||Like no one else.
   1003793|00000000||I think we've met before.
   1003795|00000000||Oh, you're…! Indeed. Well, I feel reassured Albert will be in good hands.
    509865|00000000||Excuse me a moment.
   1000398|00000000||Miss…?
    509884|00000000||Yes, it's me. The trout buyer.
    509888|00000000||Hm? Oh, yes, of course. Please excuse the precautions, but… perhaps we can speak somewhere in private?
   1073788|00000000||I must have a cup of chamomile…
   1071150|00000000||Temeeeria!
   1071148|00000000||Well! Come on!
   1071146|00000000||Come here, whoresons!
   1065595|00000000||Defend your king! Defend Redania!
   1065593|00000000||Reinforcements! Summon reinforcements!
   1065591|00000000||The witcher! Kill the witcher first!
   1064833|00000000||Your Majesty! There are too many! You must hide, Sire! There!
   1020713|00000000||Defend the king! Kill the witcher!
   1053050|00000000||They say another corpse's turned up… no eyes in its head, no heart in its breast.
   1053052|00000000||What beast kills that way?
   1053054|00000000||Only man's capable o' that kind o' cruelty.
   1035502|00000000||Get to the point.
   1035512|00000000||Know what, Lambert? Think I'd rather hear the short version after all.
   1035492|00000000||Keep it short.
   1041461|00000000||I'd prefer something concise.
   1035723|00000000||Had a friend - Aiden. A witcher from the School of the Cat.
   1035725|00000000||What's this about? Tell me already.
   1035729|00000000||You were gonna explain why you murdered the supervisor.
   1036381|00000000||What now?
   1036384|00000000||What do you intend to do?
   1036385|00000000||I intend to get even with the bastards who did it. Karadin most of all.
   1036386|00000000||We have to talk to Vienne. Must've had enough to drink by now. Let's go.
   1036382|00000000||Sorry about your friend.
   1036383|00000000||Don't need your sympathy, just your help.
   1036380|00000000||Sorry about Aiden.
   1035513|00000000||Some time ago Aiden took on a contract to lift a curse. Off a duke's daughter.
   1035720|00000000||It was a political mess from the start. Then there was hatred for the School of the Cat to deal with.
   1035721|00000000||They worked hard to deserve that hate. Basically turned hired assassins.
   1035722|00000000||Aiden wasn't like that.
   1036376|00000000||Anyway, some of the duke's courtiers had designs. Weren't at all keen on the curse being lifted from the duke's first born.
   1036377|00000000||So a band of trained assassins ambushed Aiden, murdered him. Our dear supervisor was one of them.
   1036378|00000000||And Jad Karadin?
   1036379|00000000||The assassins' leader. And the one to deal the mortal blow.
   1035727|00000000||What happened to him?
   1035724|00000000||So what happened to him?
   1035504|00000000||Far as I remember, the Ogre was killed in the end.
   1035506|00000000||Yeah. After it gutted my employer, we really didn't have a choice. I cut a deal with Aiden. We joined forces, split the reward for killing the Ogre between us.
   1035508|00000000||After that, we worked together a lot. Hands down the best man I'd ever met. I mean, I like you, you know that. Still, no comparison.
   1035501|00000000||How'd it work out?
   1058261|00000000||Lemme hear the whole thing.
   1035494|00000000||Had a friend. Aiden was his name.
   1035496|00000000||You had a friend?
   1035498|00000000||Oh, hi-fuckin'-larious. I met him soon after I'd accepted a contract to lift the curse from the Ogre of Ellander.
   1035500|00000000||Aiden had been hired to kill it. He was a witcher from the School of the Cat.
   1035491|00000000||Wanna hear it all.
    584729|00000000||All right, high time you explained some things. Why'd you kill Lund? What's this all about?
   1035490|00000000||Want the short version or the long one?
    534288|00000000||Got anyone in mind?
   1043435|00000000||Got anyone specific in mind?
    534351|00000000||There's a mercenary, Sukrus, often drinks at the Sturgeon. He's an old pirate, a Skelliger. He used to work for me. Huge as an oak, wouldn't fear a dozen Cleavers.
    534352|00000000||Can't you talk to him yourself?
    539955|00000000||We parted… not on the best of terms. That is to say, he demanded a bonus and I--
    539956|00000000||Didn't pay him. Great. What now? Am I supposed to pay your dues?
    539957|00000000||I'm certain you'll find some way to agree. Geralt, please don't leave me this way.
   1043959|00000000||What? Where am I supposed to find you a bodyguard?
    534287|00000000||Where am I supposed to find you a bodyguard?
    534358|00000000||Forgive me, Geralt - that was a mistake. To parley with bandits, make deals…
    539959|00000000||Too late now. King of Beggars'll get you supplies and then what? You'll have to pay him.
    539960|00000000||What have I done...? Geralt, you must help me.
   1055778|00000000||No, I won't. I'm a witcher, not a bodyguard.
   1055780|00000000||Precisely! You must find me a bodyguard! Geralt, I beg you! They'll kill me!
    534272|00000000||Not what we agreed.
   1043145|00000000||I don't have time for this.
    539953|00000000||I'll be back.
    539954|00000000||Don't leave me here!
    534275|00000000||I'll be back.
    534273|00000000||I was supposed to get you protection.
    534353|00000000||I was supposed to find you protection.
    534354|00000000||And have you?
    534277|00000000||Remind me what's going on.
    534359|00000000||Uh, remind me what you wanted me to do?
    534360|00000000||I beg you! I cannot stand it here much longer! Find me protection! A Skellige pirate! Have you done that?
    534278|00000000||Not yet.
    534363|00000000||No, not yet.
    534364|00000000||Geralt, by all the gods, I compel you! Help me!
    534346|00000000||Hattori? You in there? Open up!
    534347|00000000||No chance. Leave me be.
   1043139|00000000||Don't be silly, let me in.
   1043141|00000000||No, never. I shall stay in here until Midinváerne.
    534348|00000000||Hattori. Still building barricades?
    534349|00000000||Still.
    391014|00000000||Something's not right. Going the wrong way.
   1004872|00000000||Where's Josef get all his food from, eh?
   1004873|00000000||Joined the baron's men. He's a big lad, tough. Don't fear others and eager to use his fists.
   1004874|00000000||*Spits* Serve the Bloody Baron? I'd rather starve to death!
   1004875|00000000||You're well on your way to achievin' that…
    478768|00000000||Madame Irina? Can we talk?
    478769|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! Dandelion's told us so much about you!
    480805|00000000||Is he with you?
    480801|00000000||No, but I hope to bring him back soon. Here to talk about Dudu.
    480802|00000000||Hm. Let's speak in my quarters, at the back of the theater. We'll be undisturbed there.
   1004984|00000000||"Patricia Vegelbud."
   1004986|00000000||Could be a message from the murderer.
   1004988|00000000||Do you know her?
   1004990|00000000||Yes. Even went to her estate once with…
   1005021|00000000||Gods… he knows no bounds. To attack Lady Vegelbud, heiress of such a prominent family.
   1004994|00000000||Where is she? Tell me!
   1004995|00000000||She resides in an estate beyond the city. North of Oxenfurt.
   1004997|00000000||Gotta find her. Now.
   1005019|00000000||I can't be certain what this means… But I fear Patricia could be in danger. Mortal danger.
   1004982|00000000||A message from the murderer. The name of his next victim.
   1004958|00000000||Let's start.
   1004960|00000000||Gladly. The wounds conform to the killer's modus operandi. The victim was bound and forced to drink formaldehyde.
   1004962|00000000||Next, the killer removed the eyes, placed burning coals in the sockets, then opened the rib cage and… What's this? A parchment? Made of human skin…
   1004954|00000000||Let's start the autopsy.
   1007183|00000000||Von Gratz told me about you.
   1007191|00000000||Von Gratz told me all about you.
   1007193|00000000||Ah. Doubtless you've heard how I had the noble leader of the student protesters thrown in prison… But did you hear the protests were far from peaceful? Or did he neglect to mention it?
   1013666|00000000||How old's von Gratz? Fifty? Sixty?
   1013668|00000000||Fifty-three, I believe. Why do you ask?
   1013670|00000000||You look a little young to have been his teacher.
   1013672|00000000||Not surprising. For years I've lived in the cold and dark, breathing the vapors of embalming fluids. In short, working with corpses extends one's life. Amusing, is it not?
   1013663|00000000||Look a little young to be von Gratz's teacher.
   1013674|00000000||Choosing the lesser evil can be hard at times. Happen to know a thing or two about that.
   1013676|00000000||In that respect, this work has its benefits. I couldn't possibly hurt anyone here if I tried.
   1013664|00000000||You chose the lesser evil - not easy.
   1004966|00000000||People were dying, witcher. Those who rejected liberty, equality and fraternity would be found in the gutter come morning… their throats slit from ear to ear, with surgical precision.
   1013661|00000000||Joachim had been my favorite student, but… alas, I had to do something. So I reported him. Then I left the university and found work in the morgue - where none care about my past.
   1004970|00000000||Whereas Joachim… oh, fate's ironies. Years later he was appointed head of the very ward I had founded.
   1007185|00000000||By the way… you and von Gratz don't exactly get along. Why is that?
   1007187|00000000||I had him sent to prison. You see, Joachim led the student protests in 1242. A senseless and brutal revolt.
   1004955|00000000||You and von Gratz don't get along. Why?
   1005659|00000000||Not fond of Nathaniel?
   1005661|00000000||Very few people are.
   1005665|00000000||He's cruel and capricious. He stormed in here once, grabbed a scalpel I was sterilizing over a burner. Sliced my back with it - to the bone. Because I had forgotten to lock the storeroom.
   1005667|00000000||Hard to be fond of someone like that, wouldn't you agree?
   1005657|00000000||You and Nathaniel don't get along?
   1004956|00000000||Who's the victim?
   1004972|00000000||Who's the victim this time?
   1004974|00000000||Joris Aquinus. A lecturer in theology at Oxenfurt Academy. Found this morning at his home… on a catafalque made of his books.
   1004976|00000000||Any titles in particular?
   1004978|00000000||It seems all the tomes dealt with the Eternal Fire. Treatises critical of the faith's doctrines.
   1004980|00000000||Yeah… a mortal sin in Novigrad.
   1004947|00000000||Geralt, right? I'm glad you're here. Held off on the autopsy till you arrived.
   1004949|00000000||Nice of you. Especially given you didn't seem pleased about my previous visit.
   1004951|00000000||Because you came unannounced and in unfortunate company. I also had Reverend Nathaniel to contend with.
   1004953|00000000||Our spiritual caretaker has left the city on some important matter. And I know who you are, what drives you… I'm more than happy to aid your investigation.
   1070300|00000000||Fortunately Nathaniel had few questions. Any more might have meant trouble… serious trouble.
   1070302|00000000||Geralt, I mean no offense… But I'm in the middle of something. I shall let you know as soon as I learn anything that could help you.
   1070304|00000000||What are you waiting for, Geralt?! The murderer could already be at the Vegelbud residence!
   1086647|766028d0||Prisoner of War
    539858|00000000||Greetings, Hattori. See Sukrus already found you. You two agree to something?
    539859|00000000||Yes, Geralt. I was forced to sell him a few axes at the wholesale price, but I was glad to do it. Thank you!
    595815|00000000||Geralt! I've yet to thank you for your help with Tinboy! I'd never dreamt I could get away with paying so little. I have something for you.
   1008490|00000000||Thanks. How're things with Sukrus?
   1032637|00000000||All is in order, I can pay him now.
    539903|00000000||About that warehouse…
    539904|00000000||Yes, have you changed your mind? Will you borrow some of van Hoorn's stock?
    539860|00000000||About the warehouse…
   1046077|00000000||Are you crazy?
    539875|00000000||Are you insane?
    539876|00000000||Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
    539865|00000000||See you, Hattori.
    539866|00000000||Till we meet again, Geralt.
    539864|00000000||Farewell.
    539862|00000000||You accept orders for swords, now?
   1003955|00000000||Finally accepting orders for swords again?
   1003956|00000000||Sadly, no. I lack certain crafting supplies.
   1003957|00000000||Lemme guess - Ernst van Hoorn's got a monopoly on them as well.
   1008495|00000000||Just so. He bought them cheap from sword makers abandoning the trade. Now he hoards them like a squirrel. But if you…? No, you'd never agree.
   1008497|00000000||Agree to what?
   1008499|00000000||I happen to know where van Hoorn keeps his hoard. It's more than he could possibly ever use. We could... borrow a little.
   1046075|00000000||Remind me - what was I supposed to do?
    539907|00000000||What'd you ask me to do again? Remind me.
    539908|00000000||Visit van Hoorn's warehouse, with Sukrus, and obtain some crafting supplies. They shall smell of ammonia.
    539910|00000000||Right. Fine.
    539897|00000000||What're you getting me into? Borrow? Don't you mean steal?
    539898|00000000||Stealing from a thief's no crime.
    539899|00000000||It isn't? So what is it? Poetic justice? How did I get sucked into this? And why?
    539900|00000000||It's simple! The best swords you've ever seen! Armor, trebuchets, catapults!
    543357|00000000||All right, all right… Assuming I agree, how do you see this?
   1018186|00000000||Van Hoorn has his warehouse at the docks. The materials I need are very heavy. You must ask Sukrus to take his boys. One more thing – the crates I need will smell of ammonia.
    539871|00000000||What're you getting me into?
   1046076|00000000||Working on it.
    539911|00000000||I'm working on it.
    539912|00000000||Good luck, Geralt.
   1038717|00000000||Greetings, Hattori.
   1038719|00000000||Greetings, Geralt!
    456941|00000000||Thank you… Let's go.
    456939|00000000||Help me!
    491739|00000000||Where will I find the King of Beggars?
    491742|00000000||All right, I'll give you some coin, but you gotta tell me where the Putrid Grove is.
    491743|00000000||I don't know that. Keep your coin, I don't know a thing. Move on. Begone.
    491740|00000000||Piss off.
    491744|00000000||Get out of my way.
    491745|00000000||What's a crown to a gentleman like you? Easy as spitting!
    491746|00000000||Piss off while I'm still willing to let you go.
    491741|00000000||Here.
    495545|00000000||Thank you, you gold-hearted man! Care to hear me tale o' woe?
    495547|00000000||Some other time. I'm in a hurry.
    491738|00000000||Here.
    510406|00000000||Sir, sir! Be merciful. Give us a crown, eh? Me mum's sick and if I don't feed her, well, she's like to die o' hunger!
    578576|00000000||Any chance you play gwent?
    578579|00000000||Oh, aye, it's a great passion. Wanna play?
    578594|00000000||I'm ready. Let's do this.
    578580|00000000||Yeah, let's play.
    578595|00000000||Definitely, once I find some time.
    578581|00000000||Some other time.
    578592|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
    578593|00000000||Always, anytime.
    578575|00000000||Heard you play gwent.
    578598|00000000||Bravo! A grand win - congratulations!
    578596|00000000||What can I say - a tailor-made victory. Better luck next time, witcher.
    578600|00000000||You'll not find any worthy opponents here in Skellige. Skills like that you oughta test in Velen.
   1042494|00000000||Play the baron, or that famous lad Haddy. Now those are opponents for you!
    390493|00000000||Show me the blood that is your blood. Show me the blood that is lost.
    390495|00000000||The blood summons me!
    390497|00000000||"Just a bit further, mum, hold on!" The blood leaves her face.
    390499|00000000||Thorny boughs snag her, stop her… I am a drop on a web.
    391064|00000000||"Will Voytek wait?" Dark blood carries the question downriver.
    413978|00000000||Why do you seek the child of Elder Blood?
    413980|00000000||Nigh is the Time of the White Frost and White Light, the Time of Madness and Disdain.
    413982|00000000||The world shall perish amidst ice and be reborn of Elder Blood, of a planted seed.
    413984|00000000||What can you possibly offer?
    420000|00000000||You all right?
    420002|00000000||Akh akh akh… Y-yes akh…
    420004|00000000||Is it over?
    384166|00000000||It's done. The pellar's seen what he was meant to see.
    387754|00000000||The first vision - explain it.
    391086|00000000||What did you see first?
    391088|00000000||The pellar saw the baron and Missus Anna. They quarreled, he did not wish for her to leave. He shook her, but the pellar sensed no anger in him…
    400452|00000000||He wounded her, and in the blood the pellar sensed love. A love sad and tormented.
    414808|00000000||What was the second vision of?
    391104|00000000||Didn't fully understand what the second vision was about.
    391106|00000000||Anna miscarried, blood everywhere. Suffering, the pellar felt it on her. She died her daughter's death.
    414810|00000000||You spoke a name during the third vision.
    391125|00000000||Third vision seems most important.
    391127|00000000||Hm, they were walking through the woods, both weak, but for different reasons. Yet both knew where they were agoing.
    391134|00000000||Not sure I heard you right, but you mention a Voytek?
    391136|00000000||Hope filled both their hearts at the thought of him.
    413986|00000000||Hm. And the prophecy at the end? Ithlinne's words, you quoted them, and then asked me a question.
    413988|00000000||Forgive the pellar, he knows not what you mean. Spirits, the spirits speak through the ritual, not he.
    387756|00000000||Voytek - where'll I find him?
    387824|00000000||This Voytek from your vision - know him?
    387826|00000000||Voytek… Voytek… Two Voyteks have we nearabouts.
    387830|00000000||In Blackbough lives one. In his hut, there he stays, has for years. Gophers, with gophers he lives, they say. And he can remember a time when in these lands dwelled only elves.
    387832|00000000||And the other? Somehow I doubt they went to a century-old rodent lover for help.
    387834|00000000||A fisherman. A family he has, lives in a secluded hut near the river's mouth.
    414837|00000000||You don't look like you can get home on your own. I'll walk you.
    414839|00000000||Thank you.
    414841|00000000||No. Thank you for your help. Let's go.
    414814|00000000||I'll walk you home.
    414812|00000000||I should go.
    414831|00000000||Time I was on my way. Thanks for your help.
    414833|00000000||Refuse? Why, the pellar could never have refused.
    474723|00000000||A man seeks to do good in life, but evil is unavoidable. The ones who encounter evil, why, they must be helped.
    414835|00000000||Fare thee well, and may the gods bless and keep you.
   1037077|00000000||Kelpie? Does he mean that sea monster?
   1034692|00000000||No. That's what Ciri named her mare. Horse could apparently gallop like a demon.
   1034693|00000000||Hm, good name for a horse. So, shall we look for it?
   1034691|00000000||{Zireael, ní forde sol'eséir ean.}[Swallow, the obvious route is not always the best.]
   1037138|00000000||{Aim'sille Kelpie. } [Find Kelpie.]
   1034695|00000000||{Zireael, ní forde sol'eséir ean.}[Swallow, the obvious route is not always the best.]
   1037071|00000000||{Aim'sille Kelpie. } [Find Kelpie.]
   1055159|3a721865||Tree's Heart
   1007382|00000000||Guess we don't have a choice. We have to get that parcel back.
   1043536|00000000||I trusted a woman once, long ago.
   1043538|00000000||I was willin' to give me right hand for her…
   1043540|00000000||*Hawks spits* What happened?
   1043542|00000000||I don't got me fuckin' right hand no more, that's what!
   1033328|00000000||Aaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
    366556|00000000||No evil can survive the Holy Fire! The Holy Fire enlightens, burns and cleanses!
    366558|00000000||Holy Fire! Enlighten, burn and cleanse!
    366561|00000000||Behold the flame of grace and mercy!
    366567|00000000||Special pyre for you, freak - nice, slow burning. You'll beg for mercy in all the voices known to you, like the others of your species.
   1033334|00000000||I've done no wrong! None! I wanted only to live like you! Help me, kind folk! Please! Akh akh akh akh…
   1033337|00000000||Akh akh akh… Aak! Akh aaaaaa akh!
    366570|00000000||Gods! Look! A doppler!
   1050657|00000000||Ye heard about them sick Black Ones bein' sent to Temeria?
   1050661|00000000||Word is the pox fell on whole villages near Vizima! Then they cut up the sick while they still breathed!
   1050663|00000000||Oh, the gods'll never let that pass, never.
   1054303|00000000||You've the street's respect, witcher!
   1044460|00000000||Hah! Be grateful I'm no bruxa or alp. Else you would be dead already.
   1044462|00000000||Well done. Actually is something of a bruxa in the way you fight.
   1045727|00000000||Perhaps I should have them call me that… the Black Bruxa? Black, because… you know… Nilfgaard.
   1044520|00000000||All right. What's next?
   1044522|00000000||We should return. Just… forgive me, Geralt, I know this might sound awkward, but would you mind turning around for a moment? My corset's shifted, it's pinching me terribly.
   1045736|00000000||I can understand a woman wanting to look pretty, but fighting in a corset? It slows you-- Rosa?
   1045738|00000000||Shit. She ran off. Anything happens to her, var Attre will kill me. Need to find her.
   1044479|00000000||What now?
   1044480|00000000||Why the interest in fencing?
   1044486|00000000||By the way… how'd you get interested in fencing?
   1044488|00000000||I was bored. I've no friends here. Papa keeps me on a short lead. It's banquet after banquet after banquet… I detest banquets.
   1045781|00000000||Mhm. Boring conversations, terrible food, and weak booze.
   1045783|00000000||Exactly! At least with a sword in hand I can have some fun. You know, blow off steam.
   1044446|00000000||Ow… Ow… Stop… I yield.
   1044448|00000000||You all right?
   1045725|00000000||Yes. The only thing you've really hurt is my pride.
   1044524|00000000||…
    591723|00000000||Think that's a… swallow.
   1018538|00000000||Oh!
   1018539|00000000||{Cáedmil. } [Greetings.]
   1018536|00000000||{Larenna luned. } [Daughter of the Gull.]
   1041308|00000000||Well then, let's go. Do you think following the swallows will suffice?
   1041936|00000000||We'll see.
   1002500|00000000||Message was definitely for Ciri. "Daughter of the gull" - Lara Dorren's heir.
   1002502|00000000||Indeed, it is what the elves would title Ciri. But what was the bit about the sign of her sword? A riddle?
   1002504|00000000||Yeah, not a hard one, though. Not if you know Ciri named her sword Zireael - Swallow.
   1002506|00000000||Come now, who aside from you would know that?
   1041547|00000000||Might've been the point. Your elven mage secured the passage, hid it, so that only Ciri could find it.
   1041295|00000000||He failed to foresee that someone like you would show up.
   1041297|00000000||Nevertheless, I think he was expecting uninvited guests, made some preparations. Let's hope the Wild Hunt ran into some obstacles.
   1002491|00000000||It was a message for Ciri.
   1002492|00000000||A what projection?
   1002511|00000000||A what projection?
   1002533|00000000||Something akin to a postbox for mages.
   1002564|00000000||Much safer than an ordinary letter, which anyone can intercept en route to its recipient.
   1002405|00000000||What was that? An illusion?
   1002456|00000000||No… A morphotic projection.
    591730|00000000||{Faeve'te, larenna luned. } [I await you, Daughter of the Gull.]
    591731|00000000||That's him! That's the elf!
    591732|00000000||{Arvegh t'va gláeddyv. } [Follow the sign of your sword.]
   1018508|00000000||Well, now I know what distorted my effort at teleportation. This very portal.
   1061192|00000000||And I know why I landed in that drowner nest.
   1061194|00000000||You should be pleased you emerged from the portal in one piece.
   1061899|00000000||And everyone still wonders why I hate to be teleported.
   1061190|00000000||We must try to activate it.
   1059814|00000000||It worked. Come.
   1061895|00000000||Sure it's safe?
   1059816|00000000||Of course. The elven mage prepared this passage for Ciri. Come on, now.
   1003479|00000000||Fuck him up, Sukrus!
   1003480|00000000||Floor the scag! Floor him with a hook!
   1003481|00000000||Tuirseach! Tuirseach!
   1003478|00000000||Smash the goatfucker's face!
    575751|00000000||Merchant was right… Actually does look like a giant cat.
    576689|00000000||Looks like the imp dropped some loot.
    575753|00000000||Jumped this wall? Nimble little beast.
    575756|00000000||Dropped down into the moat. Trail ends here.
    575759|00000000||Paw prints end here… boot prints start there.
    591650|00000000||Could it be the puss in boots?
    575762|00000000||Door's wide open… Interesting.
    575765|00000000||A woman's blouse, a man's shirt, a child's shoes… But only one bed.
    575779|00000000||Lavender… Strong scent. Enough to track him down.
    576283|00000000||A letter? Well, well. Our imp's at least literate, if not outright educated…
    576655|00000000||Ran away. Damn it.
    576706|00000000||Stop already!
   1018366|00000000||A doppler. Explains a lot… And complicates matters. Need a good lead to track him down.
    575750|00000000||Hey! Wait!
    498300|00000000||Burned some burdock in the stove. Godling couldn't stand the smell and fled. And Corinne simply… awoke. Anyway, house is clean.
    498301|00000000||Excellent! I must admit the experience has put me off the building - I shan't keep it. I'm mindful of the reward I owe you and you'll receive a sizeable commission. As soon as I'm… I'm able to sell the house.
    500472|00000000||Come by from time to time and ask. The de Jonkheers never break their word once given.
    498302|00000000||Thanks.
   1043868|00000000||I know why the house is haunted.
   1043870|00000000||Got a godling in your house. Name's Sarah and she's an ornery little thing. Left her alone but thought I should tell you about her.
   1043872|00000000||I thank you for being candid. Could you rid me of this beast?
   1043874|00000000||You can do it yourself. Just burn some burdock in the oven. She's sure to run, godlings detest the smoke.
   1043935|00000000||I will not wage war on a beast, large or small. Piss on the godling, piss on the house. I must merely find a fool willing to buy it.
    498298|00000000||A bit of both. A demon had captured Corinne. I managed to free her, but the house is still haunted.
    501454|00000000||Did Corinne dream of the building's past?
    501456|00000000||Yeah… Pretty horrid, apparently, though she refused to talk about it. Nobody should inhabit the place.
    498299|00000000||So many crowns, I paid… Ah, well… It shan't put me in the poorhouse.
   1043867|00000000||House is still haunted. Can't seem to lift the curse.
    498297|00000000||I saw Miss Corinne leave, but she refused to speak to me. Is the matter resolved? Or quite the opposite?
    498277|00000000||Well, witcher? What have you learned? More importantly, what have you resolved?
    498290|00000000||Something or someone's playing hide and seek with me in there. Left signs showing where to go, what to do. I'll try to figure out what's going on. And who it is.
    498280|00000000||Working on it.
    498291|00000000||The house isn't cursed, just has a tenant - a godling.
    500633|00000000||What the devil is a godling?
    500635|00000000||Post-Conjunction creature. Likes making mischief.
    501450|00000000||"Mischief," you call it, yet it's likely to prevent me from selling.
    501452|00000000||I can try to smoke it out. I'll need burdock.
    498281|00000000||I need some burdock.
    498278|00000000||How did you fare? Learn anything?
    500642|00000000||Your burdock. Will that do?
    500644|00000000||That's plenty, thanks.
    558603|00000000||What is this life? Well ye know…
    561823|00000000||Fleeting torment ere we go.
    561825|00000000||What comes next, once life subsides…
    561827|00000000||Man his own fate decides.
    561829|00000000||Soon will rise thy dead, thy buried…
    561831|00000000||Each will say by what they're harried.
    561833|00000000||Will ye grant these souls reprieve?
    561835|00000000||We're prepared to end their grief!
    558611|00000000||Let's begin Forefathers' Eve!
    447677|00000000||Dammit… That's a lot.
    447713|00000000||We've gotta go down there. No other way.
    447747|00000000||Rats fear fire, right?
    455639|00000000||Mhm. But Igni's not enough to--
    455641|00000000||Leave it to me.
    447675|00000000||Stop. Hear that? What is it?
    450766|00000000||Rats.
    450768|00000000||Oh, my speciality, remember? You've got nothing to fear.
    450770|00000000||Depends how many there are.
   1034914|00000000||Help! Murder!
   1034916|00000000||Like it spicy, eh? Fine, whoreson! Have it your way!
    466297|00000000||Bloody hell, bitch stabbed herself right in the gut. Dah, useless now. Ptooey!
    466299|00000000||Shoulda ploughin' tied her up. Next time think afore you drop yer drawers.
    499176|00000000||Argh… Search the huts.
    571740|00000000||Why the devil're you botherin' me?
    571742|00000000||All this ain't worth a dog's prick.
    571744|00000000||Devils take every man jack of you.
   1007937|00000000||Went to the forest for brushwood yesterday…
   1007939|00000000||Argh! D'you not hear the huntsman? That some fiend prowls the thickets…?
   1007941|00000000||What am I to heat me hut with? Cowpats?
   1007943|00000000||We've had none of those since they stole the cattle!
   1074570|00000000||Come with me.
    367787|00000000||Lemme shut the door. Wouldn't want her screams to bother you…
    422166|00000000||Like you to craft something for me. Think you can?
    422158|00000000||Want you craft something for me.
   1086500|00000000||Let's play cards.
    422164|00000000||So long.
    422160|00000000||Farewell.
    422156|00000000||Lemme see what you're peddling.
    422162|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    422154|00000000||Need something sharpened? Reforged?
   1086499|00000000||Let's play gwent. Show me your deck.
    422251|00000000||So long.
    422247|00000000||Farewell.
    422245|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422249|00000000||Show me what you got there.
    422243|00000000||Ooh, first customer of the day! Welcome!
    475143|00000000||Bolo, what the fuck you doing?
    475145|00000000||Move your arse, one of ye! Find out what the hell's goin' on in there!
    475155|00000000||Find 'im! I want 'is head on a pike!
    475246|00000000||Kill 'im!
    475094|00000000||You've got a young daughter, gramps. I know…
    475096|00000000||Search where ye will.
    475098|00000000||One o' these days, you'll not hide 'er in time. Hear me? And you'll watch every lad in the unit shag 'er senseless.
    475138|00000000||Strap on the loot! We're done 'ere!
    475141|00000000||Bolo?!
   1062752|00000000||Begone! Leave me be, whoever you is! Get away!
    371718|00000000||Take care.
    371732|00000000||Godspeed.
    351401|00000000||Wish I could help.
    371728|00000000||Ye can't. None can. This… this end's it all, everything…
    351393|00000000||I wish I could help.
    351391|00000000||It's over now.
    474728|00000000||Calm down. It's over.
    474730|00000000||Aye, it's over… All's past, never to be restored. I'll not forget that ever.
   1062225|00000000||What happened?
   1062227|00000000||I dunno… don't wanna know. They came for Hendrik… and they got 'im.
    487506|00000000||Weren't here long, the terrors. Yet the village froze like in the heart of winter…
    476099|00000000||You in that hut when they rode off?
    487508|00000000||No. And I'll not set foot there. Never.
    351423|00000000||Tell me what happened here. Step by step.
   1062034|00000000||They took 'em… Took 'em all…
    474726|00000000||Tell me what happened.
    351435|00000000||Farewell.
    351459|00000000||Farewell. And peace of mind to you.
    351461|00000000||Hm. Mh hm hm…
    473744|00000000||Looking for a man named Hendrik. Supposed to live in this village.
    473746|00000000||Aye, he did. No longer. They nabbed 'im in that hut. If you'd o' heard the cries, sir… if you'd o' heard how a man can scream… how he can suffer.
    351358|00000000||What happened here?
    411235|00000000||Hm, hm… black riders…
    351360|00000000||Death descended… I felt its icy breath.
    371730|00000000||He who's seen death gallop through shall know no peace…!
    361213|00000000||The sun was waning, see… and the dusk went crimson like blood. Thought to meself, "Strange. The toads - I cannot hear them."
    497255|00000000||I know not what happened there, save terror through and through. Hendrik screamed, then he begged. By the end he could do naught but moan…
   1075361|00000000||If you've not had your fill, you'll find worthy pugilists elsewhere. Plenty of 'em in Novigrad, plenty in the Skellige Isles.
    517108|00000000||What a fight! Let it be known by one and all that the witcher has defeated the sergeant and become champion of all Velen.
    517109|00000000||You saw it happen - sergeant remains champion of Velen.
    517110|00000000||And now, behold! We've a surprise this night! A foe so extraordinary the witcher'll need some luck!
    500390|00000000||Priscilla.
    500392|00000000||Phew, I'm relieved. Time is short, but she's written many an excellent scene, practically in her lap, just hours before we've opened.
    500394|00000000||What will the play be about?
    500396|00000000||Not sure yet, but we definitely have to mention dopplers.
    500398|00000000||Hm, that could be risky. But… We must think about getting the word out - about the new play - and arrange for some ushers to keep the peace. Will you tend to that?
   1074244|00000000||All right, got the cast figured out.
   1074256|00000000||It seems so. Prepared to plunge headlong into your career as a mummer?
   1074230|00000000||Got the cast figured out.
    367830|00000000||Not an actor. No talent.
    367836|00000000||I'm no actor. Might not have noticed, but I'm a little low on emotional expression.
    367838|00000000||But that's perfect. After all, you're to play the Witcher, not the Princess.
    367660|00000000||Besides, you must appear on stage, Dudu must see you. It's the crux of this entire endeavor.
    367824|00000000||You're right. Just never thought I'd have to do something like this…
    482220|00000000||You'll be fine, dear. You need only strut on stage, great sword in hand, furl your brow, make some threatening faces, then deliver a few lines in a gravelly voice. Think you can manage?
    367832|00000000||It's a good idea. Doubt I'll get a standing ovation, but Dudu'll see me. That's the key.
    491912|00000000||But… you will make an effort, won't you? Learn your lines, at least?
    491913|00000000||I'll give it a shot, of course.
    367828|00000000||Good idea.
    181773|00000000||Who's playing the Witcher?
    181775|00000000||An amateur - it'll be my first time working with him. But I'm confident he’ll pull it off.
    181750|00000000||Newcomer to the troupe?
    367783|00000000||In a sense... Oh, stop pretending you don't know. I'm talking about you.
    181676|00000000||Who's gonna play the Witcher?
    367842|00000000||You should play the Princess.
    367684|00000000||Role's yours. Talent and experience trump looks in my book.
    367686|00000000||I'm honored. I shall give it my all.
    367678|00000000||Let's have Priscilla do it. No offense, but most people…
    367826|00000000||…assign greater importance to appearance than to talent. I understand. I shall let her know... I'm certain she'll be wonderful.
    367840|00000000||Have Priscilla do it.
    360837|00000000||So, about the Princess - small part, but an important one. Any idea who could play her?
    367820|00000000||Priscilla would be the obvious choice - she's young and beautiful. Yet I do have more stage experience…
    360787|00000000||Let's talk about the Princess.
    393921|00000000||I prefer Maxim.
    393933|00000000||Let's risk it and give the role to Maxim.
    394002|00000000||He's had a good spell of late, so maybe he won't let us down.
    393929|00000000||Let's go with Abelard. I'll take a reliable artisan over an unpredictable artist any day.
    393931|00000000||Rightly so... The project is risky enough without our casting Maxim.
    393919|00000000||Let's go with Abelard.
    393911|00000000||So who do you see playing the Doppler-Prince?
    393913|00000000||I'm finding it hard to decide between two candidates. Abelard Rizza would be the safer bet. He's been part of the our troupe for ages, has flawless technique… but he doesn't exactly captivate the crowds.
    393915|00000000||Who's your other option?
    393917|00000000||Maxim Boliere. Outstanding actor and audiences love him, but sadly I can never be sure he'll show up sober. Or that he'll show up at all.
    393893|00000000||Let's talk about the Prince.
   1065866|00000000||See you later.
   1065868|00000000||Remember to study your lines. We've no prompter, so you must know them backwards and forwards.
   1065870|00000000||Right.
   1065360|00000000||See you.
    491414|00000000||Getting rich off this?
    491415|00000000||These performances bring in much coin?
    491418|00000000||Well, it varies. On good days the square is barely capable of accommodating everyone, other times we're lucky to earn a handful of coppers.
    491422|00000000||Of course, we shall pay you a fee as well. You're a member of the ensemble now.
    491796|00000000||Hm, thanks.
    370472|00000000||Wanted to talk about the text itself.
    370474|00000000||Hm, it's not at all badly written.
    416790|00000000||In fact, I quite like it! I was willing to relax my standards to help Dudu, but we may have something very interesting here.
    446186|00000000||I've very clear ideas who to cast as the Servant, the Witcher and the Queen. But I'm not certain who should play the Prince and the Princess…
   1065342|00000000||The text - need to discuss that.
    500372|00000000||How can I help you spread the word about the premiere?
    500374|00000000||Well, we'd like all the city to hear about it, so we must clearly talk to the Puffins.
    500376|00000000||Who're the Puffins?
    500378|00000000||Street artists. Get them to announce the premiere and even the mussels on the harbor piling will hear about it.
    500380|00000000||Where'll I find them?
    500382|00000000||They did occupy some rooms in the Bits, in a townhouse, but I can't be sure they're still there. I've not seen them in the streets lately. They may very well have hung up their body hose…
    500384|00000000||See if I can find them, and if they'll work for us.
    500355|00000000||How do I help you publicize the staging?
    181779|00000000||Oh, show me! Let me… peruse it quickly, then we can discuss the other matters. What of the ushers you were to hire…?
   1065848|00000000||Taken care of. They'll be here for the performance.
    368195|00000000||So, we can start as soon as I hire some ushers?
    368199|00000000||Just so. Let me know as soon as you've found someone for the job.
   1065331|00000000||Priscilla's done. I have her manuscript of the play.
    500356|00000000||Priscilla's done writing. I have her manuscript.
    526992|00000000||Thanks for helping. I'll come back once I've found some ushers.
    526994|00000000||See you then.
    500386|00000000||Thanks for your help. Be back with some ushers, and once Priscilla's done with the play.
    500388|00000000||See you then.
    500358|00000000||Thanks. See you.
    500353|00000000||Why the ushers?
    500360|00000000||Think we need ushers? A play about dopplers could be controversial… but are ushers absolutely necessary?
    500362|00000000||Can't be sure if you've attended many performances, but Novigrad crowds can be particularly… difficult.
    500364|00000000||Rotten apples, tomatoes, eggs - that sort of thing?
    500366|00000000||Axes, butchers' knives and bricks, actually.
    500368|00000000||All right… Know anyone appropriate?
    500370|00000000||Try the docks, perhaps. You're bound to find some men willing to do any work for a few crowns.
    500347|00000000||Priscilla, actually. She's done writing it. Tells the story of a witcher who rescues a doppler from certain death.
    500349|00000000||Hm, sounds interesting. I'll gladly have a glance, but first we must think about getting the word out and organizing some protection - ushers.
    500351|00000000||Would you mind tending to these matters?
    500343|00000000||I wanna stage a play. Something that'll really draw the crowds.
    500345|00000000||I see… And you hope it will get Dudu's attention as well, draw him here. So it must be an entirely new play? And… who will write it?
    500340|00000000||I'd like to put on a play.
    500341|00000000||Dandelion's in trouble.
    500400|00000000||Dandelion's in trouble.
    500402|00000000||That much I guessed - though I am curious how serious it is.
    500404|00000000||Did he seduce a powerful man's wife and go into hiding? Or did he write an offensive couplet about the priests of the Eternal Fire?
    500406|00000000||Worse. Lots. I'm gonna try to help him. Gotta contact Dudu first.
    500408|00000000||But he's disappeared as well.
    500410|00000000||Have a plan to lure him out of hiding, but I need your help. Can I count on you?
    500412|00000000||Naturally, but what can we possibly do…?
    500414|00000000||How can I help? We've not seen Dandelion or Dudu recently…
   1065695|00000000||Ah, there you are!
   1065775|00000000||Managed to hire some ushers.
   1065777|00000000||Wonderful. That's one matter resolved.
    446188|00000000||You any closer to being ready for this premiere?
    449744|00000000||Halberdier Number Two's in the props room crying. Apart from that, it's going splendidly.
    462325|00000000||And you? Are you ready?
    394008|00000000||All right, let's start. Wanna get this over with.
    394010|00000000||Everyone says so before their first time. Afterwards, it's impossible to drag them off the stage. You'll see, you'll love it.
    393998|00000000||We can start.
    446184|00000000||Need a bit longer…
    446190|00000000||I need a bit more time…
    446192|00000000||Fine, but we should start soon.
    368279|00000000||Working on it. Still need to learn my lines. It's a lot to memorize…
    394000|00000000||One who knows an entire bestiary by heart and can blend dozens of alchemical brews can surely memorize a few lines of rhymed verse. Good luck!
    368275|00000000||Still need to learn my lines.
    368277|00000000||We can start now.
    368281|00000000||We can start now. Looked over the script, out of curiosity… We can start any time, even now.
    368283|00000000||Well, we've no time to lose. Come to the stage.
    487050|00000000||Zoltan? What're you doing here?
    487054|00000000||Prissy told me you lot're puttin' on a play, with you playin' the lead…
    487056|00000000||I'm not the lead…
    487063|00000000||So I thought to meself, I'd sooner shave me beard than miss that! Tell me, witcher - you gonna wear hose and a codpiece?
    487071|00000000||Come, Geralt. You must focus your mind before you go on stage.
    487072|00000000||Good luck!
    500416|00000000||Madame Irina?
    500418|00000000||In the flesh. And you must be Geralt, the White Wolf! Dandelion's said so much about you!
    500420|00000000||Is he with you?
    500422|00000000||No, but I hope to bring him back soon. Here to talk about Dudu.
    176074|00000000||Vespula's got new protection.
    176086|00000000||Vespula's got someone else's protection now.
    176088|00000000||Really. Whose'd that be?
    176076|00000000||Get outta here.
    176090|00000000||Go. Now.
    176092|00000000||Now listen… You might have two swords, but there's four of us…
    501054|00000000||Yeah… Four men. Collecting tribute from one washerwoman. Don't think I have much to fear.
    416817|00000000||Best think again.
    184261|00000000||Mine. Offered her a better rate.
    184265|00000000||All right. So let's see if you're a good bargain, or just cheap shit.
    184171|00000000||Mine.
    184169|00000000||The King of Beggars'.
    184235|00000000||The King of Beggars'. Made a deal with Junior. This is his turf now.
    184237|00000000||Didn't hear nothin' about that.
    501078|00000000||But you have heard what Bedlam does to people who cross him? Or you need a demonstration?
    501091|00000000||C'mon, Fritz… Boss wants it that way, it's how it's gotta be.
    176080|00000000||Take this coin and leave.
    176082|00000000||That ain't how it works. Vespula's to pay… or be taught a lesson.
    184063|00000000||Already given her a verbal reprimand. Now go, before I teach you a lesson.
    501069|00000000||Come on… Gold's gold.
    176072|00000000||I'll pay what she owes.
    355377|00000000||I will get you every last copper - with interest. Gimme a week, please!
    355379|00000000||Whoreson's no banker. He's an honest man - you pay on time, you get protection. You don't pay…
    355381|00000000||Help!
    355383|00000000||What you hollerin' for, stupid wench! What you hopin' for, a knight in shinin' armor?
    500989|00000000||Close enough.
    501011|00000000||Keep outta this, grayhead. Not your concern.
    432568|00000000||The witcher'll burn you!
    432566|00000000||Swine!
    171782|ca8c590e||Ealdorman
   1076972|00000000||Well, I-I've no gold, I-I've naught, in fact. But ye ever come to Claywich, I'll have a bloody barmy reward for ye. You watch, wait and see!
    481188|00000000||Don't give up, girl!
    557206|00000000||Look, we've managed to cross the bridge. This is where we saw the Wild Hunt.
    557207|00000000||Great, means they're way ahead of us. Come on.
    571728|00000000||Don't go a-botherin' me.
    571730|00000000||She only ever feels like shaggin'! Don't lift a finger 'round the yard!
    571732|00000000||Life's a bitch.
    474568|00000000||Sorry. Unavoidable.
    474617|00000000||Forgive me. It couldn't be avoided. I truly am sorry.
    474619|00000000||Yeah, sure! Like hell, you're sorry!
    474621|00000000||Calm down. Go home. With a bit of luck I'll be back soon with news of your family.
    474566|00000000||Calm down.
    474605|00000000||Do anything stupid, and I'll kill you, too.
    474608|00000000||Go plough yourself! Kill me if you must. I've nothin' to live for anyway.
    474610|00000000||You've got another daughter… and a wife. And the botchling's blood will help me find them.
    474625|00000000||What… what will you do with that blood?
    474627|00000000||Me? Nothing. Just hope the pellar knows what to do with it. Go home. I'll come see you once I know something.
    474570|00000000||Shut up before you wake someone. Last thing we need is a crowd.
    474572|00000000||Fuck it! I don't ploughin' care, hear me?! You killed my child!
    474576|00000000||I killed a botchling. Your daughter died a while back.
    474603|00000000||Go home. Get yourself together. I'll try to find your other daughter - the one who's still alive.
    474564|00000000||Quiet down. Wanna draw a crowd?
    173496|00000000||Bloody hell! You killed my child!
    414941|00000000||You know I had to.
    474553|00000000||You were supposed to lift the curse! Save it, damn you! Not kill it!
   1043760|00000000||This way. Baron's in the garden.
    477340|00000000||Glad to join you.
    477345|00000000||Thanks. Be happy to join you.
    477348|00000000||What do they call you?
    477359|00000000||Name's not important.
    477393|00000000||I'm no one special. Fellow traveler, that's all.
    477698|00000000||Fine thing, that, sittin' down with folk and not introducin' yourself. Maybe you have something to hide?
    477699|00000000||Not this again. If he doesn't want to, then he needn't talk.
    477700|00000000||Indeed, it's rather suspicious…
    477701|00000000||Mighty suspicious. Best introduce yourself, mate - we don't like spies.
    477704|00000000||Hah! Told you - a spy.
    477705|00000000||Damn, maybe he is.
    477706|00000000||I'll not let a spy walk free! To arms, gentlemen!
    477707|00000000||Shit.
    477709|00000000||Don't wanna cause any trouble. Farewell to you.
    477703|00000000||Think I should go.
    477702|00000000||Geralt. I'm a witcher.
    477598|00000000||Such a shame Henselt perished in Lormark. Blasted Dragonslayer.
    477657|00000000||Leave him alone.
    477661|00000000||A Nilfgaardian spy in league with Foltest's murderer?
    504371|00000000||I'll take you both on.
    477651|00000000||Hands off the merchant.
   1069922|00000000||All right, I'll grab him.
   1069924|00000000||Most you'll grab is your own cock!
   1068235|00000000||Fine. I'll hold him.
   1069927|00000000||Sorry, not about to get involved.
   1069929|00000000||I'll fuckin' manage on my own!
   1068236|00000000||Rather stay out of this.
    477658|00000000||Relax. A misunderstanding, that's all this is.
    504376|00000000||Hold him, witcher. I'll find a rope.
    477660|00000000||Hah! Not a chance!
    477652|00000000||Calm down, both of you.
    477649|00000000||You know a lot for an ordinary merchant.
    477650|00000000||I do. What of it? Hm?
    504357|00000000||Just that it makes me like you even less. First you ask about the message I'm carryin'. Now you say you're waitin' for Nilfgaard to cross the Pontar.
    504360|00000000||You'd better come with me. I know some people who'd want to talk to you.
    504363|00000000||You'll have to kill me first.
    504365|00000000||If needs must.
    477691|00000000||Right you are. With Henselt alive, Nilfgaard wouldn't 'ave had it so easy in the east.
    504386|00000000||The emperor's sure to take Novigrad soon. He'll seize the Temple vault, the city armada. The west'll be all but his as well.
    477655|00000000||Shame Henselt perished in the battle for Lormark. Now there was a king! He'd have rebuffed the Black Ones.
    477596|00000000||Any news? Of the war, for instance?
    477597|00000000||They say the Black Ones'll mount a new offensive soon, to cross the Pontar. I bet diamonds to peanuts Radovid won't manage to repel this time.
    477594|00000000||What's new in the world these days?
    477656|00000000||Time I was on my way. Thanks for your hospitality.
    477670|00000000||Stay a while. Road's no hare, it won't run off.
    477671|00000000||If he's in a rush, let him go.
    503854|00000000||Take care, master witcher.
    477595|00000000||About time I left.
    477589|00000000||Exactly. Hm - Geralt… Heard that name before. You frequent the fairs?
    503526|00000000||Nope.
    477590|00000000||You've confused him with Gerard, the stage artist who, indeed, attends fairs and breaks wind to the tune of popular melodies. To the delight of the crowds, I'd add. Our guest is none other than the White Wolf himself.
    477591|00000000||Well, my apologies. Ain't you the one that… you know, the rumors about Foltest's death…
    477592|00000000||No. Wasn't me.
    477593|00000000||Oh.
    477392|00000000||I'm Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher.
    503523|00000000||They call me Rufus, and this here learned fellow is Theophile Maria Rosco, and this is… sorry…
    503525|00000000||Manfred. I'm Manfred.
    477358|00000000||Geralt.
    477349|00000000||Kind of you to let me join you. And it just so happens I've got something to warm us up.
    477350|00000000||Well! The kind of guest I like! I shall find some mugs.
    477351|00000000||Day full of surprises, truly.
    477352|00000000||You saved us - we'd just drained our last bottle. What do they call you?
    477344|00000000||Turns out I have something to drink.
    477360|00000000||Love to sit down, but got a long road ahead.
    477361|00000000||War and death all around. You might take time to enjoy life a bit, seize the moment.
    477362|00000000||It's no wonder we're losing this war. Behold - a paragon of the Northern army seizing moments instead of fighting the Black Ones.
    477386|00000000||I'll leave you to it. Cheers.
    503238|00000000||Good luck to you on your travels.
    477341|00000000||Some other time.
    477313|00000000||Greetings.
    477314|00000000||What is it? Hm?
    477338|00000000||Don't mind him. Sit with us.
    477339|00000000||You're most welcome to. Though be warned - we're in the middle of some serious studyin', as our learned companion calls it.
    532375|e6cc8bad||Peasant
    482580|00000000||Way to the next room's blocked….
    432913|00000000||Don't see any proof this man sold anyone fisstech, let alone contaminated powder. Can't let you kill him.
    432915|00000000||Then you, too, shall die, vatt'ghern. Shame you happened on our path… and chose to stand in our way.
    432889|00000000||Got no proof he sold any fisstech. Let alone contaminated powder.
    432921|00000000||Just the sale of fisstech is bad enough. But offering contaminated powder - it's malicious, something that has to carry punishment.
    432923|00000000||No! Don't let them murder me, you can't!
    443340|00000000||Thank you, vatt'ghern - for letting us do what was only right. Va fail.
    432891|00000000||Do what you want with him.
   1056132|00000000||Need to check if he's carrying fisstech.
    432909|00000000||Need to see if this man's actually carrying any fisstech.
    432911|00000000||We've done that already, checked everywhere, even his boots. Nothing! The bastard sold it all, which hardly makes him innocent.
    432893|00000000||What's this about?
    432895|00000000||This dh'oine sold fisstech to some young elves. A contaminated batch that killed every other user.
    432897|00000000||Lies! They mean to kill me, steal my gold! Help me! Please!
   1053656|00000000||What you sold was poison! Shame you weren't there to see the young lad and others expire amidst spasms.
   1060184|00000000||You, all of you to an… elf, you despise humans, seek vengeance on us! But can you fault us, fault me for your civilization's downfall?!
   1060186|00000000||Shut your mouth, poisoner.
    590894|00000000||Damn you!
    590895|00000000||There's rabid dogs here! They'll eat me alive!
    594345|00000000||Have mercy!
    590893|00000000||Whoresons!
    525510|00000000||[Don't react.]
    525577|00000000||Didn't like that guy.
    525610|00000000||Didn't like that guy. Why'd you insist on talking to him?
    525579|00000000||He's an old friend. His name's Moritz Diefenthel. Tell you the story later.
    525603|00000000||Who was that?
    525576|00000000||Who was that?
    525518|00000000||Join you? And just who would I join?
    525519|00000000||Your friends, among others. Once we've all gathered, I'll lead you--
    525531|00000000||You will lead? Forgive me, Merigold, but that is like allowing myself to be led by a lame duck.
    525533|00000000||Farewell.
    525590|00000000||Triss! Not what we're here for.
   1000992|00000000||No, it's exactly why we're here.
   1000994|00000000||Well, Moritz?
    525492|00000000||Triss! Not what we're here for.
    525489|00000000||Moritz? What're you doing here?
    525491|00000000||Little Miss Merigold, well, well. And I was led to believe this would be an elegant affair.
   1000989|00000000||Yes, I missed you, too.
   1000991|00000000||But can we put that aside for now? Do you have a way out of Novigrad? You can join us if you want..
    586915|00000000||I wish you a cold farewell.
    511059|00000000||By order of the hierarch: whosoever conceals a mage in their home shall burn alongside him or her!
    511058|00000000||Last chance to surrender unorthodox books! Grimoires and tracts blasphemin' the Sacred Flame, especially!
   1064837|00000000||Well? What? Is it done?
   1064839|00000000||It's done. Though all did not go according to plan.
   1064841|00000000||More on that later… First, a stiff drink. And a toast.
   1064844|00000000||The North! Temeria!
   1064846|00000000||Temeria!
   1064850|00000000||Not too early to celebrate?
   1064862|00000000||Sure this isn't premature? Radovid's dead, but it's a long way from that to a free Temeria. War's not over, not even close.
   1064865|00000000||You're mistaken.
   1064883|00000000||Roche… You? And Nilfgaard?
   1064890|00000000||Roche… You? In league with Nilfgaard?
   1064892|00000000||I'm prepared to do anything for Temeria. Even whore myself out.
   1064884|00000000||You're gonna get bilked. Emhyr'll get his way.
   1064894|00000000||You don't know Emhyr. He'll outwit you. Take your toys as if you were children.
   1064896|00000000||Oh, don't you fret. We've heads on our shoulders, eyes all around. Take Dijkstra, for instance…
   1064904|00000000||What's that?
   1064922|00000000||Can't let you kill them, Dijkstra.
   1064924|00000000||Aww, hard luck. Then you'll die with them.
   1064926|00000000||Kill them all.
   1064389|00000000||Won't let you kill them.
   1064928|00000000||It's not my concern, so I should let you do what you will… But you're a real son of a bitch, you know that?
   1064930|00000000||It's why I'll make an excellent chancellor.
   1064932|00000000||Farewell, White Wolf.
   1064390|00000000||Do what you will.
   1064906|00000000||Vakmeth, act one, scene seven. Always wanted to play that… never cast as anything but a halberdier.
   1064908|00000000||Geralt, what Thaler told you - put it out of your mind. There will be no truce with Nilfgaard. Redania, under my enlightened rule, will fight on until it wins. And when it does it will unite all the North. Including Temeria.
   1064910|00000000||Wha… How? This is not what we ploughin' agreed!
   1064912|00000000||True. Instead, we insisted on one realm's questionable sovereignty. And to recover it, we gave Emhyr virtually all the north's other kingdoms. It was not a wise arrangement. So, no deal.
   1064914|00000000||You two-faced whoreson… I will not allow this.
   1064916|00000000||Actually, you, Roche, should be the first to understand I've no choice.
   1075865|00000000||Why the hell would I understand?
   1075867|00000000||Because you too are a patriot.
   1064920|00000000||Geralt - this doesn't concern you. You may go… Fare thee well on your Path or whatnot.
   1070676|00000000||Meaning?
   1064900|00000000||If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.
   1064902|00000000||That but this blow might be the be-all and end-all here.
   1064886|00000000||Haven't told me the whole truth.
   1064888|00000000||You're right on that account… We know you're bloody allergic to politics, decided to emphasize mages and whatnot…
   1064882|00000000||I want the whole truth.
   1064870|00000000||Tomorrow at noon, the commander of Army Group "Center" will sign a truce in Emhyr's name… A truce whose wordin' we agreed with Dijkstra.
   1064872|00000000||So back there in Velen, when the trolls nabbed you…
   1064874|00000000||Yes, I was returnin' from the last round of talks. Emhyr will keep Aedirn and Lyria… But in exchange for Radovid's head and a stop to guerilla activities, he will withdraw from Temeria--
   1064876|00000000||Which will become the empire's vassal state.
   1067258|00000000||Self-ruled, internally! With its own courts, administrative structures and army!
   1064879|00000000||The Silver Lilies will bloom 'neath the rays of the Great Sun. So I'd say were I a poet.
   1064881|00000000||But I'm not, so all I'll say is there was no other fuckin' way.
   1064852|00000000||Temeria!
   1064855|00000000||Ugh… What now, Roche? A new guerilla campaign against the Black Ones?
   1064857|00000000||No. The war just ended.
   1064859|00000000||How's that? There something I don't know about?
   1064868|00000000||I'd say so. You see…
   1064849|00000000||Temeria!
   1064848|00000000||Bloody Temeria!
   1071154|00000000||Fight, you dimwits!
   1071152|00000000||Kill the witcher!
   1071158|00000000||Support! Run, get reinforcements!
   1071156|00000000||Fuck! Gotta do everything myself!
    422372|00000000||Do you wish the Eternal Fire's blessing upon you and your household? Come, true believer, may its light shine…
    422374|00000000||Watch it, or you'll see the shine of my sword. And back off, that incense is making me nauseous.
    422376|00000000||You might've said so right away. Countersign: "And fish soup gives the deacon's auntie a headache." What do you need? Before you ask - I'm all out of hemorrhoid cream.
    422378|00000000||What're you talking about? Your incense that bad for the brain…?
    422380|00000000||What do you mean? You gave the password, signaling you wish to buy some herbs…
    422386|00000000||Don't know any password. And if I said it by accident, then you folk run a shoddy conspiracy. "That incense is making me nauseous" - brilliant…
    422388|00000000||Argh, hope barnacles break out on your cock, you son of a leprous whore! Hope it grows wings and flies off to warmer climes come Yule!
    433869|00000000||If you report me, you motherplougher, I'll make sure our pyres stand side by side. That way I can blow on yours, see your arse roast before I go.
    422390|00000000||Curse a lot better than you bless. Actually starting to like you, herbalist. Relax, won't turn you in.
    422392|00000000||In that case, perhaps we can trade? I've many interesting substances…
    422384|00000000||I don't know any password.
    422382|00000000||This subterfuge - what's it about?
    422394|00000000||You're about as much a priest of the Eternal Fire as I am a vestal virgin. What sort of conspiracy is this?
    422396|00000000||Conspiracy - bah! Folk see conspiracies everywhere! I sell harmless things. Yet in turbulent times like these…
    422398|00000000||Think it's safer to don priest's robes? See, thing is, in this town impersonating a priest is likely grounds for punishment - cruel and unusual, I'd wager.
    422400|00000000||I impersonate no one! I am a priest! Though I'm also an alchemist. Sadly, it's become difficult to reconcile the two.
    434081|00000000||Hm - will you report me? Or shall we make a deal?
    434077|00000000||Trying to bribe me? Save your coin - I'm not fond of priests. In fact, you'd have to pay me to talk to them.
    434087|00000000||Then I shall sell you my wares for less. Cast your eyes, see if there's ought you could use. Provided, of course, you do not seek hemorrhoid cream.
   1086503|00000000||Wouldn't mind a game of cards.
    422462|00000000||Take care.
    434093|00000000||Farewell.
    434091|00000000||Show me your goods.
    422460|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    422458|00000000||You again? I've changed the code word, but you're still entitled to a hefty discount.
    460176|00000000||This is dull… I wish to go chat with someone.
    460178|00000000||Then go.
    509791|00000000||Alone? But that's so dull.
    509793|00000000||Then stay.
    460172|00000000||So, how goes it? Who's winning?
    460174|00000000||No one as yet.
    509789|00000000||Then I shall return later.
    592150|00000000||Thank you. And… take care. It gets easier.
    592147|00000000||Thanks.
    592152|00000000||Keep it. News I brought you isn't worth your coin.
    592154|00000000||Thank you, witcher. You're an honest man.
    592148|00000000||Can't take this.
    592113|00000000||Sorry to have to tell you - your wife's dead. Went too deep into the woods, wild animals got her.
    592139|00000000||Folk said that's what happened, but… I dared to hope.
    592141|00000000||I'm sorry.
    592143|00000000||I thank you anyway… Least… now I know her fate.
    592145|00000000||Your pay.
    469042|00000000||Looking for a hunter named Niellen.
    469044|00000000||Found him. What do you want?
    591923|00000000||Farewell.
    551393|00000000||Farewell.
    591974|00000000||I'll look in the woods, you might've missed something.
    592029|00000000||Ask around, too. She have any friends?
    592031|00000000||Hanna kept - keeps - to herself mostly. Watches the blacksmith's young 'uns atimes. And in the village, Glenna, the butcher's wife - she likes her best.
    592033|00000000||Thanks. I'll try to find her… but no promises.
    591971|00000000||I'll go look for her.
    591972|00000000||Farewell.
    592035|00000000||You have my sympathies. Farewell.
    469048|00000000||Farewell.
    472264|00000000||Your wife missing?
    472270|00000000||Here about your notice. I'm a witcher. When'd you last see your wife?
    591920|00000000||Five days past, 'fore dawn. Were on my way out to hunt, she were asleep. I come back, found no sign of her…
   1002189|00000000||Noticed anything strange?
   1002191|00000000||Notice anything strange? Maybe her behavior?
   1002208|00000000||No, she were her happy, smilin' self. Nothin' different of late… She's not run off, if that's what you're askin'.
    591921|00000000||Looked for her?
    591961|00000000||Maybe she went to the neighboring village, forgot to tell you?
    591964|00000000||No, my sister were never gone this long before.
    591966|00000000||Tried looking for her?
    591968|00000000||Asked round the village, none saw 'er go. She must've left when they were still sleepin'…
   1002188|00000000||Told her time and again not to wander off on her own. She never listened.
    591970|00000000||I mustered some men folk to scour the woods. Nothin'.
    585552|00000000||Me again. Here about your wife…
   1054299|00000000||Psst, witcher. I know who burnt the hunters' quarters down…
   1054301|00000000||Don't worry, though. I don't like them goat ploughers, either.
    397220|00000000||Should look around.
    423608|d3f91a2c||Armorer
    408533|00000000||Listen, it's like this: either give me the papers, or I'll take 'em from you.
    408535|00000000||Think I frighten that easy?!
    408517|00000000||Gimme the papers. Now.
    408525|00000000||Played cards for them once. Care to play again?
    408527|00000000||Hm.
    408529|00000000||You're clearly in the middle of a lucky streak. Could very well continue.
    408531|00000000||You might be right. Let's play.
    408519|00000000||I'll play you for them.
    475737|00000000||I win.
    408549|00000000||I ain't blind. Take the damn things. Let none say I ain't an honest man.
    408551|00000000||Gods know I'll only ever say kind things about you.
    475741|00000000||Give me the papers. You have to.
    408814|00000000||True. Definite.
    408812|00000000||Give me the documents - you have to.
    408541|00000000||I'll be back.
    408523|00000000||Farewell.
    408521|00000000||How much do you want?
    408537|00000000||How much're they worth to you?
    408539|00000000||I don't read, meself, but I seen the seals. I know it ain't no scrap of arsewipe. I won't sell 'em to the first fella comes askin'.
    408509|00000000||Hand over the documents, thief.
    408511|00000000||Me? A thief? I won 'em straight, I did, in a game of cards!
    467389|00000000||Not how Muggs sees it. Claims he was… mugged.
    467391|00000000||He lost, demanded them papers back, and when I refused he walloped me over the noggin with a bottle. Barely escaped with me life.
    475739|00000000||You win.
    408553|00000000||Sure did - hahahaha! Still got the touch!
    408543|00000000||Hm?
    408545|00000000||I win.
    408547|00000000||Shit, I lost.
    582609|00000000||A superb match - I thank you. Sadly, the grand prix we shall have to donate to some worthy cause.
    582606|00000000||Superb match, a great pleasure! The prize will be yours.
    582926|00000000||Thief! The coin's gone! The guard's been stabbed!
   1014945|00000000||What?!
    582927|00000000||How is this possible?
    582928|00000000||No one's removed the coin from the premises. All those leaving were searched.
   1017789|00000000||Achoo!
    582931|00000000||We must scour the building. Anyone leaving must pass inspection.
   1015307|00000000||Congratulations, Madame. A superb match! Did you expect to be victorious, my lady?
   1015309|00000000||Yes, I had a good feeling about the tournament.
    433982|00000000||Shoulda left you there, tied up, right at the water's edge.
    433984|00000000||Well, you can't turn back time… But I'm willin' to see to it your conscience don't torment you long.
    467694|00000000||Get him!
    433968|00000000||Should've left you back there on the bank…
    433986|00000000||Coin doesn't stink. Give it here.
    467705|00000000||There y'are. May it multiply in your purse! Now go.
    433970|00000000||I'll take the coin.
    433972|00000000||Witcher! John Verdun, remember? You saved me from the drowners!
    467650|00000000||Was copperless then… Now, why, me purse's burstin'!
    433978|00000000||Mhm. With coin that belonged to the refugees. Vengeance taste sweet?
    467652|00000000||I thought you'd come for your reward. I'll gladly pay, mind you. You saved me life - no two ways about it.
    544773|00000000||But if you're lookin' for a bruisin'… well, you'll find it.
   1039236|00000000||It's you!
    332833|00000000||Few prints… Murderer killed Fabian somewhere else, then carried him here.
    453608|00000000||Arranged the body and set the statues alight. This was a spectacle.
    326013|00000000||Blood stains.
    450136|00000000||That's where Fabian lay when they found 'im.
    450357|00000000||Furniture got knocked over. This looks like it was kicked.
    326020|00000000||Formaldehyde. Doubt Fabian used it…
    450301|00000000||More blood stains. But not near enough to say he bled to death. Unless…
   1072192|00000000||Somebody got rid of the blood, left a few stains behind.
    572436|00000000||Eyes. Humanoid… completely rotten.
    450144|00000000||Something's missing… Can I look in the workshop?
    450146|00000000||If needs must… Wait a spell. I'll open it for you.
    457902|00000000||Statues of the old gods. Nothing but women… shapely ones.
    450182|00000000||I'll get it open for you… Just don't know where I put the damned key.
    450564|00000000||So? Find anythin' of interest?
    578126|00000000||Murderer dragged something heavy… Statues. Or a corpse.
   1005643|00000000||Embers. Murderer leaves them in the eye sockets.
   1055869|00000000||How the hell'd ye do that?!
   1072300|00000000||Folk spoke true! No sign o' the pirates!
    396707|00000000||Beautiful game, ahem.
    455891|00000000||Congratulations.
    455893|00000000||I thank you. Naturally, you're entitled to a rematch.
    424835|00000000||I was knighted once.
    455869|00000000||Actually, I was knighted.
    455871|00000000||Ahem. Indeed? Not to pry, good sir, but who bestowed the accolade?
    440298|00000000||Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia. During the Second War.
    455873|00000000||Skirmish broke out on a bridge. Happened to be there with friends. We drove the Nilfgaardians back, then Queen Meve told me to kneel, recite an oath.
    440300|00000000||The Battle for the Bridge? Oh yes, heard of that. Ahem. Consider my objections withdrawn, sir.
    440294|00000000||Don't have a choice. I gotta meet Whoreson Junior.
    455885|00000000||Ah well.
    440296|00000000||Gentlemen! This man is asking after the owner. Adamantly so.
    440288|00000000||Gotta find the owner.
    440286|00000000||Thanks for the warning.
    440290|00000000||Forget I said anything.
    440292|00000000||Ah, a reasonable man. And reason is man's most important virtue. Where would be today were it not for reason?
    551132|00000000||Nowhere.
    455877|00000000||Ahem, verily! Nice chat, dear chap. Now what about a game?
    396697|00000000||Wanna play?
    396699|00000000||Naturally. Good luck to you!
    396693|00000000||Let's play.
    455867|00000000||Farewell.
    455879|00000000||Leave you to it, then.
    455881|00000000||Ehem, yes, see you.
    396701|00000000||Not in the mood for cards. Maybe later.
    398208|00000000||I shan't force you, but should you change your mind, I shall be waiting. Ahem.
    396695|00000000||Changed my mind.
    407638|00000000||Mind if I join you?
    396691|00000000||No, ahem, take a seat.
    424825|00000000||Cards being kind today?
    424827|00000000||Matters little. I don't play plebs.
    424833|00000000||Looking for the owner.
    424853|00000000||Nice place, isn't it?
    427460|00000000||Indeed. More the pity so much rabble comes here. Ahem. Sign of the times, perhaps - coin makes the world go 'round.
    427462|00000000||Owner must've invested a lot.
    427464|00000000||He's no miser, although… he might've banned fisstech. It attracts the lowest sort. Ahem. I asked him once if it was absolutely necessary, he just laughed.
    440282|00000000||Maybe I could have a word with him?
    440284|00000000||A word of advice, my friend. Never, ever ask after Junior.
    455883|00000000||Even let you in on a secret: I've been asked to inform whomsoever it concerns the moment anyone started asking after the owner. Be too insistent, and that's exactly what I'll do.
    396705|00000000||Ahem. Congratulations on your victory.
    398210|00000000||Thanks.
    414218|00000000||Well… I've the distinct impression my fortune's shrunk a bit.
    582260|00000000||The mutant cheated! I'll gouge those devilish eyes out with my bare hands!
   1052645|00000000||Shall we meet at the bathhouse as always?
   1052647|00000000||Oh no, that's a terrible idea.
   1052649|00000000||Why's that?
   1052651|00000000||The Big Four meet there now. You have heard of the Big Four, haven't you?
   1052653|00000000||Everyone has. If this is true, we must henceforth give the bathhouse a wide berth always.
   1005855|00000000||Whaddaya want? Eh?
   1005853|00000000||Bah, I've seen better.
   1005851|00000000||How are you?
   1005847|00000000||Argh… Hmpf... Mmf… Hm.
   1052160|00000000||Why don't they play the one about "the fresher who caught his arm in a thresher"?
   1052162|00000000||They can't sing that anymore. Contains heresies.
   1052164|00000000||Heresies? How's that? I don't remember anything…
   1052166|00000000||"Bleeding out his heart-blood's warmth, 'Fire, save me!' the student cried. Thrusting his stump into the hearth, he found heat, but still died."
   1052168|00000000||But that's for laughs… Frock-wearing idiots. Not an ounce of humor in them!
    440048|00000000||Guardsmen outside Triss' house. Not good.
    466065|00000000||Deal.
    466067|00000000||Take this and get out of my sight.
    465964|00000000||Agreed.
    466069|00000000||You can hire me. But you sure as hell can't buy me.
    466071|00000000||Ah, an impasse. Well then, it will be cheapest to kill you.
    467932|00000000||Three on one. Surely we'll manage - witcher or not! Take him!
    465966|00000000||I don't take bribes.
    466049|00000000||So, took care of the graves. Interesting, actually. One of the corpses proved to be quite, well, alive. And pretty talkative.
    466051|00000000||What do you mean?
    466053|00000000||Fisstech dealer, one of 'em survived. Had an awfully interesting story to tell.
    466055|00000000||Hmmm… Intriguing. I would purchase this story from you. For all time. Exclusively.
    466039|00000000||Tended to the corpses in the mass graves. Incinerated 'em all.
    466041|00000000||Hm, have you any proof?
    466043|00000000||Proof? Whaddaya want, a fistful of ashes? If you don't believe me, take a stroll across the battlefield, see for yourself.
   1024741|00000000||You're a man of the cloth - ghouls and graveirs shouldn't bother you.
    466045|00000000||My , my, irritable, aren't we. No reason. You must practice the virtue of patience, my son. Take this and go in peace.
    465960|00000000||Took care of the graves.
    466029|00000000||Farewell.
    465962|00000000||So long.
    465958|00000000||Why hadn't anyone burned the corpses earlier?
    466023|00000000||Why'd you priests take an interest in the fallen so late?
    466025|00000000||The Church of the Eternal Fire's first duty is to the living. You've no notion of the work we did just after the battle.
    467835|00000000||The wounded needed tending, refugees - pastoral care. We had sermons to deliver, donations to collect…
    467837|00000000||Relieved to hear it. What would the people've done without you?
    465952|00000000||Well, witcher? Have you completed your task?
    465993|00000000||All right. I'll take care of it.
    465995|00000000||This will count amongst your merits. The more good one works in life, the more… hallowed things are. Yes. Splendid. Here are the holy oils.
   1024839|00000000||Douse generously and set alight, understood? I wish it to flare up to the sky. For the glory of the Eternal Fire and all that.
    467790|00000000||Once I've incinerated the bodies, where'll I find you?
    467885|00000000||I shall be near the bridge to Novigrad.
    465954|00000000||Fine. I'll do it.
    465989|00000000||Not interested. Farewell.
    465956|00000000||Not interested.
    467726|00000000||Someone must see to the corpses on the battlefield. Necrophages defile those not already rotting in mass graves. This is not right.
   1024840|00000000||That's to be my good deed for the day?
    467732|00000000||A handsomely profitable one, I might add. I know your kind don't work for free.
    465972|00000000||What do you want?
    465974|00000000||Rejoice, for even a creature as depraved and base in nature as you can serve the glory of the Eternal Fire.
    320820|2ead98a4||Ciri
   1054619|00000000||The witch hunters' headquarters! It's burned down! 'Tis the doing of demonic powers!
   1054621|00000000||Good folk, we must rebuild! Together, as a congregation!
   1054623|00000000||And whosoever contributes coin to the cause, his sins shall be forgiven…
   1055748|00000000||Dammit. Gone off course.
   1055750|00000000||Race is over. Rode so far afield, they must've scratched me by now.
    418037|00000000||Have you heard? They're to burn a monster and a witch in the marketplace.
    418545|00000000||Let them do as they will. It's naught to me.
    418547|00000000||Hierarch Hemmelfart summoned all townsfolk to attend the execution.
    418549|00000000||I've no concern for that drunkard and even less respect. Hemmelfart's a fisstechist.
    418039|00000000||Speak softly lest they hear you and build another pyre.
    418041|00000000||And you still call this a free city? Governance by terror - that's what we've to expect now.
    478746|00000000||Thought you wanted to start at the tree?
    478747|00000000||Let's do what we came for and leave. Can't say I like this place.
    480589|00000000||Fine… I'll wait near the tree.
    478686|00000000||Worried this trail might've gone cold…
    478687|00000000||Even if Craven's dead… We'll manage.
    478688|00000000||How, exactly?
    478689|00000000||You'll see when the time comes.
    498062|00000000||You could stand to be nicer sometimes.
    498064|00000000||I suppose… but then I wouldn't be the woman you fell in love with, would I?
   1066639|00000000||Hey, Geralt! Come back!
    478705|00000000||You didn't mention your heroic battle with this Morkvarg character…
    478706|00000000||You know me… Don't like to take my work home…
    480585|00000000||Mhm. I'm afraid you don't like home - the very concept of it.
    480602|00000000||I asked you once to move to Vengerberg for me. Remember? Was that ever a row…
    480604|00000000||Yeah… Those were the days…
    478745|00000000||Ivy-covered walls, a mysterious garden… Shame we're not here under different circumstances …
   1056136|00000000||My, my… That must be Morkvarg… Quite the appetite.
   1056138|00000000||Mhm. Might even call it wolven…
   1042638|00000000||He doesn't seem happy to see us.
   1042640|00000000||Wait till he gets a closer look at me.
    478771|00000000||So, where shall we start?
    480501|00000000||Let's go to that tree the sisters mentioned.
    478772|00000000||Plan to bleed yourself for the goddess?
    478773|00000000||Not necessarily. But Craven did… We just might pick up his scent.
   1047814|00000000||Watch out!
   1047812|00000000||Dammit.
   1047815|00000000||Stay close to me.
   1047817|00000000||Who are you?!
   1047819|00000000||Show yourself! I wanna talk!
    406501|00000000||Dammit. They knew I was coming, sealed the passage.
    481187|00000000||Show her how it's done!
    571722|00000000||Huh? Huh?
    571724|00000000||Where ye rushin' to?
    571726|00000000||Happy trails!
    448047|00000000||Everything all right?
    448049|00000000||A few bites on my feet and calves. Nothing, really.
    455684|00000000||Need to clean your wounds. Infection'll set in otherwise.
    455686|00000000||Later, Geralt. Let's find the way to the port, first.
    573584|00000000||[PL] Nothing to Chicken Test for q306_maverick right now.
    574226|00000000||[PL] [DEBUG] No, I have a shitty card deck
    574225|00000000||[PL] [DEBUG] Yes, I have a good card deck
    556348|00000000||Seems you got a problem. Some graves get dug up?
    556349|00000000||If that were only it… Every now and then a vile beast'd come 'round the graveyard, devour what's fresh, then move on…
   1025979|00000000||Started again not long past. Thought to meself, just don't step out after dark and lock your door tight. But then a young 'un went missin'…
    556350|00000000||From the graveyard?
    556351|00000000||Nay, from the village. Little snotter wouldn'ta come here of his own. And I'd heard somethin' like a whimper the night…
    595317|00000000||Didn't bother to come out, see what was happening?
    595318|00000000||Think me daft? If you've monsters, ye need a witcher.
   1041656|00000000||See if I can learn what's out there.
   1041657|00000000||See what I can do.
    445126|00000000||Take care.
    445124|00000000||Farewell.
   1041676|00000000||Sorry, gotta pass on this job for now.
   1041674|00000000||Gonna pass on this job.
   1041658|00000000||My reward - let's talk.
   1041660|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1067369|00000000||Hoo, well, that's expectin' a lot. Much too much, so to speak.
   1067371|00000000||Just the tiniest bit dear, but we'll settle soon, I can see that. Hagglin's as much an art as… err, lots of other arts!
   1067375|00000000||What?! That much?! Must be drunk on fool's parsley tea! I better figure the price.
   1067373|00000000||Rate's fair, considerin' the job. I know a bit about these things.
   1041680|00000000||Figured ye could use that copper after all, eh?
   1026038|00000000||And?
    556533|00000000||It's taken care of. It was a grave hag that dug up the graves and snatched the child.
    556536|00000000||Aye, so… how is the little tyke?
   1023797|00000000||Found him in the grave hag's lair. In her cauldron, to be precise… want me to go on?
   1023798|00000000||Might've not even said that much…
   1023792|00000000||Found him…
   1023789|00000000||Dead.
   1023795|00000000||Child's dead.
   1023796|00000000||Oh, 'tis as I thought.
   1023799|00000000||What about my reward?
   1023800|00000000||Oh, I've not forgotten, nay. Here ye go, thanks much for your help.
   1044765|00000000||Will ye hunt the monster? Though I cannot say what nature o' beast it is.
   1044768|00000000||Somethin' prowls the graveyard nights. Young 'uns from the village 'ave gone missin'. But what's done it - I've nary a clue.
   1041652|00000000||It was a grave hag. Made its lair nearby.
   1044771|00000000||Was? Mean to say it's dead already? Made quick work o' that, you did.
   1041650|00000000||Here about the job.
    445122|00000000||Here about the job.
    445120|00000000||Hm?
    595264|00000000||Screech, creak, fiddle string! Me ghostly laddie, dance!
    595265|00000000||For all of stolen coppers three,
    595266|00000000||a great feast tonight will be.
    595267|00000000||Ravens, worms and creepin' rats
    595268|00000000||will have a mighty treat of thee.
   1023810|00000000||Greetings! Since ye killed the hag, been so silent in the graveyard ye can hear the maggots workin'!
   1014592|00000000||Nonsense. I need no spell. These boys come 'ere themselves. In fact, I must use magic to drive them away, make them go home! Only Ramund was nice, so I let him stay.
    556180|00000000||Met a lot of succubi on the Path. None set out to hurt anyone, but they all killed, eventually. Lost themselves when feeding, drained their lovers dry of life force.
    556181|00000000||Not her, she's different!
   1014627|00000000||Out of my way. And don't interfere.
    556178|00000000||You're right. She needs to die.
   1014738|00000000||Can think of another way you can repay me. I'm looking for pimpernel. You know this forest. Maybe you could help me?
   1014740|00000000||I shall take you myself… And you, Ramund, go pick some more violets. Just the indigo ones this time!
   1014742|00000000||Indigo… You mean blue?
   1014744|00000000||No. Indigo is indigo.
   1014746|00000000||Ahh, men…
   1014735|00000000||Know of another way you can repay me.
   1014736|00000000||Why not?
   1014752|00000000||Tell me why not. Is it the scars?
   1014754|00000000||I detest when a man smells of blood. You witchers always reek of it. Fiend blood, chort blood - and these are my brethren.
   1014755|00000000||You're right. But unlike fiends and chorts, you--
   1014758|00000000||Have ample breasts and a pretty face? I know. Their lack of these attributes - is that what makes them easy to kill?
   1014759|00000000||It's a bit more complicated than that… But never mind. No means no - I get it.
    556182|00000000||I don't see any reason to kill her. She's a monster, sure… but a sentient one, and basically harmless.
    556183|00000000||No such thing - just as there's no dry water, no cold fire. But if you'll not help, very well, I shall tend to her myself.
    556495|00000000||I'd advise against it.
    556496|00000000||I will return. With one who does not carry a sword for show.
   1014707|00000000||Why did you take my side? I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed - I don't generally couple with witchers, especially not out of gratitude.
    556179|00000000||She's harmless.
   1014596|00000000||Witcher, you've been here! You saw! Ramund's not been harmed in any way!
   1014594|00000000||I see through your lies - your wretched charm won't work on me! I shall kill you here and now, monster!
   1014555|00000000||We saw what happens to those who land in this beast's embrace! We saw Jorre's body!
   1014590|00000000||Then you saw I buried his body as custom dictates! I did not seek his death. He… He was very old, his heart was weak. I warned him it could end that way… But he kept returning!
   1014544|00000000||Hoho! No no, hoho, stop, please! Haha! Hoho, this is great. No-o! No! Stop! Ahh, please!
   1014547|00000000||Stop it, that tickles! Hohoho! Two can play at this game you horny goat woman.
   1014549|00000000||Unhand him, hellish creature! Ramund! Step away from her!
   1014551|00000000||Ah, calm down! I've not been harmed! I came here--
   1014553|00000000||You don't know what you're saying. She's cast a spell on you!
    481475|00000000||Alms for the poor?
    422836|00000000||You lame?
    422838|00000000||No chance! Both legs in perfect order. And me arms - look, like a windmill's wings.
    427482|00000000||There - see me wavin' 'em? Lookie here. Just look!
    427484|00000000||And my mind - thorough addled.
    422844|00000000||Looking for the Putrid Grove.
    422860|00000000||Need to find the Putrid Grove.
    422868|00000000||Looking for the Putrid Grove.
    430723|00000000||See ya.
    430727|00000000||Farewell.
    422850|00000000||I gotta find the place they call the Putrid Grove.
    422852|00000000||I know it but won't say. I know it but won't say.
    422854|00000000||Why not?
    422856|00000000||Not allowed to say. I would tell you, though. If you didn't push, weren't so insistent. If you like, come again. Might tell you then.
    481477|00000000||Guess your mind is truly addled.
    481479|00000000||Didn't I say so?!
   1075580|00000000||So, like I said… I'm looking for the Putrid Grove.
   1075582|00000000||Second time round, your wish is my command! It's thataway, there!
    422840|00000000||Thataway, meaning where?
    427486|00000000||In Lacehalls. There's this alley, past a gate. Not at all putrid and not a grove. Fools call it that, but I know better.
   1044300|00000000||And anyone can go there?
   1044302|00000000||O' course. Unless he forgets to say "The old sow's farrowed piglets." Might not let you in, then. But that's easy enough to say. Listen: The old sow's farrowed piglets. See?
    427488|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    358380|00000000||So you gotta know where the Putrid Grove is, right?
    358382|00000000||Most certainly do! It's where I live! Over the, uh, there, there, thataway.
    422870|00000000||You're happy. That's what counts.
    422872|00000000||I am. When folk ask me the way, I like that most. 'Cause I can point - like this, there, ah! 'Cause I know my way around the city. Oh, do I ever.
    422866|00000000||Guess you're happy. That's what counts.
    422862|00000000||Healthy as a horse as far as I can tell.
    422864|00000000||Priests have looked, medics, herbalists. All claimed I'm bewildered.
    427494|00000000||Well they're wrong.
    427496|00000000||Matters little either way. Folk are generous to me. They enjoy watching me point, like this: there, there.
    422858|00000000||You're the picture of health.
    422846|00000000||Been like this long - addled?
    422848|00000000||Since me mother birthed me.
    427492|00000000||Here's where it's addled. There. Showin' you with me finger. See that? Me indicatin'!
    422842|00000000||Been addled long - your mind?
    481481|00000000||Ah… it's you again! Another chat, same as the first? My mind's thorough addled, but the rest of me's fit as a fiddle.
    439768|00000000||You! We wander this place because of you!
    439770|00000000||I've waited long enough for revenge! And now he comes to us on his own!
    475203|00000000||It's burning!
    475205|00000000||Baron set the stables afire!
   1006835|00000000||Did my part. Now you need to look after her.
   1006837|00000000||Did my part. Your turn now. Take care of her, good care.
   1006839|00000000||I will, you'll see. Treat her better than the dryads of Brokilon could.
   1013734|00000000||She's talking again. Nice surprise.
   1013736|00000000||Isn't it? Professor von Gratz told me her wounds are healing faster than a troll's. Not the most flattering comparison but… encouraging. Maybe-- She might even sing again some day.
   1013738|00000000||For now we'll try performing as a duo. She'll play the lute, I'll sing. "Dandelion and Callonetta." Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
   1013740|00000000||Sounds great. Good luck, Dandelion. On stage and off.
   1006845|00000000||Don't mention it. Nothing a friend wouldn't do.
   1006834|00000000||No need.
   1006823|00000000||How's…?
   1006825|00000000||Better. Right?
   1006827|00000000||Y-yes.
   1006829|00000000||Did you take care of… what I asked?
   1006831|00000000||Yeah. The witcher's way.
   1006833|00000000||Thank you, Geralt. From me and Priscilla.
   1015331|00000000||Yes. Promised to help, didn't I?
   1015328|00000000||Yes.
   1015334|00000000||No. Changed my mind.
   1015336|00000000||A true shame.
   1015329|00000000||Sorry. Changed my mind.
   1015327|00000000||You remember our deal, right? You will stay to the tournament's end?
    581570|00000000||Congratulations.
   1014168|00000000||I like men who know how to lose.
   1055247|0facf405||Wealthy Townsman
    487146|00000000||Greetings.
    487148|00000000||Greetin's to you.
    487150|00000000||Other villagers all scurried off soon as they saw me. You didn't.
    487151|00000000||Oh, I-- I'm too old to scurry! Besides, what could you do to me?
    487154|00000000||Kill me? Go ahead - I've not long to live. Tan me hide? Wouldn't work - me skin's right brittle.
    474192|00000000||So? Change your mind? A bit o' coin and I'll tell you how to get in.
    474176|00000000||Fine. Don't really feel like arguing with the guards.
    476556|00000000||Years back, when the old lord still ruled Crow's Perch, the blacksmith's boy went missing.
    476558|00000000||Whole village looked for him. No luck. Finally found the boy in the river - he'd drowned.
    476560|00000000||Tragic. But how's that supposed to help me?
    476562|00000000||A few days on, an old woman who served the lord found the boy's cap near the castle well.
    474178|00000000||So, either he lost it there, or he fell in the well.
    476571|00000000||Clever man. Village folk built a shrine where they found the lad's body. Northwest of here. Wager you'll find an entrance to a passage nearby…
    474180|00000000||Shrine, where is it exactly?
   1063316|00000000||Track that weaves through the village - follow it to the bridge. Turn right past that, then go on straight as piss till you get to a crossroads. Turn right again, then follow that path up a hill. Shrine stands upon it.
   1063340|00000000||Right past the bridge, then right again. I'll find it. Thanks.
    474169|00000000||All right, I'll pay.
    474184|00000000||Won't finagle any coin out of me. If there's another way in, I'll find it.
    474186|00000000||Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
    474188|00000000||Thanks, but think I'll manage on my own.
    474190|00000000||As you will.
    474171|00000000||Not about to let you cheat me.
    476545|00000000||Why help me?
    476547|00000000||Just looking to make some coin, or is there another reason you're helping me?
    476549|00000000||What you did at the Crossroads - that's why they won't let you in, right?
    476551|00000000||The innkeep? My sister's husband.
    487158|00000000||Lived here long?
    487160|00000000||Hmm… erm… Since I was born. Reckon that'll be more than seventy winters!
    487162|00000000||Must know the area well…
    487164|00000000||Not bad.
    487165|00000000||Listen, I gotta get inside the fortress. Can I do that without going through the front gate?
    487168|00000000||Ye can, but few know the way.
    487170|00000000||If you were to make an 'umble offerin', call it, to this 'umble man, maybe I could point you in the right direction.
    487155|00000000||Know the area well?
    487172|00000000||Take care.
    487173|00000000||Aye, you too. And fortune smile upon ye.
    487156|00000000||Farewell.
    487176|00000000||Ah, back again. Whaddaya need, my good man?
    571082|00000000||Bed, table, a few chairs… Modest, but a home nonetheless.
    571098|00000000||Blood-stained surgical instruments… Philippa operated on someone here.
    571122|00000000||Notes… Charred, almost completely.
    589567|00000000||Can't read a thing.
    571236|00000000||Agates. Kind Philippa always wore around her neck.
    589752|00000000||Except… why're these covered in blood?
    589754|00000000||She either fought someone… or used them in her experiments.
    571449|00000000||A megascope… scorched, covered in soot…
    589774|00000000||Maybe one of the crystals survived.
    571648|00000000||Hmm, what's this?
    589757|00000000||Aniseed and birch bark… Powerful disinfectant.
    571651|00000000||Agates covered in cloth.
    589769|00000000||Maybe… a failed experiment? Then Philippa threw these across the cave?
    589771|00000000||That'd be like her.
    572103|00000000||A remex… its edge frayed.
    589507|00000000||This is an owl feather.
    572422|00000000||Another feather. Doubt Philippa had an aviary - these are signs of polymorphy.
    589491|00000000||Love letters?
    589509|00000000||Hm, interesting… Philippa dumped some woman - for Dijkstra.
    481185|00000000||Go on!
    173994|00000000||So here our paths diverge. Thank you, Dea. Go in peace.
    326915|00000000||Bits of pipe clear over here. Must've been one powerful blast.
    544065|00000000||Why ye wanderin' the streets, eh? Temptin' decent men into indecent thoughts?
    544066|00000000||I… I must go to the well…
    544067|00000000||Suuure… to poison it, no doubt!
   1003864|00000000||Few young men've come home, the war took many…
   1003866|00000000||I came home.
   1003868|00000000||Aye, and you're different now…
   1003870|00000000||Different - how?
   1003872|00000000||You're starvin'…
    445936|00000000||Geralt? Can you hear me? How goes it? Where are you?
    445938|00000000||Almost there!
   1073512|00000000||Splendid. I shall contact you again soon.
   1073514|00000000||Wait! This xenovox - can I contact you with it, or is it one way?
   1073518|00000000||One way only, I'm afraid. You'll have to trust my feminine intuition.
   1073522|00000000||Your what?
   1073524|00000000||My feminine intuition!
   1073526|00000000||Wonderful.
   1053620|00000000||All them folk livin' fine got their cognac and wine, but me I don't mind humble ryyyyyye…
   1053622|00000000||I won't get on a boat, you won't see me afloat, lest you give this old goat humble ryyyyyye.
   1053624|00000000||And when I get dizzy, and me insides go squizzy, to the privy I take me 'umble ryyyyye.
   1054351|00000000||Kill one more beast and they'll give you the keys to the city!
    449982|00000000||Bloody hell? What the--?
    449984|00000000||Water hags.
    449986|00000000||Where's a horror like that come from?
    451741|00000000||A wench that's had too much hooch turns into that. So next time you think to give a woman booze, don't. Better off drinkin' it down yourself!
   1007389|00000000||Ready?
   1007390|00000000||Not yet!
   1007391|00000000||Uh-huh.
   1022589|00000000||Thief, skulls he stole… My skulls! Ought to dig up his own…
    556039|00000000||There she is - right on cue…
   1032371|00000000||Dance - it's a beautiful thing. I could sit here for hours, just admiring.
   1032373|00000000||Uh-huh. Even if it were me cavorting on stage?
   1032375|00000000||Uh, that would change things…
   1032377|00000000||Ah, so it's not dance you admire, but dancing girls.
    595619|0e97bfe2||Elf
    444323|00000000||What happened, kid?
    444325|00000000||They… They…
    563185|00000000||Hel… Help.
   1009216|00000000||The gray git!
    186005|00000000||Now children, as you know, a ratcatcher was to visit us today to talk about his trade.
    498011|00000000||Yeah!
    498014|00000000||When's he gonna be here?
    357091|00000000||It turns out he'll not come after all.
    357093|00000000||Why not?
    357095|00000000||A rat bit him, and he's caught a fever.
    357097|00000000||Where'd he get bit?
    498428|00000000||It hurt 'im much?
    498429|00000000||Will he die?
    357099|00000000||You don't die from rats, stupid.
    498432|00000000||Yes you do. Just the other day I saw a witch hunter tell a man, "You rat"! And then he killed 'im!
    498435|00000000||Liar!
    357109|00000000||That's enough! We're done for the day. Gather your things and go home.
   1052670|00000000||M'lady took me aside th'other day. Accused me of mismanagin' her coin!
   1052672|00000000||That's rich!
   1052674|00000000||I told her if that's how it's gonna be, I'll start buyin' the slop the elves eat.
   1052676|00000000||Oh, that should've set her in place.
   1052678|00000000||Maybe. But it stands to get worse if the war lasts another year. Prices'll rise even more.

    414857|00000000||Remember our deal, I hope.
    414859|00000000||I switched his sword for a rusty one. You need to hold on for a moment.
    414861|00000000||I'll hold on, all right. And then… I'll gut the arse munch.
   1054343|00000000||Oh! A witcher. Feel safer already.
    565812|80ecfb08||Refugee
    492062|00000000||Got an itch 'neath me ball sack.
    492064|00000000||Why you starin'? Lookin' to get smacked, Nordling?
    492063|00000000||The Tuirseach clan, we're kings among the clans…
    492061|00000000||A life on the ocean waves, a-home on the rollin' deep!
    525965|00000000||The men of this family have little luck. Skaron Vegelbud died young…
    525967|00000000||Do you think the women, they… ?
    525969|00000000||I can't be certain, but rumors abound…
    525971|00000000||Apparently they have this contraption at the Passiflora.
    525973|00000000||Tis an offence to nature! Does the Temple Guard know what goes on there?
    525976|00000000||Shh! The Guard is well aware.
    525978|00000000||Hmm… And you say the price is reasonable?
    526005|00000000||Times of famine and war are necessary. They are how society purges itself, regenerates.
    526063|00000000||Indeed. Naturally, this only applies to the lower orders. And nonhumans.
    178027|00000000||Back to the fortress.
    173965|00000000||What? With this?
    178029|00000000||As I recall, you were the one wanted to test the old legends, change it into a lubberkin.
    413992|00000000||Oh fuck…
    384642|00000000||But… but what do you want to do with it?
    384644|00000000||Me? Nothing. This is your job. Told you, gotta bury it under the threshold. If the tales are true, by tomorrow it'll be a lubberkin.
    384646|00000000||From then on it'll watch over your house, and help me find your family.
    411181|00000000||Hungry specters. Botchling's scent attracted them.
   1053180|00000000||On my mother's grave… Do something!
   1048838|00000000||More coming. Need to hurry.
   1053189|00000000||On with it! I'll not wait till they devour us!
    487954|00000000||We need one alive!
    487953|00000000||Goddammit!
   1000662|00000000||They don't have anyone else.
   1000756|00000000||They don't have anyone else.
   1000758|00000000||Sheesh. Thanks, Geralt. If you meant to say something nice, try again.
   1000768|00000000||I'm glad we came here, together.
   1000770|00000000||Really? Despite all these bloated nobles, the bowing, the fake smiles?
   1000777|00000000||Mhm. Not often we get the chance to just talk.
   1000779|00000000||Something you've been meaning to say to me?
   1000759|00000000||Glad we came here.
   1000812|00000000||Uh, you look nice.
   1000818|00000000||Pfff, a witcher's compliments…
   1000771|00000000||You look nice.
   1000760|00000000||Your eyes are like stars.
   1000781|00000000||Your eyes, they're like stars.
   1000783|00000000||Hmmmm… Geraaalt…
   1000785|00000000||Really, they're incredibly shiny. Could be the wine. You better not drink anymore.
   1000811|00000000||You're terrible, you know that?
   1000661|00000000||Personal charm.
   1000752|00000000||Personal charm - that's what it's about.
   1000754|00000000||Hahaha. Careful - that sounded like a compliment.
   1000828|00000000||Didn't mean it to. Don't quite know why I always say stuff like that around you.
   1000835|00000000||Always? Guess I remember things a little differently…
   1000819|00000000||Wasn't supposed to.
   1000762|00000000||Good.
   1000821|00000000||Glad it did.
   1000826|00000000||Oh. Are you trying to…?
    510399|00000000||Someone's coming.
    510402|00000000||Is it Albert?
    510405|00000000||No, just some lost guest. Shh!
    510407|00000000||Heeheehee. Must be looking for his beloved.
   1000659|00000000||Like in that elven tale about the frog and the lark. "Inchu, inchu, beag broggha…" "Inch by inch, little frog…" Heeheehee.
    510412|00000000||Sshhhh! Let's go.
   1003414|00000000||Hahahha.
   1000664|00000000||You're a charismatic leader. Simple as that.
   1000666|00000000||You really think so?
   1000668|00000000||Absolutely. Next thing you know they'll be calling you Iron Merigold. Could even wear an eye patch and it'd look right.
   1000670|00000000||Hahah. For a moment there I thought you were being sincere.
   1000678|00000000||Course I'm being sincere. Look at me - didn't blush a bit.
   1000680|00000000||Hahahah.
   1000660|00000000||Simple - you're charismatic.
    528857|00000000||Got the impression he doesn't exactly like you.
    528944|00000000||I just think he'd love to have me as his charge, rather than his leader.
    528946|00000000||See, but you're the one organizing the mages' escape from Novigrad.
    528948|00000000||Sometimes I have no idea how I actually managed to bring them all together…
    528711|00000000||Got the impression he doesn't like you…
    528712|00000000||Where do you know him from?
    528716|00000000||How'd you meet?
    528732|00000000||Geralt, all mages know each other. Some are well over a century old - that's plenty of time to make acquaintances.
    528734|00000000||In that case: when did you meet him?
    528747|00000000||At a feast, long ago. He walked up and… just blatantly offered to teleport us somewhere … quieter.
    528841|00000000||Seems like just the type.
    528843|00000000||Really. At the time, to me he seemed… sweet.
    528807|00000000||Seems the type.
    528806|00000000||You turn him down?
    528837|00000000||You turn him down?
    528839|00000000||Is that what you think?
    528852|00000000||He actually pursued me for a while afterwards.
   1074402|00000000||Relieved to get that mask off. If only for a little.
    528684|00000000||Great view from here. And there's even wine.
    528687|00000000||It's been so long since I've been to a feast, ball or reception. Amazingly pleasant change from the sewers of Novigrad.
    528689|00000000||So, does this mean it's a good time to ask you about…
    528691|00000000||Yes?
    526410|00000000||About that mage we met earlier.
    528707|00000000||Ah, Moritz. What do you want to know?
    577978|fcd21ea9||Halfling
    544654|00000000||Well, well! Look who's here? The White Wolf himself in my humble establishment!
   1032398|00000000||I need coin. Guess I have to take out a loan?
   1032400|00000000||Course. I'll arrange it right away.
   1032402|00000000||Just like that?
   1032404|00000000||Lady Yennefer of Vengerberg long ago declared herself your guarantor - were these circumstances ever to arise.
   1032406|00000000||Besides, we've tried and true methods for collecting debts.
   1032393|00000000||Need a loan.
   1032416|00000000||Wanna pay back my loan.
   1032418|00000000||Splendid. I see you as even more credit worthy than before.
   1032394|00000000||Wanted to pay back my loan.
   1032408|00000000||Got a bill of exchange. Need to redeem it.
   1032410|00000000||I'll need a spell to verify that the issuer's credit worthy. But it shouldn't take long.
   1032395|00000000||Got a bill of exchange to redeem.
   1032412|00000000||Got some coin I'd like to convert into crowns.
   1032414|00000000||You've come to the right place. A better rate you'll not find anywhere in the city.
   1032396|00000000||I'd like to convert some currency.
    544636|00000000||Till next time.
    544634|00000000||Farewell.
    544633|00000000||How's business?
    544637|00000000||How's business?
    544638|00000000||Really? That's the best you've got? That's like asking a fisherman if they're biting, or an old gran about her health.
   1031244|00000000||Business is booming. There's profit to be made from war, provided you've the know-how. Before Nilfgaard had even crossed the Pontar, I'd contracted for insured deliveries of wood and iron from Kovir. Reaped a sevenfold return on my investment.
   1031246|00000000||Nice.
   1031248|00000000||So you might think. But then there's the nonhuman poll tax, the church's tithe, war taxes and my overhead. Subtract all that and you're left with a pittance - a dozen or so chests, and no more.
    544655|00000000||How can I be of service?
    441141|00000000||What happened here?
    441524|00000000||It attacked us… Gods, I dunno what it were, at least four spans high! Tell me, the others, are--
    445503|00000000||They're dead.
    513682|00000000||Avenge them, witcher. Kill the beast, please. I-I've nothin' to pay you with… but Mikkel, the one who brought us here, his brother's got coin, he'll reward you! Look for him at the Inn at the Crossroads.
   1052129|00000000||The gods watch over ye, witcher!
   1049794|00000000||Head back to the village. The way out's safe now. I'm staying here.
    529638|00000000||Let's pretend I didn't hear that. Now get out of here, before I get tired of playing make-believe.
    529639|00000000||I see you lot are tough in the tongue and nowhere else.
    529640|00000000||Fuck this, we gonna let some dandy's boyfriend scare us?! Let's show 'im how things are done on our turf!
    529636|00000000||Leave him alone.
    529641|00000000||You're right. Not my problem.
    529642|00000000||Damn straight, I'm right. Been a pleasure.
    529637|00000000||You're right. Out of my element.
    529626|00000000||And you - don't you butt in like a belch between two pints, 'cause you're out of your fuckin' element.
    529635|00000000||So make like a hare and sod off.
   1088513|00000000||Botchling
    569169|00000000||Farewell.
    569175|00000000||Farewell.
    569168|00000000||Never promised to defend you from humans.
    569173|00000000||Killing humans - not part of our deal.
    569177|00000000||Go, begone. Pellar's done with you.
    569171|00000000||I'm… sorry.
    569167|00000000||Sorry.
    558689|00000000||Trusted you, the pellar did. Help you promised!
    172237|00000000||I've been robbed!
    427712|00000000||There's a third way out of this situation.
    427703|00000000||There's a third option.
    427714|00000000||Not my business. Just hope you had a good reason.
    427705|00000000||This is not my concern.
    427708|00000000||What's going on here? Why isn't anyone putting that out?
    427710|00000000||We want it to burn, got it?
    451518|00000000||Piss off or we'll fry you along with that fuckin' elf.
   1003164|00000000||Let's go.
   1041944|00000000||Thought you were in a hurry.
   1041946|00000000||Well? Coming?
   1041948|00000000||Geeeralt!
   1051451|00000000||I dislike this place. Vehemently.
   1051453|00000000||Oh, anything for a hot bath.
   1051449|00000000||Certainly hope we haven't lost our way…
   1051455|00000000||The sooner we can leave, the better.
    594622|00000000||I doubt it's me you're looking for.
   1032791|00000000||Thank you, master! Who would've thought it was Rejk…
    594624|00000000||Mhmmm….
    594626|00000000||Eternal Fire be with you.
    504254|00000000||At last.
    504256|00000000||You have not forgotten. You've returned for me.
    504258|00000000||I-is-is th-that…?
    504259|00000000||Don't you recognize me? It's me, Anabelle, the one you abandoned, remember?
    504267|00000000||Anabelle, I-- I was sure ye was dead. If I'd known otherwise, I'd a never have left ye!
    504269|00000000||I'd do anythin' for ye, I would. Ye know that well. Believe me, I beg ye.
    504291|00000000||Prove it.
    504313|00000000||Kiss me.
    504293|00000000||Graham, careful…
   1038866|00000000||No.
   1038870|00000000||Not really. Mainly hunt.
   1039169|00000000||Good, that. One lyin' angler at the table's enough. Come on in.
   1038868|00000000||Yeah. Cast an earthworm the other day, caught this huuuge perch--
   1039175|00000000||In the Pontar?
   1039177|00000000||You betcha!
   1039179|00000000||Ca-- Can't listen to this hogwash sober. Come in.
   1038865|00000000||Yes.
   1037166|00000000||Chivay?
   1037172|00000000||Caesar Bilzen! Remember our quarrel about who's King of the Pontar?
   1038514|00000000||The pike's King of the Pontar.
   1038515|00000000||Ah, well, you see, I've come to convince you it's the catfish. And I do not come empty-handed.
   1038522|00000000||Who's he?
   1038862|00000000||Oh, him? Oh that's, that's Geralt.
   1038864|00000000||Does, uh, Geralt fish?
    468023|00000000||Fine… Last round for me, though…
    468019|00000000||Last round for me…
    468031|00000000||Apologies. But, er… when the going gets tough… How's that go, again…? Ehh, I gotta go.
   1032644|00000000||What's the rush, master witcher?! A nekker's no hare, it shan't run off on you. Although… Actually… It does have legs… Well then! Be off!
    468021|00000000||Had enough, boys.
    453926|00000000||Gentlemen… I am soused, pickled, crocked and stewed…
    468017|00000000||Heeheehee… want another term for your state?
    453934|00000000||Don't be vulgar! What will our new friend think… Pour another!
    577808|00000000||Got a razor and shears? Good. Make me look decent.
   1066776|00000000||Greetings, master. What can I do for you?
   1066777|00000000||Looking to get a haircut.
   1066778|00000000||Farewell.
   1042228|00000000||No. I let him go.
   1042622|00000000||Oh, I knew I shoulda gone with ye. You know he has it in for me. He'll be doubly determined now.
   1042624|00000000||Doubt it. Think he's likely to quit the business… if he gets out of there alive.
   1042207|00000000||Prefer the coin.
   1042240|00000000||Rather have the coin.
   1042242|00000000||It's yours. I'll still pay the King of Beggars on time. Oh won't that cocksucker be surprised!
   1042630|00000000||Good luck, Zoltan.
   1042632|00000000||Thanks, Geralt. And remember - the catfish is the King of the Pontar!
   1042236|00000000||Kinda curious how the cards might serve me.
   1042238|00000000||Excellent! I'll take the coin to the King of Beggars right away. Surprise the prick!
   1042184|00000000||I'll take the cards.
   1042230|00000000||Well, Geralt! What's your preference - coin or cards? I'd never hae managed without you, so you choose.
   1043914|00000000||If ye want gold, it's not a problem. I'll find another buyer for these cards in a flash.
   1042226|00000000||Mhm.
   1042620|00000000||Ah, that's grand.
   1042616|00000000||So? You get 'im? You get the coin?
   1042146|00000000||Yes.
   1042618|00000000||And what about Duke? Finish him off?
    505733|00000000||Hey, look! This wayfarer wants to fight Durden the Tailor!
    505734|00000000||Is the Tailor cut out to remain champion?! We will soon know.
    505735|00000000||He is.
   1071547|00000000||Next time I mention card tradin', be sure and bop me in the head.
   1071549|00000000||With a wagon axle.
   1000875|00000000||Had a little problem.
   1000881|00000000||Ran into some trouble.
   1000884|00000000||Hunters? Will they come here?
   1000907|00000000||No. We've got some time. But please send someone to the garden. Needs a little tidying.
   1000937|00000000||Glad I could help.
   1000947|00000000||Glad I could help you collect it. You'll find good use for it?
    435448|00000000||I'm sorry, I acted irresponsibly. It was the wine, too strong.
    435475|00000000||No need to apologize. It was… nothing.
    435477|00000000||Yes, nothing.
    435525|00000000||We need to go.
    435531|00000000||I know. Be careful.
    511091|00000000||Miss Merigold…
    435487|00000000||We shouldn't have… It was my fault, I know. The wine… went straight to my head. I'm sorry.
    435489|00000000||Triss… Don't apologize.
   1000964|00000000||What happened at the fountain…
   1000949|00000000||It's finally possible, probable, even - that we can get all the mages out of Novigrad.
   1000957|00000000||You know where to find me if you want to say goodbye.
   1000962|00000000||Goodbye?
   1000938|00000000||Excellent. So where're we gonna get away to?
   1000945|00000000||You? Nowhere.
   1000936|00000000||Great. So where're we going?
   1000930|00000000||Everything set?
   1000935|00000000||Yes. Got your swords back from the guard. And Ingrid gave me the coin. It's, uh… more than I expected. Stunningly more, frankly.
   1000927|00000000||I shall see to it. And you must hurry.
   1000877|00000000||Everything's fine. Though you should probably send someone to… clean up the garden - before any guests wander in there.
   1000879|00000000||I'm to send servants to the garden?
   1000882|00000000||Yes.
   1000874|00000000||Everything's fine.
   1000873|00000000||I had begun to worry.
    173719|00000000||Horseshoe. No way a pitch burner could afford a horse.
   1004291|00000000||… And whosoever finds the baron's daughter will not go unrewarded!
   1004292|00000000||Would the baron like a new daughter?
   1004293|00000000||Got a few I can spare.
   1004294|00000000||I've a son to spare! A son's better, stronger!
    523670|00000000||Oh Melitele…
    523678|00000000||Master witchman, stay amongst us! Horrid wraiths spookin' about!
    523690|00000000||A necrophage'd rather eat ye alive than scavenge your carcass.
    523674|00000000||Ain't no sense gettin' worked up o'er nothin…
    523672|00000000||We oughta help one or t' other.
    523676|00000000||But a poor wench am I…
    523688|00000000||Master witchman?
    523680|00000000||Oh my.
    523682|00000000||Lebioda wept…
    523684|00000000||Good folk! Help me!
    523686|00000000||Me kiddy's ill, make 'im well, I beg of you.
    446893|00000000||Like dung that flows to the sewers, so the worst scum flows into Novigrad!
    446932|00000000||Sorceresses, their debauchery putting whores to shame… Alchemists violating divine commandments…
    446934|00000000||And worst of all - witchers! Mutants stripped of all emotion, bloodthirsty as vampires!
    463124|00000000||Graham, lemme in!
    463126|00000000||I told you, I don't wanna see no one!
    463128|00000000||But you've got to--
    463130|00000000||Just leave me be!
    421029|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421023|00000000||Show me what you've got.
    421033|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
    421025|00000000||Craft something for me?
   1086474|00000000||How about we play some gwent?
    421031|00000000||Huh. So long.
    421027|00000000||Farewell.
    497767|00000000||Are you a master weaponsmith?
    497769|00000000||Master-quality weapons - you capable of making them?
    497771|00000000||Who do you think I am, Hattori?
    497773|00000000||Hattori?
    497775|00000000||The master craftsman of Novigrad - why everyone's heard o' him. Says he's retired now, so no - ain't no one can do what you ask.
    421021|00000000||Trusty arms for all sorts! Steel swords and strong maces for the men folk, inlaid knuckle dusters for the lasses and ladies!
    498802|00000000||Will it be any good - the oil you made?
    498803|00000000||Not unless we want to anger it.
    498167|00000000||*Whistles*
    495830|00000000||The Wolf King! Now do you believe me?
    495831|00000000||I do. Hide!
    495824|00000000||Grrr grrr grrr…
    495825|00000000||Hey! W-wha…?
    569579|00000000||Where's that damned katakan?
    569580|00000000||Which way'd it go?
    569581|00000000||I can hear it.
    569582|00000000||It's going to the hut by the river.
    571246|00000000||A bracelet, pretty worn. Silver under the gilding. Too big for a woman's wrist…
   1050091|00000000||Attacker lost it, most likely.
    571325|00000000||He was drunk, someone dragged him over the cobblestones. Fang marks on his neck - vampire sucked his blood.
    571345|00000000||Vampire bites and the strong stench of alcohol. Just like the other one.
    571349|00000000||Fondness for jewelry, wounds on the victims' bodies - everything suggests a katakan.
   1040265|00000000||Except this vampire likes the blood of drunkards. That's the way to lure it out.
    571413|00000000||Once was a maid from Vicovaro, tight at night, she'd be loose come 'morrow, early in the morning!
   1040267|00000000||Another maid from Vicovaro, ploughed with pleasure and drank with sorrow, till early in the morning!
    571424|00000000||Our third maid was not demanding, gave it up to any man standing, early in the morning!
    571425|00000000||Katakan didn't hear it. I'll try another verse.
    571431|00000000||All right, all right, sheesh…
    571646|00000000||Damn it. Think I lost its trail.
    571655|00000000||It figured out something was up. Gotta search blind, now.
   1053740|00000000||Have you heard? The witch hunters have burnt Aeramas at the stake.
   1053742|00000000||Now what harm did that poor eccentric do anyone? He only divined from cheese, and that--
   1053744|00000000||I beg your pardon, did I hear you correctly? He divined… from cheese?
   1053746|00000000||Yes, from cheese. It's an art, apparently - tyromancy they call it. Aeramas was a world class expert.
   1053748|00000000||Apparently, when he first enrolled at Aretuza, he sought to delve into black magic. Reviving the dead, that sort of thing.
   1053750|00000000||But he became confused. Instead of signing up for necromancy, he chose tyromancy… Then he sort of stuck with it.
    173174|00000000||When she was a babe, my daughter loved animals.
    176237|00000000||Saw a deer trophy on a wall once. Do you know what she asked?
    176239|00000000||Haven't got a clue.
    176241|00000000||"Papa, is that deeh's wump on the other side of the wall?" Pwhahaha… You see it there? Whoaho! What a trophy! Hahaha…
    411204|00000000||I pity any bastard who's hurt her… I'll flay him alive.
    525257|00000000||A daredevil's come to challenge the Champion of Champions!
    525258|00000000||Geralt of Rivia has earned the right to fight the title holder! You may begin!
   1052342|00000000||Ye heard monsters have started prowlin' the outskirts?
   1052344|00000000||Rumors. The hierarch and the Guard'd never allow it.
   1052346|00000000||Really? So how would ye explain me wife's cousin gettin' murdered, his corpse reduced to bloody scraps?
   1052348|00000000||Rabble creepin' into Novigrad from the south, is all. And it'll get worse unless the war ends or they shut the gates to scum.
    453457|00000000||No way we can help her.
    453459|00000000||Nothing we can do to help her.
    499105|00000000||But we… No! That's impossible!
    453517|00000000||Dear daughter… Phillip…
    453636|00000000||Leave me be. Your pay will await you at Crow Perch. Collect it there.
    453527|00000000||It's good… to see you together…
    453533|00000000||I'm sorry, Annie. For everything… I'm sorry.
    453656|00000000||Mother…
    453555|00000000||Tammy… Do you remember? That day on the Ina…?
    453557|00000000||Of course. Those plums were so sweet, your dress so blue… You wove me a wreath of flowers. We laughed the day away.
    453564|00000000||Please… Remember me like that.
    453567|00000000||Noooo!
    453617|00000000||I thank you. They had a chance to say goodbye. That was your doing.
    569093|00000000||Shame I couldn't do more.
    569096|00000000||Come, child. The Eternal Fire will soothe your pain.
    453461|00000000||Hmm… The Crones deceived us. Their curse is a death sentence. No way to lift it, at least not in a way that would let Anna live.
    453487|00000000||We broke their spell temporarily, partly. Now it's gotta run its course.
    453473|00000000||What?! What does that mean?!
    453476|00000000||She's dying.
    453419|00000000||Crones tricked us.
    448922|00000000||Mum, you're back! All will be well, you're going to be fine.
    448924|00000000||Tammy… I'm dying…
    453425|00000000||She's not well, ravin'. Doesn't rightly know what's happenin'…
    500905|00000000||You're weak yet. You must rest.
    453409|00000000||No, listen to me… The Crones… I was to be their beast to the end, forever. You broke their spell, but now I must go.
    453417|00000000||Wh-What's she talking about, witcher?!
   1054309|00000000||Many thanks to you, Geralt!
   1015110|00000000||Gods… Priscilla! Is she gonna live?
   1002584|00000000||Who did this to her?
   1002586|00000000||Who coulda done this?
   1002588|00000000||That I do not know. I do, however, know she is not the perpetrator's first victim.
   1007258|00000000||Changed my mind - I'll help.
   1007260|00000000||I can help now.
   1007262|00000000||Thanks, Geralt. Really, thanks.
    568968|00000000||Well, then? Ready for a stroll through the sewers?
    568905|00000000||Join you later.
    568948|00000000||No. Need to tend to something first.
    568998|00000000||In that case, we shall met by the Kingfisher. I'll await you there.
   1002687|00000000||I'll get whoever did this, Dandelion. Even if it's Hierarch Hemmelfart himself.
   1002689|00000000||Thanks.
    568906|00000000||Mhm… Ready and intrigued.
    568904|00000000||Let's go.
   1002663|00000000||Think they'll let me into the morgue?
   1002665|00000000||By the main entrance? Certainly not. But you can also get inside through the sewers.
   1002667|00000000||The sewers… Travel them often, doctor?
   1002669|00000000||As often as required for, er… the pursuit of preventive medicine.
   1002671|00000000||Alternative treatments. Aggressive ones, I'm guessing. Interesting.
   1002673|00000000||We can discuss this en route. Are you ready?
   1002659|00000000||Can I get into the morgue?
   1002661|00000000||Putting yourself in danger.
   1002675|00000000||Great analogy, but this "tumor's" not gonna sit there, wait to be excised. Appreciate the help, but I doubt you know what you're getting yourself into.
   1002677|00000000||I know perfectly well. And I assure you, I can take care of myself.
   1002679|00000000||Easy assurance to make, harder to back up. Especially if you've spent your whole life wielding a scalpel, not a sword.
   1002681|00000000||Look at this scar. Don't be shy. Any idea what leaves such a mark?
   1002683|00000000||A flail… morningstar, maybe.
   1002685|00000000||What do you think? A blow sustained at the operating table? No? Let me repeat… I know what I'm doing. And I wish to help.
   1007257|00000000||Come on, Dandelion. Let's think about what we can do. I--
   1002653|00000000||I would suggest examining the previous victim's corpse. It has yet to be autopsied. Doing so could very well provide some clues.
   1002657|00000000||No need to look astonished, gentlemen. As a surgeon I know the importance of preventive medicine. Rather than wait for this maniac to strike again, I'd prefer to excise him. Not unlike a tumor.
   1007264|00000000||Don't need any convincing.
   1002594|00000000||How can you know that?
   1002596|00000000||I've seen wounds like this - they're not the kind one would forget, don't you agree? In fact, just this week a corpse turned up in the morgue with similar injuries - and no heart.
   1002600|00000000||No hea--? You mean, that might've happened to Priscilla? Is someone looking into this?
   1002602|00000000||This is Novigrad. Only the innocent burn here.
   1002604|00000000||Geralt… I know I owe you, a hundred times over. But I need to ask you another favor. Find the bastard who did this.
   1002606|00000000||Find him and kill him.
   1002590|00000000||So, this was no ordinary attack, no robbery.
   1002592|00000000||Clearly not… It was the act of a demented mind. And not its first.
   1002583|00000000||So this was no robbery, no ordinary attack.
    587748|00000000||I'd say that's certain. Her condition's critical but stable. Beg your pardon, but you are a relative?
    587751|00000000||Relative? No. A friend… A very close friend.
   1002574|00000000||Dandelion, correct? She uttered the name in her few moments of lucidity. I am Joachim von Gratz. Head of surgery. Until recently, a lecturer at Oxenfurt Academy.
   1002576|00000000||Enough of the courtesies. What're her injuries? Besides her eye.
   1002578|00000000||A concussion, cranial swelling, incision into her larynx and scalding inside the throat and esophagus. Clearly, someone forced her to imbibe a caustic fluid.
   1015112|00000000||Geralt! Finally! Look what they did… I mean, who… Wait, the surgeon's here! Doctor… She'll recover, right?
   1002642|00000000||Count on it.
   1002645|00000000||I can't do this now. I'm sorry. Gotta focus on Ciri, she--
   1002647|00000000||Matters the world to you. You'd do anything for her.
   1002649|00000000||Believe me, I know the feeling… Go. Good luck.
   1002643|00000000||Can't do this now.
    509539|00000000||Need to talk about your excursion to Novigrad.
    509546|00000000||Your excursion to Novigrad - we should talk about it.
    457687|00000000||Oh, so you are…
    457689|00000000||Yes. When can we leave the estate?
    457691|00000000||Weeeelll… Mama said it would be best to wait until everyone's drunk. Besides, there'll be fireworks later - a jolly good distraction.
   1000855|00000000||Once they've begun, I shall slip away, saunter into the garden. We will meet in the hedge maze.
    457693|00000000||Be waiting for you there.
    457695|00000000||Very well, but first you absolutely must try the Fiorano rosé. Absolutely!
    509547|00000000||Your mom sent us, Mr. Panther.
    509538|00000000||Your mom sent us, Mr. Panther.
    458845|00000000||Albert Vegelbud?
    458847|00000000||No, heheheh…
    509527|00000000||Heeheehee.
    509528|00000000||I'm a black panther. Rrraw!
    509537|00000000||Oh my, Count!
    458833|00000000||You Albert?
    458835|00000000||See ya.
    459038|00000000||Nice mask.
    509506|00000000||Nice mask.
    459040|00000000||Rrraaw!
   1003761|00000000||Heeheehee!
    458837|00000000||Yes?
    594810|00000000||Hey! Didn't you owe me a fiver?
    594812|00000000||Akh akh akh akh akh!
    594814|00000000||Why so glum? Shit your trousers?
    536733|00000000||Ah… Sir Bleeding Heart, here to pay me a visit. Good day.
    536734|00000000||We know each other?
    536735|00000000||No, thank the gods. Though we might've met had you helped me. But no, chose to wash your hands of the matter, abandoned me to thugs who assaulted me in a passageway.
    536736|00000000||Begone, already.
    421979|00000000||Excellent goods at the lowest prices! If some mug's got it cheaper, you can be sure the scoundrel puts sawdust in his flour!
    498349|00000000||Interest you in a fritter?
   1028769|00000000||Not so interested in goods, but I'd sure like to play some cards…
   1028768|00000000||I'd like to play cards.
    421987|00000000||Take care, now.
    421983|00000000||Farewell.
    421981|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    536746|00000000||I welcome my savior to my humble abode!
    536747|00000000||Huh?
    536748|00000000||You may not remember, sir, but I shall never forget. Two cutpurses tried to rob me, you stood in my defense.
    536749|00000000||Uh… That's right. Just gave them what they deserved.
    536750|00000000||And earned yourself a standing reduction in my shop.
   1037197|00000000||Over my dead body! You'll not swivel your arse in some brothel!
   1037199|00000000||It's not a brothel!
   1037201|00000000||No? This placard sure claims otherwise!
   1045980|00000000||I know full well what sort o' debauchery goes on in them dumps!
   1038343|00000000||Reaaally? I wonder how.
   1037203|00000000||Thought you'd give up this nonsense once I put a ring on your finger!
   1037205|00000000||And I thought you'd stop drinking with your mates.
   1037207|00000000||You get what you see!
   1037209|00000000||Took the words right out of my mouth!
   1037191|00000000||You know I'm a dancer!
   1037193|00000000||I thought you was just talkin'…
   1037195|00000000||Got dancers 'round every other corner in the big city.
   1038350|00000000||You pig!
   1015084|00000000||So we start in G-major and--
   1015085|00000000||Ugh. I've told you. The piece is sad, melancholy. It needs a minor key.
   1028487|00000000||But I wanted--
   1028489|00000000||To ruin everything. We'll start in E-minor.
   1020570|00000000||How fare ye?
   1020572|00000000||Akh akh…
   1020574|00000000||Begone.
   1023305|00000000||And you believe that?
   1020576|00000000||Not that… Not again… Please…
   1020578|00000000||No, no, no, noooo!
   1020580|00000000||That hurt.
   1023307|00000000||Vernon Roche already vexes the Black Ones… Got 'em scared shitless.
   1023309|00000000||All Temeria's abuzz about it.
   1034415|00000000||Radovid a bringer of freedom? Just another invader, as I see it, witcher.
   1020581|00000000||Shoulda stayed in the motherland, 'stead o' fleein' to foreign parts…
   1020590|00000000||A black Temeria's no Temeria at all.
   1020583|00000000||Greetings.
   1004705|00000000||Tell me what you found. Here's some coin.
   1004755|00000000||That hard-up for coin? Fine. Have some. Now talk. What'd you find on him?
   1013021|00000000||Oy, fuckin' hell! What was that for?
   1013023|00000000||For everything.
   1013017|00000000||[Hit him.]
   1013025|00000000||Get outta my sight. Now.
   1013018|00000000||Get outta my sight.
   1004757|00000000||Triflings, baubles. Glass-beaded ring, handful of coins… And a letter. Look. Vellum - quality parchment, that. I'll wipe off the writin' and sell it as new.
   1004763|00000000||That's human skin.
   1004765|00000000||"Priscilla." Next victim's name. If you'd given this to the right person she might not've been hurt.
   1004767|00000000||Hm-hm, what the fuck do I care what happens to some Pruhsilly? We short o' wenches in this town?
   1004709|00000000||Talk. What'd you find on him?
   1004753|00000000||Ayyye. As you wi-ish.
   1004704|00000000||What was in his pockets. Tell me.
   1004779|00000000||We'll meet again.
   1004781|00000000||Aye. When I load you into me wheelbarrow.
   1004707|00000000||I'll be back.
   1004706|00000000||I'd advise you not to piss me off.
   1004771|00000000||I'd advise you not to anger me. Or you'll get an inside tour of the crematory.
   1004773|00000000||Touch me, and the guards'll be hidin' your arse 'fore you count to three.
   1004775|00000000||To save a little shit like you? Doubt it.
   1004777|00000000||They's clever lads, more cleverer than you. They know Eustace, know they want me on their side. 'Cause you'll all die one day, and then I'll decide where your body winds up: a grave, the crematorium… or elsewhere.
    451309|00000000||What, you hard o' thinkin'? Won't tell you nothin', freak!
   1004693|00000000||You search Fabian's body?
   1004695|00000000||Well, aye. Cast an eye in his pockets, heh, made sure nothing went to waste.
   1004697|00000000||I call a spade a spade - you rob corpses.
   1004699|00000000||An' I call a prick a prick - it's none o' your fuckin' concern. What, are you a tax collector? Piss off, mutant!
   1004678|00000000||You searched him?
   1004679|00000000||Collected other bodies with those injuries?
   1004681|00000000||One of them? So there've been other bodies like that?
   1004683|00000000||Hm, sure have. Beggars, street urchins and street walkers. One wench so portly I hadda cut her into pieces to fit her in me wheelbarrow. "Slippery Sow," they called her on account o' the--
   1004685|00000000||Some things are best left unsaid. What happened to the pieces?
   1004687|00000000||Whaddaya mean? Reverend Nathaniel ordered 'em burned. Every last one. Oh, a shame that was.
   1004689|00000000||Shame? Why? Actually, never mind. Another thing that's best left unsaid.
   1004667|00000000||You Eustace? The corpse collector?
   1004669|00000000||Aye. How'd you know?
   1004671|00000000||Hff. Fourth sense, I think it is. You bring Fabian Meyer's body to the morgue?
   1004677|00000000||Fabian? Fabian? Oh yeah, I remember - hah! No eyes, no heart - one of them, right? No purse, neither, as I recall…
   1008556|00000000||Sod off. Don't know nothin' else.
   1006689|00000000||Amulets're emanating magic… Gotta be Triss'. She was allergic to potions.
    593763|00000000||You sure he betrayed you?
    593765|00000000||So maybe those men down below wound up here by accident.
    593827|00000000||Eat my own boot before I believe that.
    579104|00000000||This is between you and them.
    579107|00000000||This is between you and them. Not my problem, rather not get involved.
    579108|00000000||You got involved when you came here. We'll get rid of them quicker together.
    593855|00000000||Hrgh. Knew I shouldn't have come here…
    579102|00000000||We got a plan of attack?
    593857|00000000||Yeah. Improvise.
    579105|00000000||Lead the way.
    579103|00000000||Course, I'll help you.
    593760|00000000||Gotta get rid of them. Coming?
    593756|00000000||You've grown careless. Let yourself be drawn into a trap.
    593758|00000000||Nah. Only traps here are the ones I set.
    593754|00000000||Yeah, you got duped.
    574451|00000000||Don't look a bit like lost travelers.
    574452|00000000||They're not. Means Louis sold me out.
    593751|00000000||Louis?
    593753|00000000||Old friend, kinda. Did a few jobs together once, a while past. Louis recommended this place to me.
   1015470|00000000||My, my… nice work.
   1015471|00000000||They've a long way to go, yet…
   1015472|00000000||Straighten that line! Hanna, lift your knees! Higher! There you go!
   1054370|00000000||Dandelion must've dropped it on purpose… Knew I'd follow.
   1054372|00000000||Crumpled sheet. "…the day, my bloom, when you recall this heart you rent through cruel denial, words of doom…"
   1056576|00000000||Hm, must've broken his heart to part with that little ditty.
   1044040|00000000||Scent's familiar. Mhmmmm, "Nuits de Beauclair."
   1056574|00000000||Dandelion uses it by the bucket. Trail should be clear…
   1053573|00000000||Hullo, long-ears! You paid the tax?
   1053575|00000000||Tax? On what?
   1053577|00000000||On swine.
   1053579|00000000||But I've no animals with me…
   1053581|00000000||No. I'm talkin' about you. So pay, or go back to rut in the furrows.
   1000571|00000000||Albert! Why do you hide?
   1000573|00000000||Albert! There you are, my love!
   1000570|00000000||Albert! You promised to show me your laboratory!
   1052972|00000000||Here's the mill mentioned in that denunciation.
   1052974|00000000||We should search it.
   1052978|00000000||No need. We'll drag the peasant out, tell him he's to bring us the mage, or we'll set the mill on fire.
   1052980|00000000||What if it's false information? He'd lose his everything for nothing.
   1052982|00000000||Happens. Can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.
    470231|0d2919bb||Old Woman
    172235|00000000||Stop, thief!
    558312|00000000||Master! You goin' north perchance?
   1034951|00000000||And? D'you find anythin'?
   1076970|00000000||Oi, witcher! Find the key, release me! You won't regret it!
    466709|00000000||Beautifoo, pretty birdo.
    466711|00000000||Think so? Long as you're happy with it…
    466713|00000000||Mans good. No like othermans. Thank yous.
    466703|00000000||Good no birdo. Ugooly.
    466705|00000000||No. Actually, it's not bad, not bad at all.
    466707|00000000||Mans kind, but birdo ugooly. Trollololo see, trollolo see ugooly.
   1027248|00000000||Hm, fits perfectly.
    491015|00000000||Eh, look, a blonde feller's wandered in.
    491016|00000000||Oy, mate. Bein' honest - I dunno that there's any room in here for you.
    594616|00000000||Greetings.
    594618|00000000||No two ways about it.
    594620|00000000||Uh-oh. Think that peasecod was overripe.
    531471|00000000||You play gwent?
    531472|00000000||They say Haddy's dim, but that just ain't true. Haddy don't know how to plow or sow, nor catch no fishes. But he can sure play cards.
    534065|00000000||So, aye, Haddy plays gwent.
    531479|00000000||So let's play.
    531477|00000000||So let's play.
    531480|00000000||We'll play another time.
    531478|00000000||Changed my mind.
    531475|00000000||Would Haddy like to play a round of gwent?
    531476|00000000||Course he would.
    531481|00000000||Haddy done lost - it happens. Take your prize.
    531470|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    531487|00000000||'Addy's not clever, nay. Finds no mushrooms save his own stinkhorn. But! But! But! 'Addy can sure play cards!
   1042289|00000000||Know who else might be worth playing?
   1042291|00000000||Haddy heard the hermit gabbin' to hisself. Old goat said Zoltan Chivay and Crach an Craite got rare cards. But who they are, Haddy don't know.
    543696|c80df7f6||Townsman
    595808|00000000||Seen but a few good swords in my life - all Éibhear Hattori's.
    595810|00000000||Ploughin' dough-kneader... He'd do better to make some blades.
    595809|00000000||Dumplings? He's fucked in the head, must be.
    595807|00000000||Why in bloody hell would he give up swordsmithin'?
    335040|00000000||Geralt? Are you on the isle yet? Does the xenovox work? Can you hear me?
    335046|00000000||What? I can't hear… Great, broke already. Sheesh. Short-lived, this magic…
    335048|00000000||What did you say? There's some interference… You must be very careful.
   1054355|00000000||Hey, witcher, monster slayin' - ye get good coin for it?
   1034137|cfe4cfd3||Patient
   1073112|00000000||Ye drove the bandits off, saved us a good lot of grief. We'll not forget!
   1073110|00000000||Thank you, thank you, master!
   1073116|00000000||Is it bandits you witchers work for now?
   1073387|00000000||Get outta here! Piss off, now!
   1073114|00000000||Why? Why'd ye do it? To let them give us grief!
   1011302|00000000||Greetings.
   1011304|00000000||Welcome.
   1011298|00000000||Are you nuts?
   1011296|00000000||Dammit!
   1011292|00000000||{Ekh ekh…}
    580018|d00dc371||Dockhand
   1032611|00000000||Look. See 'em, hangin' from that branch? A lady's knickers!
   1032613|00000000||Always get that after a ball. Highfalutin' lords and ladies, and yet they plough away in the bushes like rabbits.
   1032615|00000000||Last time I even saw this elegant couple neckin' in the fountain. Can you imagine?
   1032617|00000000||In the fountain? I drink that water!
    469499|00000000||Nooo! Stop! Don't harm him!
    592716|00000000||What's going on?
    592725|00000000||Think we need to talk…
    592821|00000000||What're you saying?
    592825|00000000||Not till I find out what's going on here.
    552021|00000000||You won't kill anyone. Ever again.
    552022|00000000||Ggggrrr!
   1002273|00000000||No! Don't hurt him!
    552023|00000000||Get out of here. Before I change my mind.
    593059|00000000||Run!
    552008|00000000||Can't let you do that.
   1076281|00000000||Told you I'd kill you.
   1076283|00000000||I knows well what you said. Do it.
   1076285|00000000||If you want death, find some reins and a tree with a strong limb.
   1077088|00000000||Wouldn't work. Couldn't do it. Always been a coward. Do it, please.
    593124|00000000||This is between the two of you. I refuse to meddle. But cross my path again, and I will kill you.
    593127|00000000||Nooo! Mercy!
    552010|00000000||You had no mercy for your sister. I'll have none for you. Aaarrrggghh!
    552009|00000000||She deserves it. Do what you will.
    592827|00000000||I love him, always have. Even after I'd learned his secret.
   1002249|00000000||You… you knew? Did you know I shut meself in here to wait out me change?
   1002251|00000000||I knew and I didn't mind. But you chose Hanna.
   1002261|00000000||I wanted her to see you. I wanted her to fear you. She'd not have stayed. And we could be together…
   1002255|00000000||You brought her here… that night. 'Twas the reason I had the taste of blood in me mouth come morn.
   1002257|00000000||I did it for us! She was to see you turn, naught more! I didn't want her death, you've got to believe me!
    592835|00000000||I don't. And I'll kill you willingly. First time for that, in fact.
    592823|00000000||What is this nonsense?
    592820|00000000||You're raving, woman.
    592726|00000000||It's Niellen!
    592817|00000000||Lycanthropy can afflict anyone. But it is a curse, so sorry, but I have to--
    592819|00000000||You don't understand! I love him! He was near to bein' mine, till you came along! Go away, leave us be!
    592718|00000000||You insane?! Stand back! He's dangerous!
    592720|00000000||Not to me, he's not.
    592715|00000000||Are you crazy? Move!
   1055622|00000000||Nooo! Stop! Don't harm him!
   1055908|00000000||I changed my mind.
   1055910|00000000||Leave him be!
   1068316|00000000||His unit was ambushed. They fought bravely, but…
   1068319|00000000||So he perished a hero… Just as his father before him.
   1068321|00000000||I wish to lay his body in the family crypt. At home…
   1068323|00000000||Afraid that won't be possible. He was killed in the swamp…
   1068325|00000000||I cannot even do this for him…? He is to lay in a foreign land?
   1068327|00000000||Though… not for long. This will be Nilfgaard soon. My son did not die in vain.
   1068329|00000000||I thank you for all you have done. Your payment.
   1068331|00000000||Farewell.
   1068313|00000000||Died in battle.
   1068333|00000000||He deserted. Was caught, then hanged.
   1068336|00000000||Lies!
   1068338|00000000||Found him hanging next to others. Notice posted on the tree was clear…
   1068340|00000000||I do not believe you. My son was no coward.
   1068342|00000000||Believe what you will. Found a letter on him. Addressed to you.
   1068345|00000000||Mother, This may well be the last time I write. In all my letters, I have lied. Forgive me. I am no hero. I take no pleasure in killing Nordlings.
   1068347|00000000||This place is a nightmare. I have borne it until now, I can bear it no longer. Not long past, they ordered us to murder prisoners. Do you know what this means - to kill defenseless men?
   1068349|00000000||I must flee this place…
   1068352|00000000||My darling child, forever… you have found him for me. Your payment, take it.
   1068314|00000000||Deserted. Was caught.
   1068303|00000000||My son - were you able to learn anything?
   1068305|00000000||I was…
   1068307|00000000||I wish to know the truth… Be it sweet, be it painful, I wish to know.
   1068309|00000000||Your son is dead.
   1068312|00000000||How did it happen…?
    575712|00000000||Tra la la la. La.
    575710|00000000||Shhh! Shush! 'Twill all be fine. 'Twill all be fine. Shhh! Shush!
    575696|00000000||Brrr.
    575700|00000000||Lickety-split, clean and fit!
    575702|00000000||Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
    575698|00000000||Sod off.
    575704|00000000||Owwww!
    575706|00000000||Nooooo! *Cough cough* Nooooo! *Cough cough*
    575708|00000000||Oooeeeeee! Aaaah!
   1004804|00000000||There 'gainst the dark stormy sky…
   1004805|00000000||Death, the severe master, will invite you to dance…
   1004806|00000000||You'll dance in a row, away from the dawn towards the dark lands…
   1004807|00000000||Rain will wash the tears turned salt from your cheeks.
    505165|00000000||Iron Mortimer, captain of the Temple Guard, stands ready to fight!
    505166|00000000||Have we found the captain another victim?
    476139|00000000||Cap'n? No clue. Drinkin' somewheres, I reckon. Like always.
    416200|00000000||Found you. Every last one.
    416202|00000000||But you found me last!
    417335|00000000||Let's go back the cottage. Can we tell 'em I let you find me?
    453505|00000000||Peasants didn't come here to ask nicely.
   1053717|00000000||Do you know the Rosemary and Thyme? Well they've turned it into a cabaret.
   1053719|00000000||Oh, Vincent, you know me. Theater, opera - count me in. But a cabaret? I'm simply not fond of such common men's diversions.
   1053721|00000000||Common women - you're fond of them. And I tell you, some fetching specimens to feast your eyes on there.
    572325|00000000||Melitele, All-Mother, deliver us from evil, save us…
    572326|00000000||Fool woman.
    579518|00000000||Something the matter?
    579520|00000000||Don't you understand? They burn us for those gods. It's religion makes them do it.
    579522|00000000||They burn us out of hatred. And fear. The Holy Fire's but an excuse.
    579524|00000000||Then pray away, Melitele's sure to help, huh.
   1051751|00000000||Phew, reeks in here…
   1051753|00000000||That stench - ripe cheese. Seems Aeramas was a tyromancer.
   1051755|00000000||My Trial of the Cheeses… Vesemir'll get a kick out this when I tell him.
   1053459|00000000||Not sure this can get any worse…
   1051978|00000000||Akh kha akh…
   1051980|00000000||What'd he make this cheese out of? Nekker milk?!
   1053461|00000000||Need to be careful.
   1052015|00000000||House is completely destroyed, but the magic circle's intact.
   1052019|00000000||Guessing this is a locked portal. Need to find the key.
   1052017|00000000||Looks to me like a locked portal.
   1053463|00000000||Wonder if I can open it using one of Aeramas' items…
   1053150|00000000||Damage looks fresh. Wonder what happened?
   1053152|00000000||Some kind of vault. I should look around.
   1053154|00000000||Magic barrier's still active. Gotta find a way to turn it off.
   1053156|00000000||Gotta share this discovery with Lambert - foglets are immune to the smell of old cheese.
   1053158|00000000||If this sword is as deadly as Aeramas' cheeses, it's worth taking.
   1053465|00000000||Maybe I'll name it "The Emmentaler."
   1053160|00000000||Deactivated the barrier.
   1053162|00000000||Fresh air. Finally.
    462860|00000000||Aeramas' residence, must be. Let's see what's inside.
    504772|00000000||Name's Geralt.
    504773|00000000||Patty Gruber. I'm a bookie. I trust you're here to fight.
    504795|00000000||I'm ready.
    504796|00000000||Hear that?! A fight at last! Our champion, Archibald O'Neill, to face Geralt!
    542209|00000000||Fight!
    542210|00000000||I'm ready.
    542214|00000000||Fight!
    504774|00000000||I'm ready to fight.
    504781|00000000||Think I'll fight some other time.
    504776|00000000||See you.
    504775|00000000||Tell me about the fights.
    504789|00000000||What can you tell me about these fights?
    542207|00000000||Bouts are held in Novigrad, the Skellige Isles, and in Velen. Each region has its champion. But to face the said champion, you must first defeat three other contenders in that region.
    504794|00000000||Defeat the champions of Velen, Skellige and Novigrad, and you'll win the prestigious title of Champion of Champions.
    541339|00000000||I wanna face O'Neill again.
    541341|00000000||Excellent.
   1068232|00000000||You're late. Very. Ves is dead and buried.
   1068226|00000000||Roche, I--
   1068228|00000000||I've no desire to talk to you, Geralt. Goodbye.
   1068230|00000000||Where the bloody hell did you go?! Berry picking?!
   1053127|00000000||Perty!
   1053125|00000000||Fight good!
   1053123|00000000||Hah!
   1053140|00000000||Troll'th caaalled…
   1053142|00000000||Athak Akydalv…
   1070993|00000000||This way. Upstairs.
   1003009|00000000||Whose grave is it - what do you think? No inscription, sadly.
   1003036|00000000||Hm… Sign of the gull. If I didn't already know where she was buried, I'd guess this is Lara Dorren's sepulcher.
   1003038|00000000||Perhaps it's a monument to her?
   1003079|00000000||Can't see the elves commemorating her this way. Heroine of a tragic legend to some, but…
   1003091|00000000||Most see her as a traitor to her race, who got her just deserts for marrying Cregennan of Lod.
   1003093|00000000||Perhaps the elven mage is Lara's kin. It would explain why he's helping Ciri.
   1003102|00000000||Possible.
   1029948|00000000||This what you're looking for?
   1029195|00000000||Ahah!
   1029953|00000000||So what's it supposed to do?
   1029955|00000000||Hm, I hope I'll be able to activate it… Let's leave this place, shall we?
   1088434|00000000||Yeah.
   1088436|00000000||Heh, heh, heh heh, heeeh.
   1088438|00000000||Ah, horrible times!
   1088440|00000000||People! An affray!
    470428|00000000||At last…
    477205|00000000||Will ye forgive me?
    477207|00000000||Already have.
    447549|00000000||Thanks for helping.
    447551|00000000||No need to thank me. Really.
    447553|00000000||No, there is. You don't know how much it means… to have someone you can rely on in this fucking city.
    465198|00000000||It's all right. It'll be over soon.
    455721|00000000||Mhm. Soon.
    472848|00000000||Refuse to chase down some goat.
    472864|00000000||Can't seriously think I'm gonna chase down your goat.
    472868|00000000||A pellar without a goat makes for a mute prophet.
   1049386|00000000||Witcher! Will ye find my Princess? The pellar will prophesy soon as she returns.
   1049387|00000000||You win. I'll find her.
   1049388|00000000||Couldn't care less about your goat.
   1049407|00000000||Forget it. Not about to run around looking for a goat.
    472883|00000000||No Princess, no prophecy, no augury.
    472881|00000000||Getting on my nerves, old man. I'm not going anywhere.
    472872|00000000||You're getting annoying.
    472874|00000000||Fine. I'll find her.
    472857|00000000||The bell! The little bell's ringing - she loves it! Ring, ring, and she will follow! Uh, for a while.
    472859|00000000||But beware of wild strawberries. Raspberries, too.
    472862|00000000||Yeah, treacherous as beasts go. I always keep an eye out for 'em.
    472855|00000000||Fine. I'll get your goat.
    472876|00000000||Huh, will you help me if I bring the goat back?
    472879|00000000||Princess, Princess, where've you got to, girl?
    472846|00000000||If I find your goat, will you help?
    472610|00000000||Anna and her daughter are missing. Know where they are?
    475777|00000000||Nay, no, nay. Pellar don't know.
    475779|00000000||But the spirits could know. The pellar will augur, the spirits ask.
   1058004|00000000||Spirits, great, fine with me. Long as I know where to look, where to find them.
    472612|00000000||Lost, lost… must be found… Princess! None better than Princess for findin' things.
    472614|00000000||Princess? Which princess?
    472616|00000000||Princess! My goat! She's fled!
    472844|00000000||Those men must've scared her off. Can we get back to the auguring?
    472618|00000000||Without the goat? Impossible. No goat? Hmph, won't work!
    472820|00000000||I'm looking for Anna. And her daughter.
    472835|00000000||You make the amulet?
    472837|00000000||Aye. Sure, 'twas the pellar. After the way of his forefathers, over still water, in the light of a full moon.
    472841|00000000||Proper as amulets go. It protected well. Should never 'ave taken it off.
    472818|00000000||You make it?
    472816|00000000||Protect? From what?
    472824|00000000||So, designed to protect her. From what?
    472827|00000000||Oh, the dear - besieged, she was. Evil all around, wanting to possess her.
    472831|00000000||Old magic born of oblivion, from dark sources emerged.
    473053|00000000||Old magic? Can you be more specific?
    473055|00000000||Tis naught for mouth-speech, nor for the touch. A small protective charm - not a thing more a pellar could do.
    472808|00000000||Recognize this?
    475745|00000000||Made of spruce wood, strong smell of juniper. Designed to protect someone.
    472810|00000000||Freshly cut spruce sprinkled with goat's blood, then tempered with an incense of earthsmoke and juniper. For Anna. To protect her.
    472799|00000000||Need your help.
    472797|00000000||Expecting me?
    472801|00000000||You were expecting me?
    472803|00000000||Aye, as the bones declared I should.
    472805|00000000||"They shall come whose stench is rape and death, but the wolf shall disperse them. The White Wolf."
    473400|00000000||And thus he comes. Omens never lie.
    472594|00000000||Hey! Anybody home?
    472596|00000000||Open up. It's safe now.
    472598|00000000||Devils! Who do they bring?! What seek ye?
    475734|00000000||I need your help.
    472793|00000000||Ooh… a man - nay - a wolf, gray, though not old… 'Tis he the pellar awaits.
    472905|00000000||Let's do this.
    472907|00000000||Can we talk about Anna and Tamara now? Know where they might be?
    473394|00000000||Whatever I do, I gotta find the botchling first.
    473396|00000000||Seek it at midnight, near the grave that lies empty.
    473398|00000000||If what you say is true, the baron oughta know where that grave is.
    473374|00000000||I need to know where the botchling is.
    473344|00000000||Heard of one witcher who lifted a botchling's curse. Never tried it myself, though.
    473346|00000000||I know you need to bury it under the threshold.
    473366|00000000||And give it a name! Perform the Aymm Rhoin.
    473368|00000000||The Ritual of Naming? That's an elven custom.
    473370|00000000||Human, elven, dwarven… ancient. Spirits have no race, they honor not its meaning.
    473372|00000000||Win a spirit's favor, and the spirit shall aid you. Ask and it will answer. Seek, and it will show you the way.
    473316|00000000||How can I lift the curse?
    477741|00000000||I hear you right? You mention Forefathers' Eve?
    477744|00000000||Pretty old custom. Thought it had died out.
    477746|00000000||Death lurks in every bog and puddle 'round here. Folk know they could die, their earthly matters unresolved.
    477747|00000000||Then they require help, or they'll not know peace. Forefathers' Eve must be performed.
    477745|00000000||Light the tallow candles to lead them through the dark, call them by name, appease their regrets - only then may they depart in peace.
    477740|00000000||You mention Forefathers' Eve?
    473314|00000000||Why do you need its blood?
    473318|00000000||Why do you want its blood?
    473320|00000000||Blood, blood, blood! It binds men for all ages - the living and the dead.
    473326|00000000||Sure, but what do you wanna do with it?
    473328|00000000||Atimes, a century's too short for two brothers to reconcile. One dies before things are set right. The other then brings his blood to the pellar.
    473340|00000000||Mhm. And what does the pellar do?
    473342|00000000||He awaits Forefathers' Eve. He mixes the blood with milk, herbs and hens' feet. He drinks - to reconcile the dead with the living.
    477739|00000000||There shall be no Forefathers' Eve this year… but we'll find a way, all the same.
    473012|00000000||What happened to the child?
    473014|00000000||In a grave thrown, without rite or ceremony, it awoke. Now it wanders, it seeks vengeance.
    473016|00000000||A botchling.
    473018|00000000||White Wolf, wise wolf. Catch the botchling, the botchling will help, lead the wolf to the loved ones.
    473059|00000000||Botchlings suck the blood of pregnant women and eat their fetuses. They don't help.
    473078|00000000||Tis a being cursed, and witchers lift curses. If the White Wolf can't lift it, he should bring me its blood. Blood will always find kindred blood.
    473006|00000000||The child - what happened to it?
    473024|00000000||The baron have anything to do with his wife's miscarriage?
    473028|00000000||Foul-tempered he is, and he's a fondness for hooch.
    473031|00000000||No doubt makes his temper even fouler.
    473041|00000000||Did he abuse his family? Anna came to you, you must've noticed something.
    473043|00000000||The pellar's old, near blind… but Princess came and licked her hand.
    473407|00000000||So what?
    473312|00000000||She's a wise beast, only comes to those who suffer.
    473002|00000000||Baron have anything to do with this?
    473080|00000000||You know all this how?
    473082|00000000||Anna tell you all this? Did she come here after it happened?
    473084|00000000||Nay, not Anna. 'Twas the omens told me.
    473088|00000000||Great, so I can be sure it's true.
    473090|00000000||The omens need not your faith to be true, it is you who needs the omens to lead you to truth.
    475816|00000000||Mentioned a child. Whose?
    475822|00000000||Why, Anna's.
    472982|00000000||Anna was pregnant?
    472984|00000000||She was. And she miscarried.
    473020|00000000||Hm, baron didn't mention it.
    473022|00000000||Afraid, perhaps, or ashamed, or forgetful… Or perhaps he had no wish to remember.
    472945|00000000||You spoke of a child. Whose?
    472960|00000000||Not enough, I need to know more.
    472974|00000000||It's over? Is that it?
    475810|00000000||That is it.
    475812|00000000||Spirits had nothing more to say? Like, where they went, or where they are now?
    472980|00000000||You came for an augury, and augur I did. They're gone. The child remains.
    472632|00000000||Will this do?
    472891|00000000||They are not here. They have gone.
    475795|00000000||Blood! I see blood!
    472897|00000000||Whose?
    472927|00000000||No Anna… no Tamara… just a child.
    475805|00000000||A child that lives not, yet did not die.
    477736|00000000||Blood! We need blood. A living being.
   1058002|00000000||Fine. Be right back.
    472909|00000000||Happy for you, but I'm kinda in a hurry.
    475793|00000000||Anna and Tamara? They might be in danger.
    472911|00000000||The White Wolf helped the pellar, and so the pellar shall help him!
    472903|00000000||Will you help me now?
    472901|00000000||Goat of mine! Dearest, sweetest goat!
    472626|00000000||Nowhere in sight, nowhere to be found.
    472885|00000000||Why, not even a White Wolf can make up for a missing goat.
   1045773|00000000||Princess! Flee not from the pellar, for there are wolves about!
   1040667|00000000||Look! The elf left another message for Ciri!
   1029254|00000000||Oh, changed your mind, have you?
   1029140|00000000||Hm, really works.
    557575|00000000||Why'd we even come…
    557571|00000000||He must've left it somewhere here…
    557576|00000000||All right, let's watch this message.
    557606|00000000||We're certain to find something here.
    594424|00000000||Zireael, this place is no longer safe. Do not tarry here long.
    594425|00000000||Trust no one, and above all beware the witches of Crookback Bog.
    595342|00000000||Try to reach the place where last we were together.
   1038620|00000000||"Where last we were together." Not much to go on.
   1041572|00000000||Dammit!
   1041578|00000000||Perhaps it's best he didn't leave a clearer message. The Wild Hunt broke in here, surely they saw the projection.
    595363|00000000||They searched everything… and if they had more time, they'd probably have torn the place to the ground.
   1041579|00000000||But that doesn't change the fact that we haven't learned anything - not about the elf, not about Ciri.
    595368|00000000||Well, we know they were well acquainted, and traveling together.
    568165|00000000||Wonder why they split up.
    568167|00000000||Wonder why they split up.
    568169|00000000||Perhaps because the Wild Hunt was on the elf's trail, and Ciri would be safer if they did.
    498436|00000000||Elf warned Ciri about some witches.
   1002787|00000000||How do I find them?
   1002789|00000000||The swamps are vast, dangerous, but they say the Crones mark the way for peasants who wish to visit them. The manuscript mentions a chapel in Crookback Bog. And from that chapel one must follow a Trail of Treats.
   1002791|00000000||Treats?
   1002792|00000000||Of course, they didn't read you bedtime stories at Kaer Morhen. All normal folk know that witches live in gingerbread houses poised atop chicken legs.
   1002795|00000000||I'll have to see that to believe it.
   1058915|00000000||Take the tome and read it. I… I truly do believe you'll find your Cirilla.
   1040347|00000000||All right, then. As a start, let's look for a way out of here.
   1041931|00000000||Good idea.
   1002784|00000000||How do I find the witches?
   1002721|00000000||You know these witches?
   1002734|00000000||I've never met them, but I've read of them. In an old manuscript I found in one of the huts in the village.
   1002758|00000000||It mentions the village witches venturing into Crookback Bog at times - to liaise between the villagers and the Crones, the Ladies of the Wood.
   1002760|00000000||The Crones appear to be intolerant of outsiders, but they help the local folk. Apparently, they stopped the spread of the plague in Velen.
   1002769|00000000||Hm. What's your take on this?
   1002771|00000000||I'd love to shrug it off as the nattering of so many old women, yet…
   1002773|00000000||Throughout my first fortnight in Velen, I had horrible nightmares. Something was calling me out into the swamps.
   1002775|00000000||One night I decided to enter the dream consciously, render it lucid. I confronted the… thing directly. It broke contact at once. Peaceful nights ever since.
   1002694|00000000||Do you know these witches?
   1002695|00000000||Didn't mention them earlier. Why?
   1002702|00000000||Why didn't you say anything earlier? I told you Ciri had a run in with a witch.
   1002704|00000000||I had no idea you meant them… If I'd told you something, you would have rushed off to find them…
   1002709|00000000||But we needed first to confirm that Ciri was here, didn't we?
   1002715|00000000||I shall tell you everything now, of course.
   1002717|00000000||Now, after I safely led you through the cave?
   1002719|00000000||I can't believe you'd think so poorly of me. Perhaps you do bear a grudge against sorceresses.
   1002729|00000000||Mhm. Can't imagine where that comes from.
    498442|00000000||The witches of Crookback Swamp…
    498443|00000000||Crookback Bog.
    498446|00000000||Keira! If you're hiding something…
   1002693|00000000||But - I didn't say…
   1029310|00000000||You were supposed to help me! Geralt!
   1040686|00000000||Gotta activate the projection.
   1040339|00000000||All right, where's that swallow?
    346772|e188de39||Vegelbuds' Porter
    481442|00000000||And how can I be sure you won't try anything?
    485008|00000000||I'll go with you. Not like I really have a choice now, do I?
    485010|00000000||And there'll be no trickery along the way? I could wring your neck like a fat hen's, you realize…
    485011|00000000||Yes, but I also realize you won't. My corpse is worth nothing to you, whereas alive…! Like I said - a hundred gold ingots.
    485016|00000000||One hundred gold ingots - no more, no less, or I'm not Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove!
    485048|00000000||Viscount? Come on, everybody calls you Dandelion…
    485050|00000000||That, my friend, is what we call an assumed identity. Can't expect me to reveal my full title to every goitered idiot I run across.
    485054|00000000||Now, if you could just unbind…
    501457|00000000||Sit there. There, I said! And shut it!
    501458|00000000||All right, all right. But what then? How long do you think you can keep me in this hut?
    526540|00000000||Quiet!
    526542|00000000||Don't worry about me, I'll be quiet. But those halflings? You can't trust them, you know…
    526544|00000000||Once I saw one of them… Ouch!
    499014|00000000||Need the key.
    499077|00000000||Morkvarg broke through this door. Must've smelled something beyond it.
    499098|00000000||Something strapped to his belt… Keys. Might come in handy.
    499097|00000000||Some daredevil, came to challenge Morkvarg… Been here for years.
    499763|00000000||Wolf-- no, werewolf leg. Chewed off…
    501153|00000000||Morkvarg? Behind this wall, sounds like.
    509826|00000000||Skull on a stick. Interesting decor.
    505354|00000000||Ideal friend. Patient, doesn't mouth-off…
    505355|00000000||Hm, cozy…
    506321|00000000||Draft from below. A cave?
    507142|00000000||Air's moving here… Must be another cave above, or a way out.
    507143|00000000||Bones fell through the crevice… years ago.
    509827|00000000||Untouched, no sign of feeding… Morkvarg doesn't devour his victims. Strange.
   1056833|00000000||Symbol of Freya.
    543892|00000000||Take care of yourselves, now.
    543893|00000000||Meaning? What would you have me do? Never leave my home? Step off the pavement to let a human pass?
    545137|00000000||Farewell.
    543884|00000000||Be careful, and farewell.
    543883|00000000||Get out of Novigrad if I were you.
    543890|00000000||I'd leave Novigrad if I were you.
    543891|00000000||How about that. Nonhumans bother you as well?
    545126|00000000||Me? No… The Eternal Fire, yes… They've got other scapegoats to burn right now, but it won't belong before they come for you.
    545130|00000000||I don't believe they will. They'd not dare go that far.
    545132|00000000||I was in Rivia in 1268 - during the massacre. Know exactly what I'm talking about.
    543885|00000000||Thank you, vatt'ghern. If you hadn't intervened, they'd have snipped my ears, like they did Faelar's… Or worse.
    560052|683bdeef||Witch Hunter Officer
    523534|00000000||Hmm… Wonder what this is.
    523327|00000000||Damn. Hunters got here first.
    523326|00000000||Long dead…
   1002893|00000000||He's not been seen around town in some time.
   1002895|00000000||Word is he's made some enemies. Turned to Joel, finally. Must've thought he'd get a second chance.
   1002487|00000000||Ha, ha, ha!
    462123|00000000||Here about the notice. Got monster trouble?
    462125|00000000||"Trouble"… Good one. We're not having trouble. We're up shit fucking creek.
    462129|00000000||Some shaggy fuck-knows-what's sitting in the woods, attacking every ploughin' transport that dares take the highroad. We're near outta bolts, arrows, rations - all around fucked. Sent a patrol out… blokes never came back.
    462131|00000000||So the job's simple. Bring me the fucker's head, and I'll give you gold - as much as the notice says. I'm not gonna haggle, quartermaster won't budge… But I can throw in a pass that'll get you across the Pontar. So? Deal?
   1051068|00000000||Sounds fair… See what I can do.
    462119|00000000||Here about the notice.
   1014182|00000000||Know what - nothing. So long.
    462121|00000000||Nothing. See ya.
    462117|00000000||Huh? What do you want?
    377238|00000000||The thug Dijkstra hired.
    495877|00000000||Watch out!
    495876|00000000||Aaa! Aaa!
   1025182|00000000||Half the price?! Are you daft? She's the sprightliest heifer north of the Pontar!
   1025184|00000000||Sprightly? Her udders scrape the ground!
   1025186|00000000||Sagging udders? No, that's your wife you're thinking about.
   1025188|00000000||What did you say?!
   1025190|00000000||I demand satisfaction! Immediately!
   1025192|00000000||Again, it's your wife who must help you there. Heifer, who wants a heifer?!
    594658|00000000||Mug like a puss…
    594660|00000000||Somethin' slimy 'bout you, to my mind.
    594662|00000000||That 'un's a rat for sure.
    380923|00000000||Here it is. Oh, dammit! Jammed again.
   1068832|00000000||Thanks for your help, Geralt.
   1068834|00000000||Don't mention it.
   1045820|00000000||That should do it. I'm going. You should too.
   1045822|00000000||Mhm. Not about to use the teleport, though. See you, Triss.
    485610|00000000||Got 'er right where we want 'er! Ready! Wait for it… Wait… Now!
   1032801|00000000||Good folk of Novigrad! Be not afraid!
   1032803|00000000||For fear is our greatest foe!
   1032805|00000000||Uncertain times are upon us! Only truth faith can provide salvation!
   1032807|00000000||Let us make offerings to the Eternal Fire! Let us pay tribute to the Flame of Life, for only it can save us!
   1067731|00000000||This is no time for chatter!
    515024|00000000||What happened here? Some sort of blasted vendetta?
    515025|00000000||M-m-m'lord… we'd 'ave never thought…
    515026|00000000||Speak, dammit!
    515027|00000000||The B-b-black B-beauty come th-through…
    515028|00000000||Witch hunters? They hanged two, you say?
    515064|00000000||Y-y-yes, m'lord. For w-w-w-witchcraft and com-com-communin' with the C-crones. But we 'ere 'ave never--
    515072|00000000||Yes, you lot ne'er do anything! I know you. They leave a while ago, the hunters?
    519422|00000000||Not-- Not so long past.
    420952|7643aa11||Servant
   1011223|00000000||Fucking mud.
   1011247|00000000||What now?
   1011243|00000000||Aaaah!
   1011241|00000000||Had enough?
   1011239|00000000||I'll make you weep.
   1020534|00000000||"Moribundia: The Vampire's Last Likeness."
   1020535|00000000||"Tyromancy, or the Noble Art of Cheese Divination."
   1020536|00000000||"The Merry Adventures of Muriel the Lovely Harlot, Adorned with Humorous Engravings."
   1020538|00000000||"My Manifesto". Must be it… There's a letter inside.
   1020537|00000000||"The Treatment of Furuncles Through Cauterization: A Study."
    381742|00000000||Mhehe. A child of the Elder Blood!
   1059018|00000000||Hehehe. He follows you, treads in your very tracks.
   1054294|00000000||Bravo, witcher! I've material for another ballad!
    560367|00000000||Big, really big…
    560373|00000000||Left a lot of fur when it rubbed against the trunk. Scent's still there.
    560384|00000000||Gotta find another way.
    560413|00000000||Died recently. Wonder what killed it.
    560416|00000000||Paw prints… Fight lasted a while.
    560422|00000000||Second set of tracks. It's either a huge fiend or…
    560445|00000000||Tufts of blood-caked fur… Second beast was a different color.
    560446|00000000||A chort - it's gotta be. Probably competed for territory with the fiend.
    560449|00000000||Hmm, have to lure him here somehow.
    560453|00000000||Too bad the dung's not fresh… but it oughta still work for a lure.
    560459|00000000||It'll smell this five miles away.
    560458|00000000||Done. Oughta attract the chort's attention.
    560471|00000000||Beast's sure to show. Just gotta wait in the cave.
    560608|00000000||Both lost loads of blood.
    560363|00000000||Monster wiped out the whole pack.
   1056869|00000000||This deck's to shine like the silver on the emperor's table!
    593938|00000000||Right, gimme the coin.
    593940|00000000||Tails, we clean the shit out of the stable. Heads, we go grab some tit.
    593942|00000000||One toss? You daft?
    593944|00000000||Course not. We keep tossin' till we get what we want.
   1003625|00000000||Muehehehe!
    581235|00000000||We dealt with the monster at the docks. Here for our reward.
    584448|00000000||Witchers? Since when do you travel in pairs?
    584450|00000000||Lot of dangers lie in wait for a lone witcher. Bandits, for example.
    581236|00000000||I advise you to change your tone.
    581237|00000000||Where's Jad Karadin? Talk!
   1004359|00000000||Lambert. Calm down.
   1004353|00000000||Lambert, calm down.
   1004352|00000000||Jad Karadin?
   1004355|00000000||Who?
   1039189|00000000||Trust me, Geralt, this is important. There's something I gotta know.
   1004363|00000000||I do not know any Karadin. Take your coin for the before and bugger off. Before I lose my temper!
   1004365|00000000||Where's Jad Karadin? Asking you for the last time!
   1004369|00000000||Guards! To the dungeon with them!
    478311|ce75940e||Thug
   1052142|00000000||So you don't know what happened in Downwarren?
   1052144|00000000||Somethin' happen there?
   1052146|00000000||Aye, a dark delusion gripped 'em! Madness! Parents murderin' young'uns, young'uns slayin' parents, blood everywhere!
   1052148|00000000||Gods! It's as it was in the prophecies. World's comin' to an end…
    416194|00000000||No one left hiding.
    416196|00000000||You're a wizard, right? Gonna show us some tricks when we get to the cottage?
    417333|00000000||No. We'll talk about your promise.
    484154|00000000||Your sword is mine!
    487023|00000000||That'll be the day!
    484153|00000000||Want that horse, don't you?!
    487030|00000000||Had one just like it!
   1021004|00000000||Huh. What are you doing here?
   1021005|00000000||Ah, witcher, greetings. I want to sign on a ship.
   1021006|00000000||Done looking for a way to be with Irma?
   1021007|00000000||Not at all. My search is what brought me to Novigrad. Access to culture, you see. But I also need to earn me bread, hence the ship.
   1021008|00000000||I get it. Good luck to you.
   1027519|00000000||Thanks, and to you. Well, I should go. So long, witcher!
   1002153|00000000||Jackasses, blasted whoresons all.
   1015973|00000000||Scum sail in from across the sea, think they can do what they please.
   1036896|00000000||Help me, witcher. Take pity.
    469956|00000000||Greetings, m'lord, m'lady.
    421468|00000000||We're Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's guests.
    421470|00000000||Your invitation, please.
    421474|00000000||All's in order. You'll find Lady Vegelbud in the estate's yard. Look for the parrot mask.
   1000512|00000000||One more thing - leave your swords here, please.
   1000516|00000000||Fine.
   1000514|00000000||Fine.
   1000513|00000000||Think there's been a mistake…
   1000520|00000000||Must be some mistake. You know why we're here, don’t you?
   1000526|00000000||Of course. But I've orders to make certain every guest enters the estate unarmed.
   1000528|00000000||Dammit…
   1000518|00000000||A pleasant evening to you both.
    575732|00000000||Rain's fuckin' with me knee.
    575734|00000000||Ye be hale and hearty, now!
    575740|00000000||Need somethin' tinkered? Or tempered, mayhaps?
    575717|00000000||Three years. Three years an apprentice, and he can't even 'old a hammer.
    575719|00000000||Blockhead. Talentless fuck.
    575736|00000000||Hark ye, who've we here?!
    575738|00000000||Got somethin' needs a hammerin'?
    575748|00000000||*Spit* Work an' more work!
    575742|00000000||Hey!
    575744|00000000||Don't stir the wolf packs, grayhair.
    575746|00000000||Good folk!
   1010973|00000000||Going somewhere, friend?
   1010971|00000000||Oh, no.
   1010969|00000000||Muuurdeeeer!
   1010967|00000000||I'll be damned!
   1053455|b9aef875||Medic
    363382|00000000||About your treasure…
    363384|00000000||Yes? Talk to me.
    385153|00000000||Thanks.
    385155|00000000||You've naught to thank me for - literally. You're no good to me if you suffocate.
    391750|00000000||Listen, I'll be upstairs if you need me. Sight of this empty vault's giving me an ulcer. Good luck to you!
    385149|00000000||Should look around the sewers. Got any more of that pops antidote?
    385151|00000000||I've a few vials left. Got the formula, too. Disgusting swill, to be honest. But it'll save your life. Here.
    385137|00000000||Gotta look around the sewers.
    385139|00000000||What kind of "something"?
    385141|00000000||Mind describing this "something" that crawled out of the water?
    425093|00000000||No. Doesn't mean I can, though. Air in the sewer's thick with spores, can hardly see a thing down there.
    425095|00000000||Musta noticed something. Was it…?
    385147|00000000||No, didn't notice a fucking thing. Didn't do a taxonomic field analysis either. I know it's an inconvenience to you, but I felt I should get the hell out of there as fast as I could.
    326616|00000000||Try to track down the thief yourself?
    385131|00000000||Of course. Hired this lummox, Fonce - thick enough not to ask questions. We knocked back some pops antidote and entered the sewers. Soon after, I returned alone.
    385133|00000000||What happened?
    385135|00000000||Lad started belchin' something horrendous - I mean, burps with so much mass the walls shook. Told him - Fonce, stop, you're in the presence of a count… well, former count, but still. And then he puked up. Up came most of the antidote, lost his protection.
    417735|00000000||Tried to pull him out, then I heard a bubbling… Something crawled out of the water.
    417737|00000000||I value the lives of my men, I do… But I value my own even more. Dropped Fonce and ran like hell.
    326624|00000000||Try to track down the thieves?
    378545|00000000||Boom? Can you elaborate?
    378547|00000000||Boom… Big… Er… this like.
    378549|00000000||I'll elaborate. Explosion - big enough to blow that fucking hole in the wall separating the vault from the sewers.
    378557|00000000||Gotten pretty good at communicating with this troll…
    378559|00000000||Lots of prior experience - worked with idiots my whole life.
    378541|00000000||Boom? Care to elaborate?
    378543|00000000||Bad mushrooms? Whaddaya mean?
    378551|00000000||Bad mushrooms - what's that about?
    378561|00000000||Pops mold. The spores are highly toxic - one whiff and you're dead. Unless you're a troll, that is.
    417650|00000000||Yes… Bart. Bart troll…
    417652|00000000||Not talking to you, dimwit. Where was I? Ah, mold spores. They cover the walls of the sewers other side of the vault. Actually thought it was a good thing, you know, a bit of extra protection. Thieves found a way through it.
    417654|00000000||Bart, you see them?
    378563|00000000||Bart through hole, want see boom got what. Breathe 'shroom. Sleep go. Chorfun gone. Bad troll…
    378565|00000000||Now, now. Stiff upper lip…
    364947|00000000||Take it the thieves got in through the hole behind you?
    349833|00000000||You're a regular fucking master sleuth. Any other brilliant deductions you want confirmed? The year, maybe? Bloody name of Redania's king?
    417646|00000000||No. But I am wondering, for instance, how that hole got there…
    378537|00000000||Hole no. Boom! Hole. Bart look want go… Bart look no, only sleep. Bad 'shrooms - head foozz.
    326536|00000000||Thieves got in through the hole?
    349846|00000000||How much was it all worth? Got an approximate idea?
    349848|00000000||Why the fuck do you care? Figuring your finder's fee? Don't get your hopes up.
    378594|00000000||Know you too well for that… Just prefer to know what I'm looking for.
    378596|00000000||Three crates of Nilfgaardian florens, a chest of emeralds, rubies, and topazes, silver candlesticks and platters… I could go on…
    417739|00000000||Shiny chorfun… All gone.
    326538|00000000||What're we saying was the value?
    364945|00000000||Any witnesses?
    326576|00000000||Anyone see what happened?
    326556|00000000||Other than Bart? No. And the vault's location is known only to the treasure's co-owners. Well, and the thieves.
    364838|00000000||What about upstairs? Anything unusual happen in the bathhouse the day of the break-in?
    364840|00000000||No. Happen swears it was calm as ever. The usual customers, no incidents. Bloody bucolic.
    363386|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
    363388|00000000||You're not exactly bursting with enthusiasm.
    349747|00000000||Witcher mutations. They strip us of emotion. I'd be jumping for joy otherwise.
    417644|00000000||All right. Oughta look around. But first - some questions.
    486613|00000000||I'm all ears.
    363369|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
    363129|00000000||It's a tall order, Dijkstra. Need to think it over.
    363131|00000000||Fine. Just remember… what you saw here - mum's the word. That's very important. I might even say it's a matter of life and death. Understood?
    363133|00000000||Understood.
    363135|00000000||Excellent.
    363371|00000000||Need to think it over.
    363367|00000000||Can't take care of this yourself?
    363373|00000000||Why don't you handle this? Gotta have connections in the underworld. Whaddaya need a witcher for?
    363375|00000000||Agh. The gold wasn't mine alone. See, I run a members-only savings club, a bank for the initiated.
    440986|00000000||For reasons that should be obvious, I'd prefer it if my temporary liquidity problems remained private… So I need an outsider.
    425954|00000000||How do you know you can trust me?
    487354|00000000||I don't… Counting on your survival instinct. Slip up, and I'll kill you, feed you to Bart.
    487356|00000000||Bart sorry. Bart job that got.
    349735|00000000||Don't seem to have trouble communicating with the troll… Why'd you bring me down here?
    440964|00000000||Take note of that hole. We'll come back to it later.
    349737|00000000||And see that door? Vault behind it - until recently filled with Novigrad crowns and countless other valuables.
    378473|00000000||Bart guard! Then boom! Chorfun go.
    378475|00000000||Translating into Common, someone fuckin' made off with nearly twenty tons of my gold, and all the lighter stuff. And you… will help me get it back.
    349731|00000000||Why'd you bring me here?
    349733|00000000||Where'd you get a troll?
    349766|00000000||Where'd you get the troll?
    349768|00000000||From Zerrikania. Won him. Card game with a camel merchant.
    376519|00000000||Your jokes are getting better by the minute.
    417640|00000000||See me smiling? I'm dead serious.
    417642|00000000||Bart eye bumpy horses. Hot there. Sigi Bart take. Good Sigi.
    349605|00000000||Bart! Stop that! Now!
    349609|00000000||Bart bad… Bart make Sigi lose chorfun.
    349611|00000000||Beating your head against the wall won't change that.
    349727|00000000||Bart hurt, Bart less thinky. Bart less thinky, Bart sadless.
    591823|00000000||Told ye - ye don't pay, ye can't live here! Now, out!
    591824|00000000||You're a heartless man… I have coin, at my old home…
    591825|00000000||Same ol' song since you moved in! Then go on, live there!
   1010978|00000000||But it's infested with beasts…
    593098|00000000||Not my problem! Get the hell outta me house, ye old bint!
    471625|00000000||Greetings. You Glenna?
    471627|00000000||Aye. But gristle and marrow's all I'm willin' to sell, and you'll have to wait till I'm done carvin' it.
    471633|00000000||Wanted to talk to you about Hanna. Hear you were friendly.
    592861|00000000||She'd come by atimes, we'd talk.
    592863|00000000||She seem strange lately? Any idea where she might've gone?
    592865|00000000||Hmm… Strange? No, a cheerful soul, always.
    592940|00000000||If I'm to judge, it's the wolves got her. Been howlin' the nights through, lately. Even the baron's men're afeared to come by.
    592945|00000000||Hanna must've gone to the wood, to gather mushrooms, maybe… Strayed too deep, and the howlers got her.
    471629|00000000||Wanted to ask about Hanna.
    586005|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
    471631|00000000||Farewell.
   1002209|00000000||Butcher in Velen - somehow seems a luxury.
   1002216|00000000||You the butcher's wife?
   1002218|00000000||Butcher? Please… Might've called him a butcher when we lived in the shade of Novigrad's walls.
   1002220|00000000||Now he deals in carrion, fallen animals, their bones still fit for soup. So, buyin' somethin'?
    586004|00000000||Oh, you again. What is it now?
    379462|00000000||A shrine dedicated to the Crones. The tome says the Trail of Treats starts here.
    573063|00000000||Good. Won't have to fumble with fasteners.
    573064|00000000||A skirt? Guess we're playing hunt-the-hare, not hide-and-seek.
    573065|00000000||Hm, shame. Coulda kept her shoes on.
    573066|00000000||Now where's that Cinderella gone to…?
   1000987|00000000||Keira…?
    590842|00000000||Wanna play hide-and-seek? Why not.
   1007156|00000000||I decide when I've heard enough.
   1007162|00000000||I decide when we're done with a subject. What's your connection to him?
   1007164|00000000||An old story… but if you insist. The student protests in 1242 - you've heard of them? I led them. Hubert, however, denounced me to the authorities. I landed in prison. There you have it.
   1007166|00000000||What will you do now?
   1007168|00000000||Plenty of leads. Woodcarver's workshop, the corpse collector who found him, alley where Priscilla was attacked… Got work to do.
   1007170|00000000||As do I - at the hospital. I must return there. But I shall keep my fingers crossed.
   1007173|00000000||And I'll keep my eye on you.
   1007158|00000000||Don't aim to press you.
   1007160|00000000||Thank you. I've nothing to hide… It's just an old wound. Unhealed as yet.
   1007155|00000000||Won't press you.
   1003452|00000000||Mighta told me you know the coroner. We could've skipped the trip through the sewers.
   1003454|00000000||I know him - thus I avoid him. I've said enough on the subject.
   1003383|00000000||Could've told me you know the coroner.
   1003384|00000000||Nathaniel… Who is he?
   1003442|00000000||Nathaniel… Who is he?
   1003444|00000000||A scoundrel, a rogue. Like every man who wears the robes of the Eternal Fire.
   1003446|00000000||Most are scoundrels before they ever put on the robes.
   1003448|00000000||True in his case as well… Before he donned the frock, Nathaniel was a torturer. Delighted especially in torturing women.
   1005626|00000000||Later Hierarch Hemmelfart appointed him to oversee the morgue. He deals with the Temple Guard, supervises cremations, conducts funeral masses in the temple on the isle, and so forth.
   1003450|00000000||Mhm. Dream job.
    342544|00000000||Why'd you cover for us?
   1003378|00000000||I was covering my own arse. If Reverend Nathaniel had learned someone had entered the morgue, then cut open a corpse without his permission, I'd be in deep trouble. But you didn't give that a thought, did you, Joachim? As ever.
   1003380|00000000||Well, while I don't approve of your willfulness, I also wish to see this murderer hang. So, should I learn anything new related to this case, I will let you know.
   1003382|00000000||Mhm. Thank you.
    586777|00000000||Not the marks of a garkain or a fleder.
   1038390|00000000||Gotta be an ekimmara.
    586778|00000000||Blood, but not human. Monster was wounded.
    586798|00000000||Seems like it had lost some strength, was sneaking along the shoreline.
    586799|00000000||Vampire was wounded, needed fresh blood.
    595788|00000000||Wouldn't 'ave ventured far from its lair if it was weak.
    586800|00000000||Tracks end here.
    595790|00000000||Oughta look for prints on the other side.
    586801|00000000||Rat corpses. Not a drop of blood left in 'em.
    586804|00000000||Lair must be nearby.
    586773|00000000||Blood's all sucked out. A lesser vampire?
    586805|00000000||Ekimmara came out of the water here. Gotta look for more tracks.
    464781|00000000||A witcher! By the gods, help me!
   1054282|00000000||{Mòran taing, vatt'ghern. } [We thank you, witcher!]
   1054361|00000000||Ever felt the urge to go to sea, witcher? Now those are monsters!
    354838|00000000||Fine. But no torturing.
    352530|00000000||Fine. Take her. I'd rather she didn't interrupt my conversation. But hands off, don't touch her.
    352532|00000000||Why? Feel sorry the bitch?
    380540|00000000||No. Couldn't give a shit about her… But if I don't get what I want from Menge, I'll want to sell her to someone else. Don't want you damaging the goods.
    380542|00000000||Keen nose for enterprise. You'd make a great madame.
    489280|00000000||Don't you worry, Menge'll give you your coin… And Merigold will get what she deserves.
    380538|00000000||I've had enough of this shit.
    370671|00000000||Enough.
    370673|00000000||All right, had enough of this charade.
    380544|00000000||What're you on about?
    380546|00000000||Watch and learn.
    390211|00000000||No torture till I get there. Got it?
    390213|00000000||Got it… No torture…
    408321|00000000||Wha…? Whoreson's castin' spells! Get him!
    390207|00000000||Don't start torturing her without me.
    370669|00000000||Take her.
    354840|00000000||Do what you want.
    354842|00000000||Come on, witch… Show you the wonders a pair of pliers can work. You'll be surprised.
    354836|00000000||Fine, take her.
    418750|00000000||Here's where we split up. Go see Menge. Merigold'll be next door.
    489274|00000000||You can't have her until I get--
    489276|00000000||You don't set the terms here. Dirk! You know what to do.
    380534|00000000||You won't get a word out of me. Not you, not him.
    380536|00000000||Playin' tough, eh? Just you wait… We'll take a fingernail or three. That oughta get you singin'.
   1011392|00000000||Not jarred-off easily, eh?
   1011404|00000000||What? Smartass, eh?
   1011402|00000000||Any smartasses?
   1011400|00000000||Not bad.
   1011398|00000000||{Hrr..pfu!}
   1011396|00000000||Kill!
   1011394|00000000||I'll kill you!
   1037350|00000000||So… when're we gonna go noodlin' for catfish?
   1039616|00000000||I'm done fishin' with ye. Ye forget what happened last time?
   1039618|00000000||What about last time? Shouldnae 'ave yanked so hard, ye wouldnae 'ave fallen in.
   1039134|00000000||Heeeeeelp!
    433821|00000000||Hey, over here! Help me!
    506936|00000000||Indeed.
    506938|00000000||Indeed. Going on some voyage, looking for a companion, right?
    496558|00000000||Plan's crazier than it is sane… But there's an irresistible charm to it. Offer me some pay, and I'll help you out.
    496559|00000000||Don't you fret about coin - I brought home a good deal of it from various fronts. Say we meet in Skellige, by the collapsed bridge near Arinbjorn. It's but a hop away from the bed where black pearls are born. Will that work for you?
    506008|00000000||Sounds fine. See you there.
    496552|00000000||I'll help you.
    496563|00000000||Sorry, got other things to worry about. Good luck, though… you'll need a bit of that.
    496553|00000000||Sorry, I have other things to worry about.
    496533|00000000||Not just "some" voyage - 'cross the sea! Mark this: when I got pressed into the infantry in 1242, I promised my beloved Letta I'd return alive, whole and with a pearl from Skellige. Not just any pearl, either. A black one! The rarest and most precious!
    496550|00000000||Well, well… Ambitious.
    496551|00000000||Perhaps… But they were empty words. I came from the war, that one and the next, but I never fulfilled my promise. High time to change that. For if not now, then when?
   1029032|00000000||Thing is… I've grown old in the meantime. As you see! Can't manage it alone, need a strong shoulder to lean on… and a witcher's shoulder's as strong as they come! So… whaddaya say?
    506923|00000000||Not quite… but what's it about? I hear right - you're going on some voyage, need a companion?
    496526|00000000||Not exactly… but what's it about?
    496528|00000000||Never mind. Farewell.
    496527|00000000||Farewell.
    496525|00000000||A witcher? Oh! Here about the notice, perchance?
   1001044|00000000||Found me. Congratulations.
   1001046|00000000||Do I get a prize?
   1001048|00000000||I've nothing on me, but I'll think of something.
    437358|00000000||Blood… Many must have died here.
    491811|00000000||Hmm… this the lute he got from the elves of Dol Blathanna?
    491812|00000000||Aye. Must've been in a great rush to leave it behind.
    491934|00000000||Keep forgettin' he's got that damn fool name.
    491933|00000000||The faculty of Oxenfurt University is honored to grant Julian Alfred Pankratz, viscount de Lettenhove, the title of Master of the Seven Liberal Arts.
    492040|00000000||Annual Balladry Contest, Silver Laurel, awarded to Master Dandelion.
    492041|00000000||Prince Hereward himself did the honors.
    497003|00000000||And the feast afterwards, to celebrate the laureates! Dandelion taught a swine to yodel, and I… ah, another time.
    492055|00000000||From the finest vineyards, every last one.
    492056|00000000||No one knows the fruit of the fruit of the vine like Dandelion.
    492068|00000000||Ahah! A note from a grateful muse!
    497019|00000000||Reading someone else's letters? Tsk, tsk.
    492069|00000000||…my visage red and hot… I plunged into purest ecstasy, imbibing its nectar…
    497023|00000000||… your dexterous digits on my soul's yearning chords.
   1055805|00000000||Aye, and the sword's too big!
   1055807|00000000||By the bye, is that how it's done? Killin' a wyvern?
   1055809|00000000||Hm… Technique's not quite right, but you gotta admit he's doing it with gusto.
   1055788|00000000||Hm… Nose is too small.
   1004339|00000000||And when the Great Dark descends…
   1004340|00000000||Brother against brother will brawl. Fathers their cubs will spurn, large and small.
   1004341|00000000||Rot will the seed and wither the crops…
   1004342|00000000||Wolves will leave crows corpse upon corpse.
   1004343|00000000||For when the Great Dark descends, it will consume all, bring all to an end…
    577941|00000000||Take it, but… kill Luzi, promise me. She shouldn't suffer no more.
    577920|00000000||Seems your White Lady's a noonwraith.
    577921|00000000||That means… Gods. Poor Luzi!
    577938|00000000||Luzi… She was gonna marry, right?
    577940|00000000||Yea. Her parents swore her to a smith from the city. Well-to-do, sure, but older and more brittle than elven ruins. Luzi ran from the altar out into the fields…
    591303|00000000||Where she slashed her veins. Used the silver dagger she'd gotten for the betrothal. Wait… let me show you.
    591306|00000000||Luzi's parents couldn't bear to sell it, bury it, even. They left it in my care.
    591308|00000000||I wanna send her away, but I've gotta bring her close, lure her, first. I need an object that belonged to her. Dagger would be perfect…
    577918|00000000||The White Lady - I know what it is.
    577942|00000000||Problem solved. You can go back to your fields.
    577943|00000000||Thank you. Your coin… And may fortune smile upon you.
    577892|00000000||Got rid of the White Lady.
    591358|00000000||Yeah, I'll take care of it… using more effective means than brave Micko.
    591342|00000000||I'll help you.
   1067958|00000000||Oh! Master witcher…! If I had that much coin, you think I'd still be workin' the fields?
   1067960|00000000||Hm. It's too much… Come down a ways, and we might agree.
   1067962|00000000||Oh, so be it… I can toss in that bit.
   1067964|00000000||You tryin' to fleece me? I'm a simple woman, but it don't mean I can't count. We've "bargained" enough. You'll get what's offered and that's that.
    591356|00000000||White Lady can wait. Let's talk about my pay first.
    591343|00000000||Let's talk about my reward first.
    591344|00000000||I'll think it over.
    591354|00000000||Need to think it over.
    577945|00000000||Farewell.
    577893|00000000||Farewell.
    577891|00000000||Here about the notice.
    577894|00000000||Here about the White Lady.
    577895|00000000||As I hoped. My notice has been hangin' so long, sun's near bleached it blank.
    591312|00000000||Managed to decipher it, somehow… But I need more information.
    591314|00000000||Ask away. Afraid to go out in the fields anyway, for fear of endin' up like Micko and his band.
    577933|00000000||So, the White Lady haunts your fields?
    577934|00000000||True, just past the hut, near the ol' tower. Folk say she's made her home there.
    577897|00000000||Lady haunts the fields?
    577896|00000000||Micko and his band? Who're they?
    577923|00000000||Micko and his band - who're they?
    577924|00000000||Four lads, drunkards and good-for-nothin's, all. They'd drained a few pints and decided they'd all plough the White Lady, maybe then she'd bugger off.
    591336|00000000||Romantics.
    591338|00000000||Mhm. Seems the White Lady spurned their advances. They still lie in the field… Folk're afeared to bury 'em.
    577909|00000000||So… will you save us from her?
    591360|00000000||So what'll it be? Will you help?
    577890|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
    517395|00000000||Heey! Open up!
    517394|00000000||People! Help me!
    517420|00000000||Take this… Burn it, hide it, whichever. Just don't get caught!
   1006951|00000000||Hm, quite the brew. Halfling wasn't lying… Scent's gotta be carrying quite a ways…
   1017888|00000000||Release her.
   1017931|00000000||One of you restrain him. Then make sure he gets a good view.
   1017889|00000000||Let go of her. Step away.
   1017896|00000000||What's this about?
   1017924|00000000||It's about Madame Sasha swallowin' my mushroom farming nonsense hook, line and sinker. When she should've been more vigilant.
   1017928|00000000||So, will you tell him who you spy for? Or would you rather scream it out?
   1017886|00000000||What's he talking about, Sasha?
   1014731|00000000||Which one's Hortensia?
   1009351|00000000||The tall one.
   1009354|00000000||Masquerade's done, Tulle. Give us the coin.
   1014748|00000000||Masquerade - hah! Well put. Been watchin' you from the start, sweetheart. Though I ought to admit I thought you'd follow me alone.
   1014749|00000000||Told him who you are yet? No? I'm sure he'd love to hear it. Go on. Tell him. Or I'll tell Hortensia to break your fingers.
    515388|00000000||Why the devil are there witch hunters here to start with? They didn't ride from Novigrad to hang two blobtits, did they?
    522433|00000000||I-I-I don't know, m'Lord.
    515400|00000000||They say where they were headed?
    522774|00000000||Geralt! Good you've arrived. Can't draw any meanin' from this rabble's bawlin'. Perhaps they'd talk some sense after a few lashes.
    522776|00000000||Well? Spit it out - where'd they go?!
    515401|00000000||T-to the v-v-village in the swamp, m'Lord. Lass rode with 'em - askin' after her mother, constant.
    515383|00000000||Gotta prepare.
    515407|00000000||Gotta prepare.
    515428|00000000||Prepare, now? Will you shine your boots or trim your nails?
    522525|00000000||Argh, do what you will! I shall take my men and go.
    515619|00000000||Meet you at the Crones' village.
    515405|00000000||Agreed.
    515406|00000000||I'll gather my men!
    515382|00000000||You're right.
    522421|00000000||Lass? We must go there at once, Geralt!
    515269|00000000||A beauty? What the devil do you mean?
    522411|00000000||A great mare, a horse fiend… Folk done went mad, lunged at each other. Murderin' all, neighbors or young 'uns…
    515378|00000000||It's the spirit of the forest. Taking revenge on those who sought its demise, driving them mad.
    522565|00000000||Geralt! Good you've arrived. I've trouble drawing any sense from their canting. Should give 'em a taste of the whip, to bring 'em in line, 'cause--
    515270|00000000||M-m'Lord, 'tis what th-they said, too! About the mare, meanin'. That it's the f-forest's dark g-ghost.
    515368|00000000||Who claimed so?
    515369|00000000||Th-The w-w-witch hunters. Passed through just now, headin' for the v-v-village in the swamp. S-s-some l-lass was l-l-leadin' 'em, askin' after her mother.
   1020528|00000000||Just interested in the one.
   1020530|00000000||Just interested in the one.
   1020529|00000000||Be glad to look over what you got.
   1020527|00000000||Glad to look at the others.
   1020519|00000000||A man came to me a few years past, paid me to keep a book for you. Said you'd come for it one day.
   1024077|00000000||Who was he?
   1024079|00000000||Umm… He didn't introduce himself. But the book has a red cover, that I remember. I'm sure I've not sold it.
   1020522|00000000||All right, see if I can find it.
   1020523|00000000||And perhaps glance at the others while you're at it?
   1020516|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, known as the White Wolf? The Butcher of Blaviken?
   1020517|00000000||Geralt of Rivia's enough. What is it?
   1044064|00000000||"Dining Set from which Emperor Emhyr Ate during His Coronation Ceremony."
   1031346|00000000||We could conquer all Nilfgaard with this fighter! Sukrus, forgive me! I love you like a brother, you unkempt bugger! Friends?
   1031347|00000000||Course, friends! What good has bickerin' ever brought us?
   1031348|00000000||Where's that drakkar that hit me?
   1031349|00000000||Don't mean to spoil your reunion, but what'll we do with van Hoorn?
   1031350|00000000||We'll take him to Skellige 'fore he comes to. Won't be any more trouble to ye. And maybe we'll try a new venture? But first we've to move these crates to Hattori's.
   1031351|00000000||True. I oughta pay him a visit him, too.
    349475|f4ee18de||Necrophage
   1032703|00000000||Sonny, we gotta haul some cheese into town. We're clean outta crowns.
   1032705|00000000||There's bandits prowlin' just outside o' town, foreigners everywhere.
   1032707|00000000||There's a war on… Folk're seekin' refuge. Some of 'em aren't honest - it's the way o' the world.
   1032709|00000000||We'll take the neighbors. Bandits might be afeared to attack a larger group.
    564610|00000000||Human.
    564612|00000000||Claw marks, bite marks. Armor ripped to shreds…
    564644|00000000||A lot of blood… too much for one body.
    564617|00000000||No sign of another corpse.
    564619|00000000||Mhm. Flying monster. Gripped the second body in its claws. Didn't quite get everything to its nest.
    564634|00000000||Piece by piece, follow the thread…
    564637|00000000||Tracks end here. Damn birds must've picked the ground clean.
   1016013|00000000||But they've already found the rest of the corpse, probably. All I gotta do is follow the cawing.
    564641|00000000||Thin rachides, sparse after feathers… Interesting.
    564758|00000000||An archgriffin.
   1016024|00000000||And the nest? Empty, except for leftovers.
   1016027|00000000||Well, well. They took on this contract before I did. Got the reward up front. More than they're paying me…
   1016029|00000000||Wake up, you whoreson.
   1016031|00000000||There it is.
    564611|00000000||And again… A mortal wound, looks like.
   1011266|00000000||Water's gonna rise.
   1011264|00000000||Just came ashore and people are already pissing me off!
   1011262|00000000||Hey!
   1011260|00000000||Slice 'em!
   1030490|00000000||How 'bout a threesome, love?
   1030492|00000000||You mean me to grab another lass to join us?
   1030494|00000000||Naw… I was thinkin' it'd be us two and you.
   1030496|00000000||Oh, all right… But what with the state you two are in, you've got to fluff each other first.
   1010956|00000000||Ptooey!
   1010954|00000000||A warlock.
   1010952|00000000||Blooood!
    439593|00000000||Strange. Butcher swore he saw her here.
    439597|00000000||Maybe he lied.
    439599|00000000||He lied when I cut off his first finger. They all grow very honest after I take a second.
    450027|00000000||The ginger bitch hides behind her witchcraft… But we'll find her. Matter of time.
   1073059|00000000||Key's gotta be 'ere somewhere!
   1070709|00000000||When I've a matter for you, I'll find you.
   1070696|00000000||Greetings, Geralt.
   1070698|00000000||Idle chatter - I'm not interested.
   1038531|00000000||Archgriffin feather. Must've lost it when taking off. Hopefully its nest is nearby.
   1053543|00000000||Hey, Jackie… you're the oldest, so tell us. Just what's a whore do, exactly?
   1053545|00000000||Well… My dad told me they do the things mum won't.
   1053547|00000000||Hmm… my mum hates to do the laundry. So's that what all those gentlemen do at the Passiflora - get their laundry done?
   1053549|00000000||Guess so. Looked in the window once, they was all prancin' round in their knickers…
   1053551|00000000||So why's my dad say the Passiflora's the best 'cause it's got the dirtiest whores?
   1053555|00000000||Golly… adults're strange.
    453471|00000000||A witcher? And not a second too soon!
    513580|00000000||Give me the reward.
    513607|00000000||I'm due a reward. Give me some coin.
    513609|00000000||A reward, aye… Your due… Here.
   1067275|00000000||What?! Ye fall on your head today?!
   1067277|00000000||Just a smidgen too high, that…
   1067279|00000000||All right… Me brother's life's at stake, so I can't skimp. It's a deal!
   1067281|00000000||Here we is, chatterin' on and on, while Mikkel might be coming to harm. Take the offer, or I'll find me another to do the job.
    513562|00000000||Could look into it… if you paid me more.
    513578|00000000||Let's talk about the reward.
    445110|00000000||Farewell.
    445112|00000000||So long.
    513564|00000000||Sorry, can't take this on right now.
    513579|00000000||Maybe later.
    513577|00000000||I'll look for your brother.
    513558|00000000||All right, I'll look for your brother. How will I recognize him?
    513560|00000000||Shouldn't be hard. He were the only lad in a group o' women.
   1052132|00000000||Corpses aren't always in a condition where I can determine the sex.
   1052134|00000000||Corpses?! Take it back! They got lost, is all. But if worst comes to worst… well, he had calfskin ankle boots, work of Master Clogs. Told him not to wear 'em into the hills, he'd only ruin them. But he was so proud of 'em…
   1052136|00000000||Think I know enough… Thanks.
    513611|00000000||Risked my life. Think I deserve something for that.
    513613|00000000||Here… now piss off.
    513603|00000000||I risked my life.
    513605|00000000||Your brother was a better man… So long.
    513581|00000000||I'm not going to beg.
    441312|00000000||I have bad news. An arachas killed your brother. If it's any comfort, I avenged him.
    441314|00000000||Comfort, hah, 'course it's no comfort… And I told Mikkel, "Why ye so eager to help strangers, sit your arse down or there'll be misfortune!"
    445565|00000000||Well? Why you still standin' there? Can't get your fill of others' misfortune?
    445572|00000000||No. I prefer porridge and gravy, like everybody else. Pay me and I'll go buy some.
    513576|00000000||I'd 'ave paid ye if you'd brought Mikkel back alive.
    507986|00000000||Your brother's dead.
    445108|00000000||Here about the contract.
    445100|00000000||Understand you have a contract for me?
    445102|00000000||Aye. It's me brother, Mikkel. Been a week now since he took the women of Bellows into the hills.
    508158|00000000||The women of Bellows?
    508159|00000000||Bellows were a rich village… till the war passed through. Huts were burned down, larders cleared out, all the men folk conscripted. Women were left to fend for themselves, without food nor shelter.
    508170|00000000||No one wanted 'em. Redanians wouldn't let 'em into Novigrad, so Mikkel took them to the old mines, get 'em out of the rain, at least. And I've not had word from him since.
    513518|00000000||Given your offer some thought…
    507701|00000000||Greetin's.
   1040634|00000000||Do you feel that? A flow of fresh air, from the left? Must be an exit that way!
   1040808|00000000||Good, let's get outta here.
   1040822|00000000||Wait. There's still the magic lamp.
   1040824|00000000||The magic what now?
   1040825|00000000||Lamp. The elf promised it to me in exchange for my help. And since his return here seems doubtful, I must retrieve it myself.
   1040636|00000000||If I can find it, that is… Will you help?
   1040596|00000000||I'm going straight to the Bog.
   1040606|00000000||Gotta look for it alone. I should go to Crookback Bog. Think you can manage?
   1040632|00000000||Of course I can. Best of luck to you.
   1040598|00000000||Yeah, I'll help.
   1040630|00000000||Splendid. Come, then.
   1040595|00000000||Fine. I'll help.
   1061687|1d2a6527||Drunk
   1004743|00000000||Ever fish on Wyndamer Lake?
   1004744|00000000||No. Don't plan to, either.
   1004745|00000000||Hmm. Folk tell stories about that place…
   1004746|00000000||Can hear hellish moans and wails there the night. And it reeks of sulfur a mile off!
   1034906|00000000||Let me alone, or regret it!
   1034908|00000000||What'll you do to me, dove? Spank me?
   1072296|00000000||Even dangerous bein' a fisherman these days! Got beasts prowlin' 'neath the waves, raiders prowlin' upon 'em!
   1061591|00000000||Hullo! I say, master witcher!
   1061601|00000000||We meet again, master!
   1061593|00000000||Do I look at all familiar, master witcher?
   1071974|00000000||My associate and me - you were kind enough to save us. From the very guards I myself had hired, no less.
   1061595|00000000||Ah, right. Rings a bell now. Get to your destination all right?
   1061597|00000000||We did - and we were lucky to, for the trade proved surprisingly robust. I've new goods, now, if you're interested.
   1061599|00000000||Naturally, at a sizeable discount. It's your due.
   1061588|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look.
   1061589|00000000||Farewell.
    421176|00000000||So long.
   1048682|002e305a||Roche's Follower
    421083|00000000||Geralt, I've got a problem. Can we talk?
    467823|00000000||Could've handled that myself, too.
    467843|00000000||You know, I could've handled that on my own, too.
    467845|00000000||I don't doubt it. I merely wished to prove that we of the fairer sex can deliver a thorough thrashing as well.
    467847|00000000||So long… and, uh, work on your guard a bit. You're dropping it too low.
    467839|00000000||Huh. You actually do manage fine on your own…
    467841|00000000||One thing I've learnt is that you either let the lads beat you, or learn to beat like the lads!
    467821|00000000||Huh. You really do manage fine on your own.
    466835|00000000||Huh? You?!
    466837|00000000||Why? How many distressed damsels have you rescued of late? I believed I was special!
   1032667|00000000||Made no more last month than I made in a week this time last year.
   1032669|00000000||Everybody's skimpin'. There's a war on, folk don't spend coin on new clothes.
   1032671|00000000||That's fool talk! War or no war, the rich're always fond of finery.
   1032673|00000000||Then why're they not givin' me anythin' to sew?
   1032675|00000000||Cause new fashions've come, where you're still sewin' the old shite.
    173715|00000000||Clothing. They change in here?
    384178|00000000||She's in a foul mood. We'd best come back on the morrow.
    560771|00000000||No, I'm stayin' here… Maybe I'll spot Hanna.
    560772|00000000||Your soup's goin' cold.
    592195|00000000||Let it. All the same to me.
    592197|00000000||You've got to eat , come inside.
    585942|00000000||Let us mourn in peace.
    585940|00000000||Leave me be, please.
   1076288|00000000||Let me to grieve, murderer!
   1011675|00000000||Ever play gwent?
   1013639|00000000||I do. Gwent's like politics, just more honest.
   1011678|00000000||Care for a game against an old master?
   1011683|00000000||Yeah, let's play.
   1011666|00000000||Let's play.
   1011686|00000000||I'll stop by some other time, we'll play then.
   1011667|00000000||Another time.
   1011679|00000000||Time for a round of cards?
   1011680|00000000||Ah, yes, sure.
   1011665|00000000||How about a game of gwent?
   1011687|00000000||Not bad. See you don't have Esterad Thyssen in your deck. Here, he's yours.
   1011688|00000000||Thanks. Know anyone else I could win some cards off of?
   1076501|00000000||Hm… I know an elf you might try. Got an excellent card in his deck. You'll find him beyond the city walls, where the Scoia'tael stragglers have their shantytown.
   1011685|00000000||Know what? You should really stick to killing monsters.
   1011689|00000000||There's Olivier at the Kingfisher. I play him sometimes. And there was a spell there I hoped to win the Katakan off Madman Lugos, but after I beat him once the bugger would never play me again.
   1052300|00000000||Fresh halibut, I need some.
   1052302|00000000||Of course. Prime halibut, coming your way.
   1052304|00000000||You hard of hearing, Zagar? The man asked for fresh halibut, not the carrion you've on your stall.
   1052306|00000000||Shut your trap.
   1052308|00000000||Only fish from today's catch at my stall, sir! Don't settle for anything less!
    496816|00000000||Hey there! Master witcher! Over here!
   1038021|00000000||Thanks. Ugh, how will I ever explain this to Cleaver?
   1039669|00000000||I'd recommend a letter.
   1039676|00000000||Right. Gotta pack.
   1038022|00000000||Good luck, then. Farewell.
    552454|00000000||Ghouls… And where there's ghouls… there's usually corpses…
    552455|00000000||Anyone there?! You can come out! It's safe now!
    552478|00000000||Thrown to the ground with great force… Internal hemorrhaging.
    552479|00000000||Jaws strong enough to crush armor.
    552483|00000000||Armor pierced, arteries torn open.
    552530|00000000||Scent of blood's still strong. Oughta follow it.
    552590|00000000||Human blood.
    552591|00000000||Fur shreds.
    552592|00000000||An ekimmara. Hibernated here… till the villagers woke it.
    552795|00000000||Ghouls tore the dog to bits. Soldiers died some other way.
   1003773|00000000||Handiwork of ghouls.
   1007960|00000000||Scent of blood leads to the hut.
    552589|00000000||Hmm, planks can be lifted.
   1004660|00000000||He's an arse, not a baron.
   1004661|00000000||A bandit with sorry rabble for armed men…
   1004662|00000000||Watch what you say, old man.
   1004663|00000000||Or what? I tell ye Black Ones'll drive him off sooner or later.
   1004664|00000000||Or he'll end like the last man who ruled Crow's Perch.
   1003898|00000000||Quite the work my man's got, eh?
   1003900|00000000||Not half bad.
   1003902|00000000||Brought home a bucket of peelin's yesterday. The feast we had!
   1003904|00000000||He's not scared?
   1003906|00000000||Baron finds out someone's stealin' food for the pigs…
    531987|00000000||Wake up. It's just a dream.
    531989|00000000||Wake up!
   1044150|00000000||The doll… The attic…
   1056110|00000000||Boot prints… Traces of sewer slime.
   1056108|00000000||Blood… Fresh.
    473039|00000000||He'll kill the lot of us one of these days.
    473037|00000000||That's it. Gone completely barmy on us.
   1048285|00000000||Hahahaha… Lookie, a right brawl that is!
    394923|00000000||Ah, what a sight! You really showed them! One, two… Over the back! Then, pow! Right in the noggin…
    394925|00000000||I'll finally be able to leave my home without hiding beneath a hood. Thank you… very much!
    394927|00000000||C'mon... It was nothing...
    394929|00000000||Oh, it was something all right! And don't dare think we've forgotten our promise. We'll strip our voices ragged praising Irina's new play!
    446422|00000000||How much'll I owe you?
    446424|00000000||Not a copper! Helped us out. See no reason why we shouldn't help you. Get half of town to come to the play, wait and see!
   1066493|00000000||Some quick preparations and we'll be out in the streets. Till the next!
    505758|00000000||Came here to fight the Tailor, so let's do this.
    505759|00000000||Novigraders one and all! A momentous occurrence! Before us, in just minutes, Geralt of Rivia will face the Tailor!
    505760|00000000||Come here, bitch… Uncle Durden wants to sew you a new face.
    542648|00000000||I'm ready.
    542650|00000000||Fight!
    505750|00000000||Let's start.
    505753|00000000||Sorry, your elf's an idiot. Not about to touch him, let alone fight him.
    505752|00000000||Take this fight and shove it.
    505751|00000000||This champion's a dick.
    505754|00000000||This elf's a dick. That been the case with all champions of Novigrad?
    505755|00000000||No. I am the first. Do you know why they call me the Tailor? It began after I'd gutted some men. With these very hands.
    542646|00000000||Hrr, knew that was gonna be a shitty story.
    505748|00000000||We've been expecting you. We're already taking bets.
    505749|00000000||You've been weighed, you've been measured, and you've been found scrawny. In what world could you possibly defeat me?
    517148|00000000||Don't rule out the stranger - he's defeated the illustrious Olaf of Skellige!
    517146|00000000||The newcomer may seem all skin and bones, but remember, he defeated the sergeant to the Bloody Baron of Velen!
    517147|00000000||And Olaf of Skellige as well!
    542651|00000000||I wanna fight the Tailor… again.
    542653|00000000||Hehehe, be my guest.
   1054153|5b5cc0b4||Cow
    424925|00000000||May I join you?
    424927|00000000||I've never seen you here before.
    454306|00000000||Here to see Whoreson.
    454296|00000000||Here to talk to Whoreson.
    440051|00000000||Wanna talk to the owner first.
    440055|00000000||The owner - tell me where he is. Gotta talk to him.
    440057|00000000||Oh my, you see… Junior's a dear friend.
    454405|00000000||I spoke to him today. Know what he said?
    454407|00000000||"You find anyone sniffing around for me, they're to stop sniffing, for good."
    440061|00000000||Take him! Alive!
    427399|00000000||Heard Junior comes here sometimes.
    427401|00000000||Did you, now…? What else have you heard?
    454394|00000000||Whoreson around or not?
    454396|00000000||Junior was right! Someone's after him!
    454398|00000000||Disarm this man!
    454378|00000000||Wanna talk to the owner.
    454308|00000000||Is that important?
    454380|00000000||All who come here do so either by invitation or recommendation.
    454382|00000000||Who recommended this establishment to you?
    454278|00000000||So what?
    454288|00000000||Never seen you here, either.
    454290|00000000||You've clearly no notion who I am. Don't be clever with me. We don't like clever men around here.
    454292|00000000||How did you even learn of this place?
    424931|00000000||Haven't seen you here, either.
    424929|00000000||First time here.
    454282|00000000||Course you haven't. It's my first time here.
    454284|00000000||This seat is taken.
    454286|00000000||And anyway, high-stakes at this table.
    454294|00000000||I got coin.
    424935|00000000||Got the coin for it.
    427395|00000000||I couldn't care less if you've coin or not.
    454280|00000000||What concerns me is how you got in.
    454304|00000000||They let me in. Isn't that enough?
    454298|00000000||Men at the door let me in. Not good enough?
    454300|00000000||No. Preferable if someone vouched for you… soon.
    454302|00000000||Until then - I'll have my eye on you.
    396599|00000000||Changed my mind.
    396627|00000000||Changed my mind. Rather not sit down to a game right now.
    396629|00000000||No one's compelling you. Return once you get the urge.
    454820|00000000||Farewell.
    440053|00000000||Just wanna play.
    440091|00000000||We done talking? I'd like to play.
    440067|00000000||All right, take a seat.
    396601|00000000||Deal me in, then.
    396597|00000000||Let's play.
    407630|00000000||May I?
    396595|00000000||You again? Oh, all right. We're about to deal.
    414236|00000000||I have no more money. Not a single crown…
    396645|00000000||The luck! Hah! Jolly good hands!
    398184|00000000||I noticed.
    398186|00000000||I've a mind to let you win some back if you bring more coin.
    396659|00000000||I win.
    398123|00000000||Don't you think I know that?
    398125|00000000||Want a rematch?
    398127|00000000||What with? You've left me high and dry. I'll not bet half a crown more.
   1069920|00000000||Experimenting on humans… Never would've gotten away with it if the Conclave were still in charge.
   1039186|00000000||Your brother-in-law's debt…
    540988|00000000||What did you want me to do?
    540989|00000000||If I'm to work for ye, you gotta tend to the merchant in the port.
    540990|00000000||Tend to him?
    540991|00000000||Get me coin back or smash up his stock of mead.
    535895|00000000||Kidding, right?
    535890|00000000||I'll be back.
    540739|00000000||I'll be back. Take care.
    540740|00000000||See you, Geralt.
    540728|00000000||You're joking, right? No, thanks.
   1039210|00000000||Ye change your mind, ye know where to find me.
   1074618|00000000||Not about to do that.
   1074617|00000000||Fine. I'll take care of it.
   1074620|00000000||Ahhh, not thrilled, but so be it.
    540720|00000000||Hhhh, dammit. I'll do it. Where'll I find him?
   1007977|00000000||Nearby, at the docks. Ye know what? I don't care for his coin, all in all. If ye don't get it back, I won't mind.
   1007979|00000000||So what do you want me to do?
    540721|00000000||Smash his stock of mead. Was me brought it in from An Skellig.
    540722|00000000||That a mature thing to do?
    540723|00000000||Nay, but it's fair.
    535894|00000000||Fine, I'll do it.
    540714|00000000||Looking for a bodyguard. Interested?
    540715|00000000||Why not. If there's coin in it.
    540716|00000000||Well, there isn't, not yet.
    540717|00000000||So we're to barter? Favor for a favor, aye?
    540718|00000000||I'm gonna kill you, Hattori… Yeah, I guess. What did you have in mind?
    540719|00000000||Me brother-in-law owes me some coin. Get it back, and we’ll talk.
    535887|00000000||I've got a job for you.
   1039173|00000000||Got your coin back, I think.
    540981|00000000||Took care of it. Trader said he'd give you a letter of credit - issued by the Vivaldis' bank.
    540982|00000000||Is that so? Well done, mate! So who am I to knock off?
    540983|00000000||Just want you to keep an eye on someone. This swordsmith - seems you know each other…
    540984|00000000||Éibhear Hattori, the elf? Tried swindlin' me on axes once, the bastard. You workin' for him?
   1039221|00000000||You could say that. We're trying to dismantle the swordsmithing monopoly in Novigrad.
   1039223|00000000||Oooh, a noble cause! Well, you're vouchin' for him, don't see why not. I'll grab some of the boys and we can go.
    540980|00000000||Got rid of that shipment.
   1039171|00000000||Got rid of the mead.
    535889|00000000||You and the merchant - why'd you fight?
    540724|00000000||You and the merchant - what was that about?
    540725|00000000||Argh, why me sis wedded that ploughin' rotter is beyond me.
    540726|00000000||That was your brother-in-law?
    540727|00000000||Prick-in-law, more like. Sweet-talked me at first: Skellige mead, we need barrels, we'll be rich men. So I brought it in. Then he starts goin' on about unforeseen storage costs, net-gross balances, and I dunno what else.
   1007981|00000000||Business and family just don't mix.
   1007983|00000000||Exactly, mate.
   1007989|00000000||What brings you here, Geralt?
    540712|00000000||Greetings.
    540713|00000000||Aye aye, Geralt, how you doin'?
   1003895|00000000||Forgot how hard you Skelligers hit. I'm Geralt.
   1003896|00000000||Sukrus. Ye ever need remindin', you know where to find me, mate.
   1031671|00000000||An ale to patch things? Come, we'll talk inside.
   1003893|00000000||Sorry, but you asked for it. I'm Geralt.
   1003894|00000000||Sukrus. You did well, mate.
    361747|00000000||Enough! We seen your point, master.
    361749|00000000||Go home. You're done here.
    537531|00000000||Oh, damn, I'm horny.
    537530|00000000||Here to guard, not to wag my tongue.
    537529|00000000||I don't know a thing. Talk to the boss.
    537532|00000000||You mad?
    537533|00000000||You'll not leave here alive! At him, boys!
    589932|00000000||Run, run, ya bum!
    589933|00000000||And never come back!
    537528|00000000||Whatcha lookin' for, git?
   1052378|00000000||Dammit… where's that delivery? It was to be here a week past.
   1052380|00000000||This caravan, was it to travel through the hills to the east, other side of the river?
   1052382|00000000||It was…
   1052384|00000000||Well, then there's no point in waiting.
   1052386|00000000||Why do you say that? Are there bandits in those hills?
   1052388|00000000||Worse. A beast. And not some nekker, but one that can toss a horse, wagon and driver.
   1028771|00000000||Wanted to play cards. Doubt we need to wait till tomorrow.
   1028770|00000000||Hoping for a round of cards.
    422197|00000000||So long.
    422191|00000000||Farewell.
    422189|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    422195|00000000||Lemme see, might pick something.
    422193|00000000||What can I do you for? If I ain't got it today, say the word and I'll have it tomorrow!
    425333|00000000||Looking for the owner.
    425335|00000000||Owner in? Something I gotta talk to him about.
    425337|00000000||I'm all ears.
    440356|00000000||Wanna talk to Whoreson Junior, not you.
    440358|00000000||Bernie! Dusty!
    440360|00000000||This one's looking for the boss! You have your orders!
    440352|00000000||Wanna talk to Whoreson.
    455920|00000000||Farewell.
    455922|00000000||I'll come back later.
    455924|00000000||As you wish.
    455950|00000000||Farewell.
    440354|00000000||I'll look for a free table.
    440362|00000000||It's all right. I'll look for a free table.
    440364|00000000||Splendid idea.
   1069059|00000000||The gaming tables are upstairs.
    425347|00000000||Hankering to play. But I'm only interested in high stakes.
    425349|00000000||I don't know you. Perhaps you have coin, perhaps not. Perhaps you can behave, perhaps you cannot.
    425351|00000000||Stay out of trouble and you'll eventually play for high stakes.
    455948|00000000||For now - plenty of tables for commoners upstairs. Don't lose it all too quickly.
    425331|00000000||Looking for a high-stakes game. Any going on here?
    425293|00000000||May I?
    427320|00000000||Why not?
    367171|00000000||If you've the coin, play as much as you will. If not - there's the door.
    425299|00000000||Strange bird. Who's that?
    425301|00000000||I'm here each day and I've not seen him.
   1036900|00000000||Door won't hold the beasts in for long.
   1036901|00000000||What'll happen when they burst out?
   1036902|00000000||Rather not think on what'll happen when they tear down the barn.
   1052462|00000000||You hear her wailing yesterday? What did they do to that woman?
   1052464|00000000||Same as always. Started with her fingernails. Ended with breaking her bones.
   1052466|00000000||I… I can't take this anymore. End of this watch, I'm putting in for a transfer.
   1052468|00000000||Calm down, Piet. They're just witches.
   1052470|00000000||Maybe. But they scream like you and me.
   1072306|00000000||Exceptional, truly exceptional… This must date from Falka's time! Oh, earlier still!
   1038023|00000000||It's locked.
   1038024|00000000||I've got the key right here. Father began building this house for Bernie, but ran out of coin. It's been standing half-finished since.
   1038025|00000000||Wonderful hiding place for whatever destroyed your hives.
   1038026|00000000||I'm going in. You go home and bar your door. Who knows what might come out of there…
    581221|00000000||Hah, who would've thought…? Thank you for a game well-played.
    435156|00000000||Why have you come here?!
   1018040|00000000||I've never seen you here before…
    392738|05dc6a8f||Ghost
    396543|00000000||Leave me be…
    396549|00000000||Another word out of you, and I'll take you upstairs.
    427171|00000000||No!
    508168|00000000||Geralt, come here! I've found the mask!
   1057764|00000000||Yennefer, watch out! Get back! Lemme do what I need to do!
   1057766|00000000||I shan't leave you with this! We'll defeat them together!
    478167|00000000||Laboratory worthy of an imperial alchemist.
    477518|00000000||A goat carved out of linden wood. Signed: "To Uncle Ermion."
    478301|00000000||Little Ciri's handiwork. That's what she called him when he was her tutor.
    477508|00000000||Letter bearing Ermion's seal… To the druids. Warns them about you.
    478279|00000000||"…that brazen manipulator?"
   1060210|00000000||Hrmph. The shameless schemer.
    506856|00000000||Ermion enjoys jests achieved at the expense of others. I've a sneaking suspicion the mask will be in here.
    477541|00000000||Ermion's wand. He's one of the few druids to use one.
    477485|00000000||Ah, our dear druid's laboratory. We must search it thoroughly. The Mask of Uroboros must be here.
    506729|00000000||Pine cone. Didn't expect this. A large female.
    506550|00000000||Amazing how a hobby can render a man mysterious, fascinating.
    508652|00000000||Especially a druid. Must be a real nature lover.
    506668|00000000||Strange. Smells of… mushrooms in here.
    506669|00000000||No… To my mind it's the scent of sweet grass drying in the sun.
    506718|00000000||Dwarven triple mead.
    506725|00000000||Goes in for light reading too. "The Corpse of Novigrad" by Sasha Hahdy.
    506727|00000000||A child's skull?
    506609|00000000||A hunter'd loose an arrow if he saw that in the woods.
    506608|00000000||Had one at Kaer Morhen.
    508656|00000000||Please.
    506482|00000000||Seen uglier sights in my life.
    506483|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, being romantic.
    509981|00000000||Help me, Geralt!
    508489|00000000||That's one less!
    506764|00000000||Statue's hand looks like it should be holding something.
    499347|00000000||I'll lock the entrance. We don't want to raise suspicions.
    499345|00000000||Let's go inside, Geralt.
    506607|00000000||Looks alive.
    507157|00000000||A sword in a stone… Thing's begging me to pull it out.
    507158|00000000||It's not in the stone, don't you see? It's held there by a vise.
    506713|00000000||"Wondrous World of Insectoids," "Ritual Plants"… Ah, what do you know - "Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced."
    506666|00000000||Monsters… Can feel 'em… Coming closer… They're everywhere.
    506610|00000000||A basin of water…?
    506611|00000000||For teleprojection.
    508663|00000000||A reflection of Ermion appears on the surface, supplicants speak to it.
    506910|00000000||Cast a spell.
    506911|00000000||I cannot! The room is shielded.
    506909|00000000||It's a trap! We're imprisoned!
    477492|00000000||Skelligers' tales about the Wild Hunt…
    478269|00000000||The islanders believe the wraiths sail on a longship built of the claws of dead men.
   1071134|00000000||Geralt. Hear that?
   1071136|00000000||Smelled it. Gas.
   1071140|00000000||Grate's still closed. Gotta think of something quick.
    506715|00000000||Look at this - a detailed map of the Northern Kingdoms. Even shows spheres of influence over the ages…
    520646|00000000||Out of date.
    506420|00000000||That was close.
    508601|00000000||Mhm.
    506328|00000000||Footsteps!
    506717|00000000||Seems Ermion has real tobacco brought in.
    578372|00000000||I'm curious - you play gwent?
    578373|00000000||Certainly. Though for high stakes exclusively, of course. In fact, the game would be exceedingly boring without the risk.
    578378|00000000||We'll play, a little later.
    578364|00000000||Some other time.
    578363|00000000||Let's play.
    578379|00000000||Up for a round?
   1042596|00000000||Why yes, let's play.
    578362|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
    578380|00000000||I fail to understand how I lost that. Hmph, I believe this card belongs to you.
    578381|00000000||Know any other players willing to stake rare cards?
   1076531|00000000||In Novigrad, Sigi Reuven's collection is famous. You really should challenge him.
   1014614|00000000||Well, hard luck. I'll gladly play you again some time.
    578382|00000000||A druid, Ermion of Skellige. And in Novigrad, well, Sigi Reuven's collection is quite famous.
    166486|ca49f862||Sjusta
   1068617|00000000||Welcome, sir. We trust our charms and skills will prove to your liking. What is it you wish?
   1068619|00000000||I remember you. And I'm glad you've returned.
   1068627|00000000||I'm tired. Like to relax with a beautiful woman. Preferably an elf.
   1071731|00000000||You've chosen well.
   1068608|00000000||Like to relax.
   1068625|00000000||Take care of yourself. Might be back.
   1068610|00000000||Take care.
   1068609|00000000||You're an elf.
   1068623|00000000||You're an elf.
   1071721|00000000||Easily recognized. I'm proud of it, never thought to conceal it in any way.
   1071723|00000000||From what I know, elves in Novigrad aren't exactly treated in a civil manner.
   1071725|00000000||That's putting it lightly.
   1071729|00000000||But this is not the place to discuss that. You've come seeking pleasure, not to hear out complaints.
   1068621|00000000||Hmmm… Greetings.
   1068615|00000000||Greetings.
   1068629|00000000||Nice to see you.
   1056039|00000000||Whores only ever go in. Not one's come out!
   1056041|00000000||Boss's got a voracious appetite. I hear 'em squealin' like sows bein' slaughtered.
   1056043|00000000||Ah, I could do with a little fleshy diversion myself.
   1056045|00000000||Mhm, yeah…
    426163|00000000||Found Ingrid Vegelbud's servant yet?
    426165|00000000||Yes, he's waiting for us. Let's hurry.
    421185|00000000||Talked to Ingrid Vegelbud's servant?
    424787|00000000||Not just yet.
    444331|00000000||Grab 'im!
    371515|00000000||We're set to go. Anytime.
    416587|00000000||On your mark, we rush in.
    416589|00000000||High time we taught Whoreson who's boss.
    417121|00000000||Waiting for me?
    418844|00000000||Och aye, guv. Cleaver sent us over to help. On your mark, we go in and gut the buggers.
    418846|00000000||No buggers left to gut. Took care of 'em on my own.
    418848|00000000||Bugger me! All on your own?
    417123|00000000||Hear that?! Nowt for us here! Off we go!
    371535|00000000||Ready?
    371537|00000000||Righto. We go on your mark.
    371539|00000000||Wait for it.
    371541|00000000||Not too long, eh?
    371525|00000000||Let's wait.
    371523|00000000||Let's go.
    371527|00000000||Let's go, then.
    371529|00000000||Pfft.
   1055653|31c17949||Raven
    466381|00000000||Leave me be. Your breath - uh, the stench of rotted teeth and vodka.
    466383|00000000||But I won't plough you with me mouth, sweetheart! So, what's it gonna be?
   1028756|00000000||How about a card game?
    421172|00000000||Farewell.
    421170|00000000||What're you selling?
    421174|00000000||Show me what you sell.
    421168|00000000||Milk, freshly curdled milk! Eggs straight from the coop, nary a trace o' shit on 'em!
   1045655|00000000||We're about as useful here as knickers are on a whore.
   1045651|00000000||Yearnin' for the dungeon? Interrogate witches all day - is that what you want?
   1045653|00000000||Well, here we're pricks standing to attention with naught to do. I'd be of some use there.
   1047742|00000000||That ginger sorceress's been sighted near the port. Who knows, we could run into her.
   1047744|00000000||Heh! Then you could use her as you see fit.
   1054280|00000000||Oi, cutter. You're a hero now.
   1044128|00000000||Ledger might be worth snooping around for.
   1075576|00000000||You've still Smithy to fight. Don't put it off.
   1046967|00000000||You've still Smithy from the Inn at the Crossroads to defeat, then Fishgulper from Lindenvale - leave you to guess what he does.
   1075578|00000000||Stan Fishgulper remains. Defeat him. Got to it.
    516476|00000000||If you want to be champion, go to Crow's Perch and ask for the sergeant. Or try your strength in Novigrad - they fight there, too. Same in Skellige.
    515909|00000000||Drifter's defeated Jonah! Could this be a new champion of Velen in the makin'? Who can tell?
    515907|00000000||The drifter's lost! Will he return to test his mettle against Jonah once more?!
    515908|00000000||Anytime, now even!
    551095|00000000||Try not to get into any arguments, can you? They've all come here to help.
    595540|00000000||Gonna tell me how to behave, now?
    595542|00000000||No. Just asking you nicely.
    596054|00000000||How's this for a nice answer: kiss my ass. Sheesh.
    551077|00000000||Try not to argue with anyone, can you?
    595528|00000000||Holding up all right?
    595530|00000000||Love questions like that. Am I holding up? What? My dick? This is shit, Geralt, and you know it.
    595532|00000000||Knew the old man couldn't live forever. Huh, even told Eskel that when it came time, I'd get his sword. Fits my hand perfectly, you know.
    595534|00000000||But… Vesemir deserved a better death. Whereas he died like a louse - crushed.
    595536|00000000||We'll avenge him.
    595538|00000000||Doesn't look that rosy to me.
    551078|00000000||How you holding up?
    595548|00000000||You haven't changed a lick.
    595550|00000000||That disappointment I hear?
    595552|00000000||No. Surprise, maybe. Most grow gentler with age. Seems you're growing pricklier.
    595554|00000000||Mom always said I was different.
    595556|00000000||Had some other adjectives in mind, but… different'll do.
    551079|00000000||Haven't changed a bit.
    477153|00000000||See you later.
    477154|00000000||Yeah, take care.
    477150|00000000||See you.
    477149|00000000||Nice to be together again.
    477151|00000000||Nice to be together again, wouldn't you say?
    477152|00000000||Mhm. Just missing Ciri.
    551083|00000000||Thanks for reminding me.
    551085|00000000||I had to change the subject. Heard a sentimental sob making its way up from your gut. Any idea why she's returned?
    551087|00000000||Hhh, shortest version… she's running from the Wild Hunt.
    551091|00000000||Woo. Damn.
    551093|00000000||Going gets tough and you need help, you can count on me.
    477146|00000000||Can we talk?
    477147|00000000||What about?
   1020715|00000000||Take care.
   1020606|00000000||So long.
   1050947|00000000||You and Dudu know each other well?
   1050949|00000000||You and Dudu - know each other well?
   1050951|00000000||Yes. Though he's never told me much about himself. He was a merchant once?
   1050953|00000000||Mhm, Dudu always had a penchant for enterprise. Probably too honest to succeed in Novigrad, though.
   1050955|00000000||Precisely. I've told him countless times that no matter how many times he changes his appearance, the good in him will always emerge.
   1050957|00000000||Blood-thirsty tyrants and vicious assassins - he played them so poorly. That must be why.
   1050959|00000000||Whereas he always made for an excellent Trusted Servant or Ghost of the Old King.
    340839|00000000||Ah, so good to see you.
   1080238|9f3db5f2||Gargoyle
    550496|00000000||Splendid. Sigi Reuven awaits in the next room.
    488281|00000000||Busy with what?
    488291|00000000||Busy? With what?
    488293|00000000||Entertaining important guests.
    488295|00000000||In that case, tell him there's another one at the door. Geralt of Rivia. And I'm not leaving till I see him.
    487565|00000000||Sigi Reuven cordially invites you to join him. I'm Happen.
    487573|00000000||The meeting is in the baths. We will pass through the dressing room, so you can leave your clothes.
    487574|00000000||Let's go.
    488297|00000000||Teeheehee. Very well, I shall try. Please wait.
    488283|00000000||Tell him Geralt of Rivia wants to talk to him.
    488285|00000000||I cannot promise Mr. Reuven will have time to see you.
    488287|00000000||Wanna bet?
    488280|00000000||Don't care.
   1068238|00000000||Anybody there?! Open up!
    487536|00000000||What's the fuss? The bathhouse is closed.
    487561|00000000||Need to talk to the owner. I know he's here.
    487562|00000000||I'm not sure that matters, as he's terribly busy.
    445483|00000000||If I might be allowed a comment, sir - it's not commonly accepted in this city to stroll about nude.
    460064|00000000||I 'd advise you to don some clothing.
    550493|00000000||You may disrobe here. Your equipment will be safe.
   1041951|00000000||Ye-e-e-essss!
   1041953|00000000||Curb your enthusiasm, mate. And sit still or you'll hurt yourself.
   1041958|00000000||But… but he won!
   1041967|00000000||So? Now we'll play somethin' else.
   1039396|00000000||Hmmm. Well, that's it for Ravvy…
   1041956|00000000||Your turn, shitbag!
   1022736|00000000||Ah, here's Fringilla.
   1053594|00000000||I've buried my whole family. Black Ones killed my son, lost my wife to dysentery…
   1053596|00000000||You got to bury your loved ones, at least. Don't even know where mine are rottin'.
   1053598|00000000||We were fleein' the fightin', pitched camp in the woods. I took my sling, went out to hunt down some supper.
   1053600|00000000||Came back after dusk with two hares… No one there to greet me. Not my wife, not my gran, not my daughter.
   1053602|00000000||Some demon must've caught wind of 'em…
   1053604|00000000||Naye. Humans. Footprints all about. And blood.
    481602|00000000||What did you expect me to do? Chop his legs off at the knees? Didn't even know what he was after…
    484142|00000000||Think someone let somethin' slip?
    484156|00000000||If Big Willy got pissed again and went to jabberin' about the workshop…
    484158|00000000||And just who'd he get pissed with? Witch hunters? Even Big Willy's not that daft.
    484160|00000000||By the by… how'd he get that nickname? I mean, he's even short for a dwarf…
    484214|00000000||Think they'll confiscate the paintings?
    484216|00000000||They'll never find them all.
    491270|00000000||Argh, who the fuck's this now?
    173764|00000000||A fisherman's hut. Seems she wants me to take a closer look.
   1026567|00000000||Same stuff as last time?
   1026569|00000000||I have something better. Pure fisstech - at a special discount for an officer of the law.
   1026571|00000000||Discount? Do you jest? Give me what you've got if you ever wish to deal around here again.
   1026573|00000000||And, uh… my coin?
   1026575|00000000||No coin today. Punishment for your greed.
   1053702|00000000||Been thinkin'… Know who started this war?
   1053704|00000000||Nilfgaard, o' 'course. They's the ones violated the border first!
   1053706|00000000||That's not it at all. It was the nonhumans.
   1053708|00000000||It's imperial soldiers sittin' 'cross the Pontar in black plate. Not dryads.
   1053710|00000000||And who forged that plate? Dwarven smiths. Who paid for it? Dwarven bankers like our Vivaldi.
   1053712|00000000||And when'd the war start? The summit at Loc Muinne - a sorcerer city. And among sorcerers, well, we all know there's elves in abundance.
   1053714|00000000||True… Ida Emean, for one, Francesca Findabair, for another… And that Yennefer of Vengerberg, heard even she's one-quarter elf.
   1053716|00000000||Perhaps you're not talkin' rubbish after all…
    493640|00000000||This is no game.
    493648|00000000||The way you play, well, it's only ever fun for you.
    493650|00000000||That's 'cause you're a dullard. All you humans are dullards!
    484890|00000000||Now go wake that sleepyhead. I won't stop her, she'll get up.
    493668|00000000||Sarah, Novigrad's no place for a godling, but if you want to live here, that's your business. So let's make a deal.
    493670|00000000||A deal? What kind?
    493672|00000000||Leave the dreamer alone. In exchange, I'll tell the banker the house is haunted - for good, no way to lift the curse.
    493674|00000000||You'd tell him that? What if he doesn't believe you?
    493677|00000000||I'm a witcher. He'll believe me.
    501532|00000000||Yes, yes, yes! Do that and I promise not to bother your friend. Not even a little. You're awfully nice, you know?
    501533|00000000||I don't hear that often. Thanks.
    493665|00000000||Let's make a deal.
    498272|00000000||See now, wanna do this the nice way, but you just won't let me…
    500444|00000000||What'll you do to me, eh? Eh? Eh?
    500446|00000000||Burdock - godlings hate the scent. How would you like a whiff?
    493666|00000000||Guess I'll have to throw you out, then.
    493652|00000000||You give the dreamer nightmares, and won't let her wake up. Why are you tormenting her?
    493654|00000000||I'm not tormenting anyone. Scary dreams are great. What I love is when this big 'en chases me. Hen's got these red…
    493656|00000000||Why do you live in a haunted house?
    493658|00000000||Tell you a secret. The house ain't haunted, not one bit! I just pretend it is, make everyone think that. It was sittin' there all empty, so I moved in.
    493660|00000000||Bigwig from the bank then came and bought it. I don't like bankers, 'specially not to live with, so I decided to give 'im a scare.
    493662|00000000||Gave the banker a really big scare. See, he paid a lot for this house and won't give it up easily. Which is why you need to find another home.
    493664|00000000||I don't want to! I don't! I won't!
    493642|00000000||You're lucky. I know you're a harmless godling. But others might not know, and then…
    493644|00000000||And how d'you know I'm a godling, eh? How's that, eh? Eh?
    493646|00000000||If it looks like one and acts like one… Trust me, you're a godling.
    493639|00000000||I know what you are.
    493632|00000000||Boo!
    484178|00000000||Did I scare you?
    493636|00000000||Scared you, didn't I? Can tell you was scared. A big brave man scared of wee little Sarah. Ain't that funny!
    484179|00000000||I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you, Sarah. You might scare someone so bad they'll hurt you.
    484201|00000000||Why would someone hurt me? Havin' a spot of fun's not allowed anymore?
   1046731|00000000||What're you playing?
   1046733|00000000||That lady fell asleep, and I've sent her some horrible dreams. I'll not her wake, neither. I can do that, you know. Funny, isn't it?
    484699|00000000||Very funny. Thing is, I gotta talk to the dreamer, so I'd like you to let her wake up.
    484700|00000000||Little Sarah doesn't want her to wake. Little Sarah wants to play.
    547644|00000000||Strange… Nekkers rarely venture anywhere alone.
    547288|00000000||Someone kept it in a cage… Hm, bars were sawed through, that's why it escaped.
    420904|00000000||See Dandelion after the… fungus incident?
    420906|00000000||No. I even considered granting him another chance… His heart of hearts is pure gold, he simply needs a bit more discipline in his life.
    420969|00000000||But he never came back to see me, so I thought if it's done, it's done.
    186385|00000000||See him later?
    361147|00000000||Thanks for your help. Farewell.
    361138|00000000||Farewell.
    186383|00000000||He wrote a poem about you.
    186393|00000000||Found a poem Dandelion wrote about you. Portrayed you as an unusually talented individual.
    419876|00000000||Really...? Did he mention my poetry?
    186395|00000000||Horses have always fascinated me. I've always longed to extoll their noble beauty… Did you see any of my work at Dandelion's? Mere exercises, true, but I'd be curious to know what you thought of them.
    501487|00000000||Uhh… No, no, didn't see any.
    419880|00000000||"Gee-up! Her snakely whip rose skyward. Gee-haw! Crack! She reined the beast in!"
    501489|00000000||"The stallion danced betwixt her thighs! Lather bathed its chinny-chin-chin."
    498419|00000000||Sorry, don't know much about poetry…
    498356|00000000||Way to put me on the spot.
    498358|00000000||Thanks. That was an ordeal. Think I'd rather face a swarm of nekkers than a class of 10-year-olds.
    498370|00000000||The ratcatcher had no objections.
    498377|00000000||Oh, yeah - how's he feeling?
    498378|00000000||He's dead. Bubonic plague, it seems - I didn't want to upset the children… But you wished to speak of Dandelion.
    492559|00000000||Excuse me. I'm looking for Marabella.
    492560|00000000||I am she. Wait outside, class is in session.
    492566|00000000||I'll wait.
    492567|00000000||It won't take long.
    492562|00000000||Fine, I'll wait.
    492561|00000000||Can't wait.
    492563|00000000||Sorry, can't wait. Here about Dandelion. I'm Geralt, and I'm--
    492564|00000000||Geralt? I know you.
    498070|00000000||Fine, if you're eager to join in the lesson, you're welcome to.
    492565|00000000||Children, sadly the ratcatcher has a fever today, but in his stead we're honored to welcome a witcher, who will now tell us about his trade.
    498084|00000000||Uhh… But…
    498086|00000000||Yeah!
    498088|00000000||This is grand!
    498093|00000000||You shan't disappoint them, will you?
    498119|00000000||So, who would like to ask the first question?
    498125|00000000||Me! What's it mean that witchers are lech'rous?
    498239|00000000||It means that due to our mutations, we have an over developed libido.
    498241|00000000||Libby dough?
    498243|00000000||When a girl likes a witcher, the witcher says "What'll you give me for killin' a monster?" And she says: "Anything you want," so the witcher says: "Heheh - then you'll gimme somethin' you weren't expectin' at all."
    501176|00000000||And that's where little witchers come from.
    498104|00000000||We've got a huge libido.
    498246|00000000||Hmm… how old are you again?
    498251|00000000||Nine!
    501296|00000000||Uuhh…
    498253|00000000||Eight!
    498254|00000000||In that case, wait a few years and I'll tell you.
    498198|00000000||Tell you in a few years.
    498103|00000000||Just a rumor.
    501294|00000000||You shouldn't listen to everything people say about--
    498214|00000000||Means they go to sleep early.
    498215|00000000||Oh, so that's why mum went to tuck that witcher in!
    492582|00000000||Children! What's the meaning of this?! Next question.
    492583|00000000||Is it true witchers kill kings?
    498315|00000000||Don't believe everything they say about witchers…
    498316|00000000||What 'bout animals? They don't like you. My mum says animals don't like bad folk.
    498321|00000000||Tomcat ever hiss at you?
    498317|00000000||You stoled many kids?
    498274|00000000||Don't believe the rumors.
    498322|00000000||No. It's not true.
    498326|00000000||He's a liar.
    498328|00000000||He ain't a liar, witchers don't lie.
    498329|00000000||They can lie because they're not knights. When you gotta kill a dragon, you summon a knight. But if there's a zeugling in the trashheap, the knight won't wanna go, so you gotta call a witcher…
    498319|00000000||It's utterly false.
    498273|00000000||When they deserve it…
    498305|00000000||A man cursed, who's turned into a monster, a witcher might have to kill.
    498306|00000000||Even if he's a king.
    498308|00000000||So King Foltest was a monster?
    498311|00000000||What's it like to cut off someone's head?
    501638|00000000||Can you show us how to cut off a head?!
    501640|00000000||Can we try your potions?
    492586|00000000||Enough! That is all for today. Gather your things and I shall see you in the morning.
    498347|00000000||Yeah!
    498344|00000000||Bid farewell to Master Geralt.
    492587|00000000||It's great you came.
    498345|00000000||Hmph. I'da rather had the ratcatcher…
    492588|00000000||So please do tell me - why are you here?
    498355|00000000||I'm looking for Dandelion.
    492589|00000000||Now can we talk?
    503796|00000000||Yes. What do you want?
    498382|00000000||I know you saw Dandelion recently.
    498383|00000000||Oh yes. Longest afternoon of my life.
    498387|00000000||He read you his poems?
    498389|00000000||No. We perused the Illustrated Guide to Fungi.
    498394|00000000||Hmm… Maybe… Nope. Won't even try to guess why he wanted to do that.
    498396|00000000||Mold - that was his interest.
    498398|00000000||When his hand abandoned my knee to point at a figure of penicillium, I knew the fire between us had died, permanently.
    513586|00000000||Wanna hire this ship.
    513658|00000000||How much would it cost me to hire this ship?
    510102|00000000||The "Harmony of Nations" ain't for hire. Ship's owners got plans for it.
    510394|00000000||There anyone in Novigrad who'll take me to Skellige?
    510104|00000000||Tsk, you mean anyone here off their gourd? Aye, Wolverstone. Goes by the name of Flask. Ask at the Golden Sturgeon.
    513835|00000000||Man's a sheep bugger, like the Skelligers. Sure they get along great.
    510183|00000000||I'm Skellige bound. Need to get there.
    510184|00000000||Start swimmin'. Islanders, the Black Ones - all attack us in those waters. No one sails the route these days.
    510185|00000000||Come on. Clans are ready to deal, leave you alone if you do. Someone's done it, gotta have.
    510186|00000000||Not likely. 'Cept maybe that daft bastard Wolverstone from the "Atropos." A liar, a thief and a bugger, that one. He mighta parleyed with the sea-swine.
    513660|00000000||Hm. Where can I find him?
    513662|00000000||In a pigsty, most times. Others - the Golden Sturgeon. Ask for Flask - everyone knows 'im.
    513585|00000000||Need to get to Skellige.
    513588|00000000||You captain of this tub?
    513590|00000000||What's it to you?
   1044836|00000000||Can't hold on, can't hold on no longer…
   1044838|00000000||White One, help us…
   1044840|00000000||Ehh…
   1044842|00000000||They've got medicine! They do! Why don't they help us?! Why?!
   1044844|00000000||Aaaah! Aaaah!
    373501|00000000||I'll wait here.
    577063|00000000||You want to get involved?! Wish granted.
   1086501|00000000||All right, so let's play cards.
    422187|00000000||So long.
    422183|00000000||Farewell.
    422181|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422185|00000000||What's on the menu today?
    422179|00000000||Welcome to the Seven Cats, the luckiest tavern in town.
    498545|00000000||They say even the hangovers our wine begets are lucky!
   1072850|00000000||Geralt! Over here! Got her!
   1056601|00000000||Geralt! Careful, she's strong!
    338912|9f754b64||Blacksmith
    595218|00000000||Nice mounts…
    595220|00000000||Gotta be worth more than the entire village.
   1063422|00000000||Coming to get you!
    473426|00000000||Over here! Can't get out! Roof's collapsed!
   1045554|00000000||Akh akh… Help me! Akh. Do somethin'!
   1045556|00000000||Door! Akh akh… Open the door!
    473432|00000000||Akh akh. Horses! Gotta let 'em out! Open the main door!
    473632|00000000||Remember me?
    473634|00000000||Stable hand. Pulled you out of the fire.
    473636|00000000||Won't ever forget that. Here, I'm grateful.
    473648|00000000||Thanks, mate.Akh… You saved my sorry arse. Thought I'd roast for sure.
   1045649|00000000||Good work!
    452676|35f90f2a||Shepherd
   1004347|00000000||Sent my young'uns to pick mushrooms yesterday.
   1004348|00000000||To the woods? Alone?
   1004349|00000000||You know how it is - had too many mouths to feed…
   1004350|00000000||What kind of mother are ye?!
   1004351|00000000||More food for the rest now…
   1010845|00000000||Murderers! Help!
   1010843|00000000||At your service.
   1010840|00000000||Greetings. Nice day, isn't it?
   1010838|00000000||Oh, it's a lovely day today.
   1010830|00000000||Hm, nothing special.
   1010822|00000000||Oh, be damned.
   1010818|00000000||Ha, I believe I see a rainbow.
   1041436|00000000||Need to find out what the Hunt's doing here.
    567235|00000000||I gotta know what the Wild Hunt's doing here.
    567238|00000000||But we came to find the elven mage, not fight the Hunt!
   1041480|00000000||If they reach him first, we won't get a chance to talk to him. Besides--
    567242|00000000||Go on, finish. Wait, you've some special interest in the Hunt… Is this about Ciri? There's something you've not told me, isn't there?
    567244|00000000||Come with me and maybe I will.
   1041472|00000000||Are you always like this? I'm beginning to feel sorry for Triss and Yen.
   1059153|00000000||Oh very well. Let's go.
    567222|00000000||Scared? Go back. I'm gonna keep going.
    567225|00000000||If you're scared, turn back. I'm gonna go on.
   1041438|00000000||Stop it! That's emotional blackmail!
   1041440|00000000||You'd really worry about me if I went on alone?
   1041441|00000000||You?! I'd be concerned for myself!
   1041459|00000000||Then come with me. Just… quick decision, c'mon.
   1041464|00000000||Very well, have it your way. How did I ever let you talk me into this ridiculous expedition?!
   1041492|00000000||Let's go. We might still reach the elven mage before they do.
    567246|00000000||But what does the Hunt want from him?
   1041528|00000000||If that elf has information about Ciri… Or if she tried to find him, contact him, even, and they sensed her…
   1041533|00000000||Very well. Let's move on. Perhaps we'll come across some clue, some trace left by this elf.
    567249|00000000||There's no guarantee the Wild Hunt's is going the right way.
    567223|00000000||Let's hurry.
    566756|00000000||Let's go. Wild Hunt got a good head start on us, but we still stand a chance.
    567216|00000000||Have you gone completely mad? We must leave here at once!
    553855|00000000||You that afraid of rats? Could've annihilated them with one spell.
    566821|00000000||Fine, won't say anything… So, what happened to you?
    553856|00000000||There's something here, something that distorts teleportation. I've no idea how they managed to get to the other side problem free.
    592898|00000000||Wild Hunt's teleportation magic is different. Got specially trained mages for that - navigators they call them.
    566838|00000000||They can have three helmsmen and a parrot for all I care. I'll not risk that again.
    381772|00000000||No traces of magic. This was no spell, it was a bomb… Now, why am I not finding pieces of it…?
    383055|00000000||Could be the current swept them away…
    478610|00000000||Bravo!
    391197|00000000||I'll stay here and wait. You go home.
    413994|00000000||I'll wait with you.
    413996|00000000||Out of the question.
   1074074|00000000||But… that's my child. And the guilt, the responsibility for all this lies with me.
   1074076|00000000||Time for parental impulses… it's long past. Besides, nothing else you can do here.
   1074083|00000000||But--
   1074079|00000000||No "buts." Just witcher's work left to do here. Gotta wait a day and a night for the botchling to turn into a lubberkin. That's it.
   1074081|00000000||Go home. And try not to drink yourself stupid again.
    391173|00000000||Agh. What now?
    392753|00000000||In one day's time Dea should turn into a lubberkin.
    180478|00000000||What now?
    180483|00000000||Repeat after me.
   1043879|00000000||By the powers of earth and sky.
    180485|00000000||By the powers of earth and sky.
    180487|00000000||By the world that was to be your home.
    180489|00000000||By the world that was to be your home.
    180491|00000000||Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace.
    180493|00000000||Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace.
    180495|00000000||I name thee - say her name - and embrace thee as my daughter.
    180497|00000000||I name thee Dea and embrace thee as my daughter.
    180499|00000000||Good. Now bury the body.
    421103|00000000||Lemme have a look at your stock.
    421095|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1028786|00000000||How about you take a break from hawking, we play cards, instead?
   1086477|00000000||A round of gwent, perhaps?
    421107|00000000||Ah. So long.
    421099|00000000||Farewell.
    421097|00000000||Can you craft something for me?
    421105|00000000||Need something crafted.
    421101|00000000||You ain't safe 'less you got a "Gabrielle"! The auto-cranked, one-handed "Gabrielle" ensures you'll get the first shot - and the last word!
   1062959|00000000||That bastard hired me on the assumption he wouldn't have to pay me!
   1063378|00000000||Duped and trapped like a child… If not for you…
   1063380|00000000||We need to find Brandon.
   1068551|00000000||Welcome to the Passiflora.
   1068553|00000000||Welcome back to our humble boudoir. How can we help?
   1068555|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
   1071696|00000000||I see. All right, but we've terms to agree first.
   1068547|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
   1068559|00000000||Take care.
   1068549|00000000||Farewell.
   1068548|00000000||How does the Temple Guard treat you?
   1068557|00000000||Can't help wondering how the Temple Guard treats you.
   1071698|00000000||With interest. They come by rather often.
   1071700|00000000||Far as I remember, Church of the Eternal Fire doesn't exactly condone these practices.
   1071702|00000000||The Church is the Church, and men are men. Not much consistency there. Now, tell me what you want.
   1068561|00000000||You're back. How nice.
   1015305|00000000||As you wish, master.
   1015318|00000000||As you wish, Master.
   1015320|00000000||Hah! We'll make someone out of you yet, witcher. Now off with you, shoo!
   1015314|00000000||Will you finally tell me what the ritual's about?
   1015316|00000000||Now now. No one likes a meddler. Suffice to say it's… a burning matter. Now shoo!
   1015304|00000000||Gonna tell me about the ritual?
   1015297|00000000||Did everything you asked.
   1015299|00000000||Phenomenal, my boy. So, Fritjof, shall we begin?
   1015301|00000000||The sooner the better. We've a long night ahead of us.
   1015303|00000000||The ritual is only for members of the Inner Circle. Thus, my dear apprentice, you must wait outside. Under no circumstances must you to enter! We shall begin your tutelage come morn.
   1015323|00000000||Ah! I must have another. That'sh good shtuff!
   1015325|00000000||Aye, idz the best! From Morskogen. And spir't from Hail Hill! Good times, Fritjof, hahaha, good times. Finally, somethin' other than damn potions and transhutations!
   1015348|00000000||Guess the ritual's not over yet.
   1015350|00000000||Geralt! I thought I told you to ssh-shtay outshide! Only druids of the Inner Circle…!
   1015354|00000000||Cricle-shmircle! Let the boy have shome fun. He's earned it.
   1018464|00000000||Hehe, fine! Pour yourshelf shome. Geralt, let the lesshons begin!
   1018472|00000000||Drink hard and study hard. I like the idea.
   1018474|00000000||Yeah, yeah… I call it stimulation and assimilation. First you stimulate, and then - hahaa - you assimilate. Now shit down.
   1018466|00000000||Study hard, drink hard. That's what I like.
   1018465|00000000||Don't wanna sober up first?
   1018468|00000000||Don't you think you oughta sober up first?
   1018470|00000000||Ahh, once I'm shober, we'll get nowhere on account of my hangover. Now shit!
   1018477|00000000||Hehehehe right… Let's shtart with ingesting toxins. Best approach - practice makes perfect.
   1018479|00000000||Mhm. I've practiced a lot already - good thing.
   1018481|00000000||It'll make learning my shecret methodsh eashier. Look… You take the potion like thish… And gulp!
    415943|00000000||I'm new here.
    458502|00000000||Yeah? What happened to Norbert?
    458504|00000000||Cleaver happened to him.
    415945|00000000||Poor sod.
    458506|00000000||Better than to die of consumption… Remember? He looked a bit on the down slope…
    415947|00000000||All right. But next time remember to bring the tarts for Junior through the back, by way of the old canal. Go through there.
    415949|00000000||Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
    415939|00000000||I am new.
    399007|00000000||Uh, must be a misunderstanding.
    458579|00000000||Flank the bastard!
    399003|00000000||Misunderstanding.
    399005|00000000||Mhm. And now I've come for you.
    399016|00000000||Believe I did have the pleasure to meet those two gentlemen.
    399022|00000000||What were the names again? Olgard and Vick?
    399026|00000000||Give them my regards.
    458518|00000000||Wanna see Whoreson.
    458528|00000000||Wanna see Junior.
    415956|00000000||Tut-tut - you people, honestly. Got nerve comin' to the front door. You're brazen, it ain't right.
    458508|00000000||And we aren't stupid, honest. Tell 'im!
    415953|00000000||No. We are not.
    458510|00000000||Let's gut the bastard!
    415958|00000000||Faulty memory. I've been here before.
    415960|00000000||Right cheeky whoreson if I seen one.
    458512|00000000||You're not the first to try the old walk on through…
    458514|00000000||Now, let me show you how we dealt with them.
    415941|00000000||Your memory's shit.
    458520|00000000||Here to talk about the new girls for Whoreson.
    458522|00000000||Never seen you here before.
    458524|00000000||You know him?
    458526|00000000||Can't say I do.
    458516|00000000||Here about the girls.
    441533|00000000||Junior ought to know someone's sniffin' around.
    415863|00000000||I know you, you motherfucker. Saw you kill Olgard and Vick.
    395815|00000000||What do you want?
    441558|00000000||Where's Whoreson Junior?
    441560|00000000||Ooh, this one's got bollocks, don't he.
    415972|00000000||Whores come through the back. How many times I got tell you?
    415976|00000000||Go around back. An' stop ploughin' botherin' me!
   1052217|00000000||Mail ship hasn't made port, either.
   1052219|00000000||It hasn't and never will. Ye awaitin' a letter from your lover, or is it a fat pouch o' coin from family o'erseas? Well, either way you're waitin' in vain.
   1052221|00000000||You're an idgit. I ain't awaitin' nothin'. Just curious what's the delay. Weather's been good, squalls've been passin' us by.
   1052223|00000000||But the imperial armada's not been. And those savages from Skellige venture nearer and nearer our waters.
    363412|00000000||Another trinket.
    363416|00000000||And… a ring… Dandelion's cohorts were either clumsy… or in a big hurry.
    358251|00000000||Yet another shiny bauble…
    363400|00000000||Gold… Probably fell out of one of Dijkstra's crates…
    475212|00000000||In Vizima - now those were balls!
    476641|00000000||Attended a few, me and my Annie!
    476639|00000000||Oh, how we danced! How we twirled! Hahaha!
    476700|00000000||Ooh!
    476702|00000000||One, two, three - one, two, three - wayhey!
    475214|00000000||Enough.
    476718|00000000||I don't care how you do it, but the deliveries must be weekly.
    475216|00000000||Won't you stay for tea?
    475218|00000000||No. Besides, you've another guest.
   1046946|00000000||If you're aiming to be champion of Velen, you've two still to beat: Jonah from Blackbough and a fisherman from Lindenvale, locals call him Fishgulper.
   1075563|00000000||Fishgulper - he's the last bloke left to you.
   1075565|00000000||You've still Jonah to beat. Best of luck.
    516404|00000000||If it's the reignin' champion you seek, head to Crow's Perch and ask for the sergeant.
    515367|00000000||Not bad. Might be champion yet.
    515355|00000000||Push-ups and vegetables, that's what you need. Put some muscle on, then come back.
    499741|00000000||Sure, why not.
    499742|00000000||If I have to. I'm all ears.
    499743|00000000||Warrrrriorrrrrs hrrr came hrr… They knew they could not kill me hrrr hrr… So they laid a trap hrrr… chained me down hrrr… locked me in here… hrrr…
    499744|00000000||Hrrr know what I did? Hrrraa I bit my leg off hrrr to free myself hrrr… Every bite hrr brought pain aaaaaand howling. I vomited blood hrr…
   1075718|00000000||Mhm. Biting off your own limbs hurts - who would've thunk?
   1075720|00000000||You don't understaaaand hrrr… This was morrrrre hrrrr… My mouth burrrrrned hrrrr… like swalllowing firrrrree… As if all inside me was torrrrrrn hrrrraa! Felt I would die hrr hrrr… but I did it. And then hrrr…
    504316|00000000||I shreeeded them hrr dashed them to bits, made tiny crrrumbs hrrr hrrr of those ploughing herrrrroes hrraa!
    504330|00000000||Expect me to pity you?
    504332|00000000||Hrr no. I want you hrrr to underrrstand! Hhrrrraaaa!
    504319|00000000||Expecting pity?
    504318|00000000||Story have a point?
    504322|00000000||Your story have a point, or just doing some chest-pounding?
    504324|00000000||Hrrrr the moral hrrr is hrr…
    504334|00000000||You cannot kill me hrrrr… cannot stop me hrr hrrr… I'll not be bound hrrr brrrreak any feterrrrs!
    504336|00000000||Hrrr the curse hrrr hrrr… free me… or hrrr… I'll returrrn hrr… to get you hrr… again! Hrrrraaaargh!
    504274|00000000||Honestly? Rather just kill you.
    504276|00000000||You know hrr hrr… I will hrr returrrn hrrragh!
    504277|00000000||Don't keep me waiting.
    499740|00000000||Rather just kill you.
    499665|00000000||Hrrr hrrr it grrrrrrew back… hrgh it always hrrr… hrraaa grrrrrows back.
    504252|00000000||Starting to envy you.
    504262|00000000||Hrrr wish to hrrr hear a storrry? Hrrraaa!
    572180|00000000||You're pushin' it, friend.
    572182|00000000||I advise you well. Fuck off.
    572184|00000000||Gonna kill you.
    572188|00000000||Fuck!
    572186|00000000||I'm runnin' outta patience.
   1073281|00000000||The sword. Sheathe it.
   1073283|00000000||That's right.
   1073285|00000000||Your choice, you pleb.
    422924|00000000||What did he want?
    423004|00000000||So what did he want instead of coin?
    438230|00000000||Where'll I find this man?
    438252|00000000||Tell me where he is. Take care of this for you.
    438254|00000000||Cemetery - went there to slay the monster. Hope the corpse eater guts that fornicatin' freak!
    438232|00000000||If he's really a witcher, you don't have a thing to worry about. We can't sire children.
    438234|00000000||Thank the gods - any more of yous and we'd be lost! But this one, he beguiled me daughter, rutted her 'neath me own roof - that I can't forgive!
    438228|00000000||Witchers are sterile.
    422926|00000000||Said for pay he'd take somethin' I had but did not yet know about. Then he left. And 'ere the door swung shut behind 'im, me lass started wailin'. "What's these tears?" I asked. "Oh, I can't bear it," she says, "I'll kill the whoreson!"
    422928|00000000||Go on.
    422930|00000000||Fool girl wept that some beast was gonna kill the witcher dead. "Ye howlin' for a mutant?" I said. Then she tol' me, tol' me: bugger had bewitched her with his evil eye, seduced her! And that were to be his prize: a witcher's bastard!
    423002|00000000||Awfully noble of him.
    438183|00000000||Thought so too, at first.
    422922|00000000||Awfully noble of him.
    438162|00000000||Ye deaf?! Begone, ye blasted mutant!
    422918|00000000||Where's all this hate for witchers coming from?
    422920|00000000||Where? I'll tell ye where! One o' yous came here, ate his fill for two days while he thunked things over. Then he says he'd do us a favor and kill our monster.
    438189|00000000||What's your price, I asked, but he said he wanted no coin, for he saw we'd none to offer.
   1043472|00000000||Hard times we live in, so I wondered if I could, well, have a go for half price?
   1043474|00000000||For half price I'll undress half way.
   1043476|00000000||But you're a regular, so you can choose which half.
   1043478|00000000||Then I choose the front.
   1032876|00000000||We slog away while the aristos frolic. Ballin' and dancin' their lives away… But would any of 'em grab a sickle or a broom? Never.
   1032878|00000000||Aye, Lady Ingrid don't even get out of her dress without her chambermaid's help.
   1032880|00000000||It'll end one day. Won't be no more lords or ladies.
   1032882|00000000||Folk in Velen complained about their lord, too. Ousted 'im. Think they're any better off? I'd shut it if I were you.
   1041642|00000000||So the buyer - who is he?
   1041986|00000000||A friend of a friend. Don't know much about 'im, but he's of Duke's ilk, no doubt about that.
   1041988|00000000||Hmm.
   1041989|00000000||You know me, Geralt. I'm not prejudiced against anyone. Long as they pay.
    453034|00000000||Fang bites.
   1010088|00000000||Lovely rain.
   1010086|00000000||Greetings.
   1010084|00000000||Hey, witcher! How are things?
   1010082|00000000||Hm?
   1010080|00000000||Watch it!
   1010078|00000000||Hide!
   1015177|00000000||Greetings.
   1045661|00000000||Hey, look at that tramp.
   1045663|00000000||Hm, quite the smart jacket for a tramp.
   1047683|00000000||Maybe we could, you know, take it off 'im?
   1047685|00000000||Ugh, bollocks for brains, you've got. Can't you see he's a witcher?
    173424|00000000||You give the child a name?
    173441|00000000||No… Why would we?
    173443|00000000||Mistake. Names are powerful seals.
   1006186|00000000||That's gotta hurt something awful.
    577973|b534b7a5||Noblewoman
    594459|00000000||Wha' you starin' at? A gull shit on me?
    594461|00000000||Rum, rum - time and again. I'd kill for some vodka.
    594463|00000000||Got this sharp pain in me spine.
   1065547|00000000||Something heavy was dragged through here… Bodies?
    459331|00000000||Geeeralt! Coming?
   1030519|00000000||Me mate swears he saw one woman service ten Johns at once! Had 'em yelpin' with joy, every last one!
   1030521|00000000||Mhm. Wonder how many bottles your mate had emptied beforehand. Ten, I wager - one for each John.
   1030523|00000000||He don't drink. He's clergy.
   1030525|00000000||So he don't drink, but he goes to brothels. And that's fine?
   1030527|00000000||What's the one to do with the other?
   1044816|00000000||Long as I live, there's hope.
   1044814|00000000||{*Heavy breathing*}
   1044812|00000000||Sir, you've talked to 'em, the Black'uns, I saw ye! Ask 'em for me… Me daughter's not got the strength to breathe… Make 'em let 'er in!
   1044818|00000000||Water, water…
   1044820|00000000||Murderer!
   1041779|00000000||Go on, Geralt, after 'im!
   1041792|00000000||I'd only slow you down.
    562744|00000000||A crack. Too small to pass through… but big enough for sound to come out.
   1043350|00000000||Looks like the local peasantry decided to convert…
    562743|00000000||Hm, wine… or more like vinegar. Someone drank it anyway. Could follow the scent…
   1084522|d3bd6068||Sigi Reuven's Henchman
   1033272|86973d0f||Redanian Merchant
   1052590|00000000||Let us pray to the Eternal Fire that it may grant our supplications!
   1052592|00000000||Eternal Fire, hear our prayer.
   1052594|00000000||Eternal Fire, hear our prayer.
   1052596|00000000||Eternal Fire, hear our prayer.
   1052598|00000000||Let us pray that the conflagration of war spare our city… our homes… our loved ones!
    426968|00000000||I either go out another way… or ready my sword.
   1068740|00348067||Dog
    577947|00000000||Whatever he saw just before he died… gave him quite a scare.
    577948|00000000||Pale skin, but no blood loss. This is no vampire.
    577949|00000000||Hard-headed men…
    577950|00000000||Expected to see four bodies.
    577951|00000000||Deep, uneven tracks. Someone fled blindly, in a panic.
    577953|00000000||If the Lady's linked to this tower, it's worth a visit.
    577954|00000000||Strange. As if a whirlwind came through.
    577955|00000000||Right. The ghost of a bride-to-be… A noonwraith.
    577956|00000000||Maybe there's a reward for her?
    577957|00000000||Oh, yeah. Noonwraiths never come out after dusk.
    577971|00000000||Gotta toss some mistletoe in the fire, too. Wraith won't come out otherwise.
    578115|00000000||No injuries. Killed by magic.
    591497|00000000||She's avoiding me. Gotta find something that belonged to her, she'll have to show, then.
    577946|00000000||Not a trace of decay. And it's been lying in direct sunlight.
    577952|00000000||Met the same end as the others.
    371481|c38af1d3||Old Man
   1027482|00000000||You hurt her?
   1027487|00000000||So he was trying to avenge his sister?
   1027489|00000000||Aye, though I've no notion why. Didn't force her to do a thing, never hurt her in no way.
   1020996|00000000||A Skelliger seducing a priestess? I thought--
   1027418|00000000||Thought what? That we don't do "such things"? Not every man in the Isles believes that rubbish about the gods. But many can't accept that, and it leads to feuds, vendettas.
   1027483|00000000||It's not right, not fair - I love Irma, and she loves me. There'll come a day we'll be together, I'll find a way. Religion's full of holes as logic's concerned, there's bound to be holes in its principles, too. I'll find 'em, show 'em to the priestesses. Then they'll let me wed my Irma.
   1027484|00000000||You travel a lot, don't ye? Ever come across somethin' that can help me, bring it here. I'll pay ye well. I live in the hut the other side of the volcano.
   1027485|00000000||See what I can do. So long, and try to stay away from brothers in a rage.
   1027481|00000000||Seduce a priestess?
   1020993|00000000||Phew, thanks for the help.
   1020994|00000000||What was that about?
   1020995|00000000||Ah, bugger can't handle that his sister'd rather sail to Lilac Bay with me than serve Freya.
   1027511|00000000||Ah, greetings. Got somethin' for me?
   1027531|00000000||I'm off. Farewell.
   1021003|00000000||Farewell.
   1021002|00000000||Might find this interesting.
   1027247|00000000||Thanks, I think I'm lookin' for somethin' else.
   1021379|00000000||Ever find somethin' that could help me, you know where I'll be.
   1027246|00000000||"Change Your Life! A Handbook for the Stubborn." Heh, oughta come in handy.
   1027245|00000000||"The Cult of Freya." Ah, this I definitely gotta read.
   1027244|00000000||"The Curious Cases of Virtuous Vegga." Don't know what it's about, but I'll gladly give it a read.
   1027243|00000000||"Religion and Life." Yeah… Not quite what I had in mind.
   1027188|00000000||"Tristianna and Isador" - could be useful, thanks.
   1021091|00000000||Thanks for your help. But I'm thinkin' I'll learn no more sittin' here. Time to see the world. Perhaps while I'm on my travels, I can figure out a way to be with Irma.
   1027538|00000000||Good luck.
   1025802|00000000||Me, I like rennets best. Though pippins and bramleys are good, too… So are russets.
   1025804|00000000||There he goes, apples again! As if workin' in an orchard dawn to dusk weren't enough! Let's talk about somethin' else.
   1025806|00000000||With pears, though, anjous are the best. But if it's jam you want to make, it's gotta be concordes, then conferences for compote.
   1025808|00000000||Ugh! Shut it, Kabe, afore I lose my temper!
    508193|00000000||It's damp, it's damp…
    508195|00000000||It's raining, of course it's going to be damp!
    508197|00000000||If he's back in His Royal Majesty's good graces…
    508199|00000000||Does this also mean his corpulent arse will once again grace the advisor's chair?
    508201|00000000||Allow me not to comment on this scandal-mongering.
    510097|00000000||And do you believe Radovid will stop at that?
    510098|00000000||Why ever not?
    508203|00000000||My sincerest regards.
    508209|00000000||The mark of a dangerous guild you wear.
    508221|00000000||His Majesty King Radovid is a stern ruler, but a just one.
    508205|00000000||Long live the king.
    508207|00000000||Mhm?
    508219|00000000||Try not to disturb me.
    508211|00000000||What's this?!
    508213|00000000||Assailant!
    508215|00000000||Nooooo!
    508217|00000000||Eternal Fire, grant me strength.
   1043899|00000000||Help! Robber!
   1012738|00000000||Oh, another one.
   1012734|00000000||Eh?
   1012736|00000000||I never seen so many strangers in my life.
   1012730|00000000||Strangers, more strangers!
   1020524|00000000||Thaff oth thaf way. Whorethon knothed me thooth out.
   1020525|00000000||What? Can't understand a word.
   1020526|00000000||He went thaf way. Thwough them thoors. Kho! Now!
    371281|00000000||What am I to do with Yagna? Poor girl's a-hurtin', don't give milk. And we've another young 'un on the way…
   1041111|00000000||Save us, kind miss.
   1041210|00000000||What'll we do without our Yagna?
   1041212|00000000||Take pity on us, miss.
    581218|00000000||Congratulations. Bit of a shame bein' eliminated in the first round, but so it goes… 'Tis only a game. Havin' a good time - that's what matters.
    500238|00000000||Maybe you're right.
    500244|00000000||You could be right. But only he knows the truth…
    500246|00000000||We're only ever the ones to know the truth about ourselves.
    500248|00000000||Which we share at times with those we hold dear.
    500250|00000000||Even if it's hard to swallow?
    500252|00000000||Even then.
    500254|00000000||Who knows… maybe one day…
    493360|00000000||It's good there aren't bad feelings between us.
    500230|00000000||I was worried about seeing you again. Doubted it could be pleasant…
    500232|00000000||We said everything there was to say six months ago. I don't want to go back to that.
    500234|00000000||I'm not going back to it. It's just… It's one thing to say something, it's another to actually do it.
    500236|00000000||We promised to remain friends. I hope nothing'll change that.
    500262|00000000||Not bad.
    500269|00000000||Not bad…
    500263|00000000||I don't know.
    500271|00000000||Don't know yet.
   1064694|00000000||Such a sharp sense of smell, you should've legged it while you had the chance.
    500288|00000000||I don't generally leg it. Here's what I think you should do. Pay up and march your boys outta here. While there's still time.
    500290|00000000||Don't be ridiculous. I didn't hire a sorceress in order to pay her.
   1063364|00000000||Take my advice, mutant. If it's not your business, stay out of it.
   1063366|00000000||Thanks for the advice, but… I can't take it.
    500284|00000000||Let's agree your friends were never here. Now pay the rest and let's part in peace.
    500286|00000000||You don't set the terms, mutant.
   1063356|00000000||Stay out of it. We're here for the witch.
   1063358|00000000||We're inseparable, see? Afraid you'll have to take us both.
   1063360|00000000||Geralt!
   1063362|00000000||If you say so…
   1063346|00000000||All right. We've talked. Do what you gotta. Just remember… I can't help but get in your way.
   1063348|00000000||Heard enough from this whoreson.
    497491|00000000||As have I. Neither is to leave here alive.
    500292|00000000||If these boys are here to help us kill rats, they're late. You paid up front and got what you paid for. Not half a rodent left in the granary.
    500294|00000000||I paid in advance because I knew I'd recover my coin.
   1063368|00000000||Such is life for sorceresses in Novigrad these days.
   1063370|00000000||I can see that and I don't like it. So here's what I think: the hunters have come, and now can they go.
   1063372|00000000||They'll do no such thing.
    500280|00000000||Well, well… Our lovebirds having themselves a little chat instead of working?
    500282|00000000||The job's done.
   1064690|00000000||Geralt, those are--
   1064692|00000000||I know who they are, Triss.
   1063350|00000000||My friends… begged me to notify them if I encountered a mage, sorceress, what have you. Didn't have the heart to refuse…
   1063352|00000000||It's a trap, Geralt.
   1063354|00000000||This stank from the start.
    500273|00000000||Asking about anything specific?
    500275|00000000||Never mind. I got my answer.
    500265|00000000||She's fine.
    500267|00000000||That's good.
    500261|00000000||She's fine.
    500256|00000000||So, tell me how Yen's doing?
    500258|00000000||How do you know I found her?
    500260|00000000||You didn't answer my question. How's Yen?
    500240|00000000||We all lie sometimes. But lying to yourself is running away, whereas there's really nowhere to run.
    500242|00000000||Sometimes you have to escape just to forget. Your friend might've dwelled on his lost legs. But it's not like by grieving he could've grown another pair.
    500237|00000000||He could've faced the truth.
    500218|00000000||Knew a man once who reacted to everything, especially adversity, by mocking it.
    500220|00000000||Healthy attitude. Must've lived long.
    500222|00000000||Came a day he lost both his legs in battle. He shrugged, said it was better that way - he'd never feel pain in them again.
    500224|00000000||I understand him perfectly.
    500226|00000000||I know. Thing is, he was lying to himself.
    500228|00000000||I think he just didn't have much of a choice…
    493358|00000000||Are you truly, or just pretending?
    497434|00000000||Now we wait for them to scurry away.
    500206|00000000||Interesting method. Never had much luck with rats.
    500208|00000000||Once, I hit one with a fork in complete darkness. Trying to show off my witcher senses…
    500210|00000000||Masterful throw, really. Problem was no one else saw it - how could they in the dark?
    500212|00000000||Hahah. So, what do you think? Rat catcher? It's a long way to fall from being advisor to Temeria's king.
    500214|00000000||I'm just glad to see you safe and sound, and…
    500216|00000000||Reconciled…?
    496052|00000000||So you're Gretka…
    496053|00000000||I am. And you're Geralt.
    496066|00000000||How'd you know?
    496067|00000000||Because you've white hair and a medallion shaped like a wolf. Ciri told me about you.
   1085109|00000000||Found this toy in Ciri's room.
    496850|00000000||Do you know where Ciri is?
    496851|00000000||No. One day I brought her breakfast, and she was already gone. The baron told me she'd left.
    496855|00000000||Didn't ask where she'd gone?
    496857|00000000||I did, but he said I was too little and I wouldn't understand.
    496856|00000000||But Ciri left me a gift.
    496871|00000000||A gift?
    496873|00000000||Yes, this. A green stone.
    496875|00000000||Beautiful as gifts go. Hide it well, don't show it to anyone. It's worth a lot.
    496848|00000000||Do you know where Ciri is?
    496056|00000000||Farewell.
    496059|00000000||Thanks, Gretka. Have fun.
    496060|00000000||But I'm not playin'. I'm helpin'.
    496842|00000000||Farewell.
    496841|00000000||What friend?
    496844|00000000||Ciri wanted to help a friend? Any idea who it was?
    496846|00000000||What do you mean who? Her friend. She said he was in trouble and that she had to save him.
    496822|00000000||You and Ciri talked a bit, didn't you?
    496824|00000000||We did.
    496825|00000000||Did she say where she was going? Or what she came here to look for?
    496827|00000000||She said she was looking for you and a sorceress. But you're here, so I guess she didn't find you.
    496828|00000000||I wonder if she helped that friend of hers…
    496821|00000000||What else did Ciri say?
   1046881|00000000||Found this toy in Ciri's room.
   1046883|00000000||Look familiar?
   1049398|00000000||My top! Where'd you find it?
   1049400|00000000||Ciri's room.
   1046885|00000000||We'd play in her room sometimes. I was sad one day, and Ciri carved it for me. Such a shame she had to leave.
    496068|00000000||Geralt!
   1004902|00000000||Bloody Baron takes care of his own…
   1004903|00000000||Saw it meself. His thugs don't know hunger.
   1004904|00000000||And just how'd you see that? Why'd you even go there?
   1004905|00000000||To plead for me Danny. Thought they might let him go.
   1004906|00000000||Don't be stupid. Probably dead already.
   1012171|00000000||What you starin' at?
   1012173|00000000||Bloede dh'oine...
   1050632|002efcee||Deer
    576610|00000000||Look! Gonzalo de Verceo's poems… Jacob of Varazze's chronicles… It's incredible. Rare first editions only.
    576612|00000000||We'll come back for them later.
    576614|00000000||No, we won't. I leave Novigrad today, remember?
    582078|00000000||I remember. Just having a hard time coming to grips with it.
    576616|00000000||Come on. We should hurry.
    496962|00000000||That it? Real men got more stayin' power than that!
    496961|00000000||My coin's on the fat-arsed feller!
   1006947|00000000||Got the deal of a lifetime for you!
    540913|00000000||Hey, gray hair!
   1068824|00000000||Word is witchers don't never get their fill of ploughin'. Must be somethin' to it if you're back. Am I to strip off my rags?
   1068822|00000000||Here to plough?
   1068818|00000000||That's a bit direct, but yeah… Think we can have some fun.
   1071670|00000000||All right. Come on.
   1068816|00000000||Let's have some fun.
   1068820|00000000||Some other time, maybe.
   1068828|00000000||Take care.
   1068827|00000000||Sounds like you don't like your job much.
   1068830|00000000||Don't like your job much, do you?
   1071672|00000000||I wager many despise what they do for a livin'. My man cleans the catches brought into port. He can bathe half the day yet he'll always stink. My mother fashions pots - hands so calloused you could cut yourself on 'em.
   1071674|00000000||Ten years on my arse is sure to be like… Eh, waste of words. But we all got to make a livin' somehow.
   1071676|00000000||So, you aim to take me or not?
   1068826|00000000||Ah, it's you. The all nighter. Should I unwrap my charms?
    501234|00000000||Vesemir'd say, "Stay out of it"… But Vesemir's not here.
    501230|00000000||Remi Villeroy. You are under arrest for sorcery and conspiracy. Take him.
    501233|00000000||Daddy!
    505200|00000000||I'm Geralt of Rivia.
    505201|00000000||It matters not what you're called, it matters not where you're from. What matters is if you're prepared to fight Captain Mortimer!
    505202|00000000||Already met the captain once.
    505203|00000000||I remember you, mutant.
    516995|00000000||The air grows thick with hostility! Place your bets quick, I shan't be able to hold them back much longer!
    505273|00000000||I'm ready. Let 's do this.
    542512|00000000||Fight!
    542514|00000000||Let's go.
    542516|00000000||Put 'em up.
    542518|00000000||Fight!
    505204|00000000||Ready to fight.
    505266|00000000||I'll be back.
    505206|00000000||Farewell.
    505205|00000000||Who organizes these fights?
    505267|00000000||Who organizes these fights?
    505268|00000000||Tournaments like this have been held in Skellige, Velen and Novigrad for ages. Each region has its own champion.
    517001|00000000||Novigrad's is the Tailor. Defeat Mortimer and you'll gain the right to challenge him.
    542519|00000000||Wanna fight Mortimer again.
    542615|00000000||Be delighted to pummel the sot one more time.
    589458|00000000||Oi! You there!
    438555|00000000||Gaffer, gaffer!
    438557|00000000||What's it now, Sobek?
    438559|00000000||Gaffer, he's a witcher!
    438561|00000000||Sobek…
    438563|00000000||What?
    438565|00000000||Shut it.
   1034360|00000000||Remember the preacher who spoke of witches and witchers? A man you humiliated before his faithful? He asked that we administer a sacrament on his behalf - your last rites.
   1034350|00000000||Over my dead body.
   1034352|00000000||Told you we wouldn't fool him. Well, you're due a beating. It'll just be more of a challenge.
   1034347|00000000||Over my dead body.
   1034354|00000000||This is a misunderstanding… but fine, take them. Though I'll need a receipt, wouldn't wanna lose anything.
   1034357|00000000||Mhm. Drawin' it up for you now.
   1034348|00000000||I will - long as I get a receipt.
    467622|00000000||Geralt of Rivia? Witcher? White Wolf they call you?
   1034346|00000000||You stand accused of offending religious sentiment. We've orders to take you in for interrogation - surrender your weapons.
    550573|00000000||And Junior cut off his hand, then ordered them to shove it up the corpse's arse.
    550574|00000000||And then he sent the body back, offering "a hand extended in peace."
    421156|00000000||Lemme see what you're offering.
    421142|00000000||Show me what you got.
    421158|00000000||Need something crafted. Can you take a look?
    421144|00000000||Would you craft something for me?
   1028752|00000000||Smithing - pretty tiring job… Need a break, maybe, relax a bit? Play a game or two of gwent?
   1028753|00000000||Hm, why not.
   1028751|00000000||How about some cards?
    421160|00000000||So long.
    421146|00000000||Farewell.
    423546|00000000||Any other smiths in Oreton?
    423548|00000000||Any other smiths in Oreton or nearby?
    423550|00000000||Not anymore.
    421154|00000000||Lookin' for the best smith in Oreton? Well, you've found him.
    496365|00000000||No need to explain.
    496402|00000000||After what they subjected you to… No need to explain.
    490286|00000000||You're right… Never mind.
    490292|00000000||You're right… Never mind.
    434717|00000000||Menge burned a sheet of paper.
    490246|00000000||Saw Menge burn a sheet of paper - right before we came in here.
    490248|00000000||Could've been something on it that would've helped us. Argh, too late now.
    490250|00000000||So, there's no way you can recover the note…?
    490252|00000000||Sadly, no. I'm a sorceress, not a miracle worker.
    490296|00000000||Menge's the only one who could've ordered Dandelion's release.
    490298|00000000||Yes… Or someone who looks exactly like him…
    490300|00000000||A doppler?
    490302|00000000||Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt - impersonated the halfling merchant? Dandelion claimed he seemed more real than the original. So much so Vivaldi gave him a loan of several thousand crowns without batting an eye.
    490304|00000000||Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding right now. Priscilla might know something, though.
    490305|00000000||Fingers crossed. Listen, there is one other thing I wanted to talk about. But not here, not now. Come by when you have a moment? I'd appreciate it. All right… we need to get out of here.
    490351|00000000||Don't have much to work with.
    490352|00000000||Maybe breaking Dandelion out's our only option...
    496410|00000000||Breaking Dandelion out's starting to look like our last option…
    496412|00000000||Geralt, you know me… I'm all for finding solutions. I don't give up easily…
    496414|00000000||But in this case, there's no hope, not a shred. No one escapes the dungeons beneath the temple… And no one's ever been broken out.
    496440|00000000||Anyone actually tried?
    496442|00000000||They've tried, Geralt-- I've tried, to be exact. Shortly before you arrived. It almost cost me my life.
    490350|00000000||Nothing but dead ends… We'll need to make do…
    490288|00000000||Yennefer did it. It was the only way we--
    490290|00000000||I'm not Yennefer, Geralt. I never will be. I'm sorry.
    490285|00000000||Yennefer did it once.
    490254|00000000||Could you… revive him?
    490256|00000000||Maybe… If I actually practiced black magic. Haven't sunken that low just yet.
    434836|00000000||Necromancy seems like our only hope.
    434713|00000000||Let's search Menge's body.
    490214|00000000||Let's search his corpse.
    490216|00000000||Right… Could find something that'll help us…
    496547|00000000||He… He'd never have agreed to help us… Even if I…
    496404|00000000||I know. Let's not dwell on this. We should think about what to do next…
    496406|00000000||Dandelion's safe for now… Though out of reach.
    496408|00000000||We don't stand a chance of breaking him out - Temple Isle's impregnable… And Menge's not likely to order his transfer, or anyone's for that matter…
    496400|00000000||What's done is done.
    496364|00000000||We can't undo it.
    496359|00000000||Menge said Dandelion's locked up on Temple Isle. Dungeon right under the temple. He was planning to execute him in Oxenfurt…
    496361|00000000||Also said they'd only let Dandelion out of his cell once Menge gave the order… in person.
    496363|00000000||Shit… I'm sorry, Geralt… I… should've thought it through, but… When I saw him, I…
    496355|00000000||How do I say this… That was just a bit premature.
    496357|00000000||What do you mean?
    496341|00000000||Rushed it a bit…
    496342|00000000||Gotta see to your wounds.
    490161|00000000||I should tend to your wounds…
    490163|00000000||No need. I'm fine.
    490170|00000000||Well… mostly fine. Should heal in time for my wedding.
    490165|00000000||Sorry. Shoulda gotten you out sooner…
    490167|00000000||Don't apologize. I knew what I was signing up for.
    496426|00000000||He say where Dandelion is?
    496428|00000000||Yes… But…
    496431|00000000||Triss…
    522273|00000000||Huh. Set our sights on other fowl, but you'll do just fine.
    522282|00000000||Well, well. Our witch. With a worthy companion.
   1020531|00000000||It can't be! White hair, yellow eyes, slashed face… Just like he said!
    497295|00000000||This is the place. They say dive down here and you'll see the oyster beds all around. Problem is, not all hold pearls… and the black ones are a real rarity. But, search long enough and you're sure to find one!
   1013983|00000000||Ah - so I'm supposed to do the diving?
    497307|00000000||Well, you see… I been infantry all my life, so I'm not one for water. And my lungs ain't what they used to be, so… yeah.
   1013985|00000000||Hm… Customer's always right.
   1072533|00000000||Seen what's happening outside the gates?
   1071305|00000000||What do you mean? Baron left me in command. Told the boys to set things right, put 'em in order, the new order.
   1071307|00000000||They're murdering and pillaging.
   1071309|00000000||That is the new order. And I don't give a flyin' fuck if you like it or not.
   1072523|00000000||Ah, witcher! Greetin's!
   1072529|00000000||Baron's not here. Rode off to find a healer. For the wife, naturally.
   1072531|00000000||I know.
    504626|00000000||Sorry, can't let that happen.
    504859|00000000||Then why'd you bloody free me?
    504861|00000000||To kill you. Once and for all.
    504624|00000000||Can't let you do that.
    504627|00000000||Fair winds and all, but before you go, my reward…?
    504864|00000000||Right… Nearly forgot!
    504866|00000000||Happens often. Too often.
    504868|00000000||Calm yourself. I'm a man of honor. Now listen, you'll go to Novigrad, to the Bits. Find the vulture, the money lender. Tell him Morkvarg sends his regards, and you'll know me to be a generous man.
    504870|00000000||Farewell, then. The sea beckons!
    504625|00000000||My reward first.
    505033|00000000||Ah. I'm free! Ah! Free! At last! Ah!
    505035|00000000||Ooooh! Where's the tavern?! Hah! I could eat a broiled pig - hahahaha! No! A side of beef! Hah. Wash it down with a cask of ale! Haaa... then, to sea! Hahaha! They've forgot me, no doubt! Aha! Well I'll fuckin' remind 'em with a bang! In Novigrad, everywhere! Hah! I'm back!
    173723|00000000||Necrophages had a field day. Still worth a closer look.
   1074219|00000000||Should examine that horse carcass.
   1065491|00000000||Can't cross that… Gotta go down, provided I can open the sluice.
   1067823|00000000||Mechanism looks pretty standard. One lever to choose the sluice gate, the other to work it.
   1010064|00000000||I wonder if the river's rising.
   1010062|00000000||What are you looking at?
   1010056|00000000||You're not welcome here.
   1010060|00000000||Ugh, humans.
   1010058|00000000||Aaaah!
   1052391|00000000||What good was it… This whole voyage…
   1052393|00000000||The Black Ones might take mercy. You gotta keep hopin'…
   1052395|00000000||No hope left. 'Stead o' dyin' at home, I'll die at Nilfgaard's doorstep, like a stray dog…
    546165|00000000||Sure liked to write… Might find something interesting…
   1061459|00000000||Come. We might still catch them.
   1061435|00000000||Ready! Stay close!
    554622|00000000||Come here!
   1018541|00000000||You tend to the monsters! I'll be able to keep them away from me!
    558043|00000000||Bhain'ne calar!
    557822|00000000||Hm, they blocked the passage. Maybe I can try--
   1061452|00000000||Leave it to me.
    554672|00000000||Whew, I'm beginning to think we might make it.
    557821|00000000||It worked…
    554635|00000000||We must close them…!
    567576|00000000||Want me to go…?!
    554636|00000000||I'll do it, just cover me!
    554740|00000000||Just one more.
    554741|00000000||Mhm.
    554637|00000000||Da'arian annoi!
    526899|00000000||Is that you, Geralt of Rivia? And Triss… I did not see you on the guest list.
    526901|00000000||Baroness. We're here as… friends of the family.
    526905|00000000||As am I, yet my name was there, at the very top of the list.
    526906|00000000||Not at all surprising, my Lady.
    526908|00000000||These courtesies grow tiresome quickly. Why are you here?
    526940|00000000||I think you should ask Lady Vegelbud.
    526942|00000000||I shall, believe you me.
    526866|00000000||The Baroness la Valette?
    526873|00000000||Unfortunately.
    526752|00000000||Is it you? I cannot believe this. How dare you show yourself here? I shall speak to Ingrid and…
    526850|00000000||She's the one invited me.
    526852|00000000||Clearly she's not heard enough about you.
   1011413|00000000||You needn't read the manuscript! Just open the sarcophagus, then be on your merry way.
   1011415|00000000||Help me, this damned lid won't budge!
   1027524|00000000||Whoever put it on the sarcophagus was clearly thinking about grave robbers.
   1027526|00000000||Ehhh… You've no idea who I am, have you?
   1027528|00000000||None.
   1027533|00000000||Professor Vairmont Jonne, Oxenfurt University, Faculty of Applied Archaeology.
   1027541|00000000||As a certain ancient map would have it, there's a priceless elven tome in this sarcophagus - the Dar'Ah Manuscript.
   1027542|00000000||It could shed entirely new light on the Aen Elle-Aen Seidhe conflict. So, will you help?
    474547|00000000||We should let him rest.
    474549|00000000||But…
    474551|00000000||It's better this way, trust me.
    474539|00000000||Let's leave him alone.
    535625|00000000||Let's open it.
   1027577|00000000||Let's open it.
   1011673|00000000||If all goes well, I shall start on the prolegomena today. The jaws on those primates from the History Faculty will drop to the ground.
   1045497|00000000||What the-- again?! Do you fucking plan to come knocking once an hour now? Enough!
    474557|00000000||Fine. I'll open it again.
    474541|00000000||All right. I'll wake him.
    474545|00000000||Ugh, I'm ever running into things like that. Well, come on! Open it again!
   1027567|00000000||Why? See an elven manuscript there? 'Cause I sure as hell didn't.
   1027569|00000000||I hadn't the chance to look. Perhaps he enjoys bedtime reading and keeps it under his pillow?
    463636|00000000||Bloede glewynn!
    463638|00000000||Vampire. Probably regenerates here.
    474530|00000000||Just five more minutes…
    474533|00000000||Is it 1358 yet?
    474535|00000000||No…
    474537|00000000||Then fuck off.
    463619|00000000||All right, let's open it.
    463586|00000000||Fine, let's open the sarcophagus.
    463588|00000000||No, I'm sick of elves.
   1027561|00000000||No chance. See ya.
   1011416|00000000||No. I'm sick of elves and their secrets.
   1011420|00000000||Oh! Your specialization in the subject as well?
   1027551|00000000||Yeah, sorta.
   1027552|00000000||We're due to hold a conference about the White Fleet soon, if you'd like to prepare a paper…
   1011447|00000000||Come now, don't make me beg. I must speak to the vampire.
    463691|00000000||Shouldn't have disturbed him.
    426144|00000000||Huh? What's this?
    426154|00000000||Hmmm… Nah, worthless.
    426146|00000000||Ugh… Dammit, Happen, might could sweep the corners sometimes!
    426158|00000000||Tiles falling off again… Mortar's complete shite.
    426152|00000000||More cobwebs than a witch's den…
    594443|00000000||Eh? Whaddaya want?
    594445|00000000||Me wives miss me. Hehehe…
    594447|00000000||Been here, been there. Same shite everywhere.
   1051349|00000000||{Ques'ann alz esse aep Geso? } [What will you do when you return to Geso?]
   1051351|00000000||{An tus y caith a sine anart yn esse tu’bath. } [To start with I'll cast aside these rancid rags and take a bath.]
   1051353|00000000||{Thaë esse ‘ith soorkool aen shaap, alz deinyg aep ithean… } [Then I'll have a bowl of lamb and sauerkraut, and once I'm full to bursting…]

   1051357|00000000||{Y thaë? } [And then?]
   1051359|00000000||{Y thaë, n'esse va notach. } [The rest is not your concern.]
   1051367|00000000||{Eh, ess’vil neu’ceen. Caen a yn boaer’beana… } [Ugh, I could use a poke. Maybe one of the peasant wenches…?]
   1051369|00000000||{N’esse weerstan? Tha allaidhe beannan esse vershilt aep n’esse draga baard. } [Are you so desperate? The only difference between the barbarian women and men is that the former lack beards.]
   1051371|00000000||{Feadhainn.} [Most of them…]
   1004911|00000000||Clogys seems unwell of late.
   1004912|00000000||She told me it were from some rotten meat she had.
   1004913|00000000||Meat? Where'd she get meat?
   1004914|00000000||I don't know, but folk say her man's always goin' where they been fightin'…
    572142|00000000||Huh…
    572144|00000000||Tough times.
    572148|00000000||Unbelievable. You born with a mug like that?
    572150|00000000||Who the fuck are you?!
    572146|00000000||You fuckin' prick!

   1073249|00000000||Fuckin' grab ahold!
   1073251|00000000||Argh, fuck.
   1073253|00000000||Let's see just how tough a cunt you are.
    548710|00000000||Nosy whoreson! Get 'im!
    582225|00000000||A good match to you both. Please remember the tournament rules: no magic, no quarrels.
    582185|00000000||The nearest round's winner will face Count Tybalt himself in the final. Ahem. Finneas and Gerard of Rivia! Achoo!
    582215|00000000||I'll not play a mutant.
    582221|00000000||Are we to understand you forfeit this round? Fine, in that case--
    582223|00000000||No, I'll not swiving forfeit the round. I shall squash him like a louse.

   1024312|00000000||They're yours.
   1041514|00000000||What did they do, exactly?
   1041516|00000000||What did the woman do? Why do you wanna take the child?
   1041518|00000000||Matter for king. Dirgelech. You not know.

    455656|00000000||Hey, sis. That 'im?
   1032767|00000000||State your origin.
   1032769|00000000||Velen. War's on there, sir.
   1032771|00000000||Velen's a hive of witchcraft and superstition. Remember, we catch you engaging in black magic, you'll be interrogated and tried.
   1032773|00000000||Me? Black magic, sir? I'm a simple lumberjack.
   1032775|00000000||Then I don't know what you seek in this city. We've no need for loggers.
   1052513|00000000||These are foul practices! Stop at once!
   1052515|00000000||Dancing on a scaffold, they've gone too far.
   1052517|00000000||I think it's rather entertaining.
   1052519|00000000||People die there.
   1052521|00000000||Exactly. And you can fear death or laugh in its face. I prefer the latter.
    422142|00000000||The best stock in all Novigrad!
    498472|00000000||No need to push - enough for all comers!
    498474|00000000||Uhh… No one to push.
    498476|00000000||Very good. Manners before trade, always.
   1086508|00000000||You play gwent, maybe?
    422150|00000000||Bye.
    422146|00000000||Farewell.
    422144|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    422148|00000000||Lemme have a look…
    498478|00000000||Oh, you again. Welcome back.
    419851|00000000||I don't wanna fight you.
    419858|00000000||Don't have time to give you another lesson.
    422608|00000000||Tis I shall give thee the lesson!
    419856|00000000||Duly heeded. Now show me what you got.
    419849|00000000||Let's get this over with.
    407561|00000000||You again? Want some more? Bruises on your ass heal already?
    407563|00000000||En garde, I say! Victory will be mine this time! I've practiced with shield and sword! Many a headless scarecrow 'round here! Heed my warning and stand and fight!
    504617|00000000||Hrrr better hrrr be trrue… or I'll rrrip you! Shrrred you! Hrr…
    504621|00000000||Aaaaarrrrgh! What-- hrr what did you dooo?!
    504622|00000000||That was your own flesh. Far as I know, curse doesn't allow for that.
    504637|00000000||Hrr aaaarrrrgh!!! Whorrreson! You trrricked me! Deceiverrrr grrrrrr.
    504640|00000000||Hardly. Wanted me to lift the curse? Well, you're welcome.
    504597|00000000||Hrrr said the same hrr hrr… last you werrrre herrre hrrrr…
    504599|00000000||Relax, this is different. This'll work.
    504591|00000000||Have a bite of this. Oughta lift the curse.
   1044758|00000000||Hrrr nooooothing?! Hrrr is this mockerrrry? Hrr hrr think this a diverrsion? Hrrr hrr I catch you again, hrrrrr I'll have rrrrrrreason to laugh hrrr hrr.
    504593|00000000||Could try the meat again…
    504595|00000000||Hrr you hrr fucking try it, hrr you hr prrrrrrick!
    504582|00000000||See if we can do this the easy way. Morkvarg, of my own free will I offer you this fare. Now, dig in.
    504584|00000000||Won't turrrn hrrr to ash?
    504586|00000000||Won't know until you try. C'mon, a spoonful for daddy…
    504589|00000000||Hrrr bleeeugh akh akh… Fuck! Hrr hrrr akh! This shite again! Akh!
    485877|00000000||You mention a reward?
    504576|00000000||Mentioned a reward of some kind.
    504578|00000000||Hrr looted, hr hr hr raided, hrr drunk most away hrr… Bu-- All but one hrrr…
    504580|00000000||Hrr true trreasure, hrrr hid away. Yours, hrr hrr just…  hrr help me hrr hrr!
    507120|00000000||Looking for Craven.
    507125|00000000||Looking for a man named Craven. Apparently came here to kill you.
    507127|00000000||Hrr seems hrrr hrrr it didn't work out! Hrr…
    507129|00000000||Hrr those who come hrr hrrr rrarrely introduce themselves. Hrr hrr hrr what hrr did he look like? Hrrr…
    507131|00000000||Uhh, no idea.
    507133|00000000||Hrr then I cannot hrr help you! Hrr I've shredded hrrr hrr many! Hrr hrr…
    485876|00000000||Don't like being a werewolf?
    504519|00000000||So, no joy in being a werewolf?
    504521|00000000||Nay, hrr it's the worrrrrrst hrr… Not hrrr hrr the garrrrrden hrr to which I'm bound, hrr even… but the hungerrr hrr.
    504523|00000000||Hrr anything I devour hrrr turrrns to ash, hrr ash! I cannot eat, hrrr I cannot drink hrr, yet I bloody live and rrrrroam and prrrowlrrrr hrrrr…
   1075716|00000000||The hungerrrr is terrrrib-- argh terrrible! I bite my own flesh, hrrr but the smallest morrrrrsel burrrrns my thrrro-hrrr-throat. Hrr like hrr boiling tarrrrr hrrrr…
    504525|00000000||Everlasting hunger - classic as curses go.
    509908|00000000||Goes to explain why all those corpses went untouched.
    504532|00000000||Hrrr know hrrr… how to frrrree hrr me?
    504534|00000000||Cases like this, sometimes it's simple - feed the cursed one of your own will, not theirs. Other times it can be a real bitch.
    504601|00000000||Hrr help, or I'll hrr returrn to shrrred you, hrrr rrrip you limb frrrom limb!
   1004002|00000000||Wouldn't count on it.
   1004004|00000000||Fool! Hrr you can kill me once hrr, twice hrr, thrrrice hrr. But in the end I shall conquerrr hrr. Best lift the currrrrrse! Hrraaaugh!
   1003996|00000000||Wouldn't count on it.
   1003995|00000000||See what I can do.
   1003998|00000000||See what I can do.
   1004000|00000000||Hr see and do, hrr or I shall hrr return hrrr.
    504348|00000000||Here we are again.
    504350|00000000||You can hrrr hrrr hrrr end this. Hrrrre-- hrrrrrelease me!
    485880|00000000||Willing to talk now?
    504345|00000000||Only now can I. Ssssuch is the currrse. Hrrr makes me bite, hrr ssssscrrratch, mangle hrrr hrrr… till I drrrrop hrrrr…
    504346|00000000||You've got time… beforrre the blood's gone frrrrom me! An- and I rrrreturrrn. Listen, hrrr hrrr, carefully.
    504398|00000000||Hrr undo-- undo the currrse… Hrr frrrreee me, hrr finally… I will… I will… rrrrewarrrd hrr you hrrr…
    501551|00000000||[Hand him Toradar's fang.]
    504526|00000000||Tiresome conversation. Not interested.
    504630|00000000||What will you dooo?! Hrrr…
    504632|00000000||What a witcher ought to.
    485878|00000000||[Finish Morkvarg off.]
    504528|00000000||Farewell.
    504530|00000000||Hrr see you hrr soooon hrrr…
    485879|00000000||Farewell.
    498359|00000000||[Feed Morkvarg.]
    504623|00000000||Here, put this on.
    504833|00000000||I need hrrr hrrr no morrre fangs hrrr…
    504835|00000000||Don't be a smartass. Just do it.
   1010287|00000000||Mercy! Mercy!
   1010259|00000000||Ekhm. I don't want anything to do with you.
   1010261|00000000||Hey!
    388529|00000000||Said some beasts from the woods attacked her before she could reach the village…
   1054339|00000000||I'd give you a discount for heroic deeds, but the madame… well, you know.
    486014|5888d4cc||Drowned Dead
   1007198|00000000||What's he doing here?
   1007202|00000000||Piss off!
   1007204|00000000||Where d'you think you're going?
   1053217|00000000||Easiest way to tell a sorceress - they're perfect, unnatural beauties.
   1053219|00000000||Fair in the face, no pimples, no pockmarks. Eyes painted, narrow in the waist, and full breasts.
   1053221|00000000||Not seen any like that here. Believe me, I'd remember.
   1053223|00000000||But you will, eventually… And then remember this - their beauty's not born of nature but of witchcraft.
   1053225|00000000||Each is a hundred years old at least. They use spells to erase the years, straighten humps, remove warts and ulcers.
   1053227|00000000||What's wrong with that? I'd take some years off myself if I could.
   1053229|00000000||Shut it. Jests like that could land you in prison. Or on a pyre.
   1052608|00000000||You ever aim to show your customers some respect? The rubbish you offer, well, it's painful to look at.
   1052610|00000000||And… what is it you find lacking?
   1052612|00000000||Everything! These are old rags, not clothes. I'd be ashamed to show myself in public in these things.
   1052614|00000000||Then perhaps m'lady would care to lift the emperor's blockade? You could pick and choose all you like, then.
   1052616|00000000||Mind your manners.
   1052618|00000000||I've had enough of you lot! If you don't like what you see, go elsewhere!
    548357|00000000||Fine. Here's the key, now gimme some gold.
   1034425|00000000||Ah, see that, Grun? Kindness works atimes. Pleasure doin' business with ye, chum. Now piss off.
    548355|00000000||Fine, take the key.
    548356|00000000||I don't like being threatened.
    548359|00000000||Two things only the greatest fools do: throw stones at hornets' nests… and threaten a witcher.
    548361|00000000||Don't have any key.
    548362|00000000||Argh. Wanted to do the right thing by you. As a nonhuman to a witcher. But fine - a no is a no.
    548354|00000000||Don't have any key.
    548350|00000000||Hey, mate, someone invite you here?
    548351|00000000||No. Followed a trail. Of human blood.
    549125|00000000||So you found our pal Derrick? Well, well, must have a good eye. After our little, well, fallin' out, I spent half a day lookin' for 'im. And all I got outta it was a stroll and some dog shit on my shoes. Soiled me finest poulaines - snake skin, take a gander!
    548352|00000000||What're ye gabbin' for? Cleaver said it clear - anyone finds our den, chib 'im 'tween the ribs and drop 'im in the gutter.
   1034422|00000000||Think, Grun. Just once, use your fuckin' melon. If the witcher's found the body, he's found the key, too. Can't open the drop box without the key. We don't open the drop box, Cleaver don't get what he ordered. Cleaver don't get what he ordered, he gets angry. You want that? Didn't think so.
   1034424|00000000||So, er… hark your ear, mate. You got two options. First - give us the key. I pay you for your trouble, and everyone goes their own way smilin'. Second - make a fuss, and we do what Grun wants. Chib between your ribs.
   1030392|00000000||How will we ever make Whitford? Deserters and bandits on the highroads, fiends about the forests…
   1052546|00000000||There's the river. We could all three go in and hire a boat.
   1052548|00000000||No, not a chance. I sailed the Pontar once, that was enough.
   1052550|00000000||What happened?
   1052552|00000000||A kayran attacked our barge. It would've devoured us whole if not for the witcher on board.
    410341|00000000||Can we talk?
    422877|00000000||Lemme be.
    512079|00000000||Calm down. I just wanna…
    512081|00000000||Go, I said!
    424957|00000000||Farewell.
    512087|00000000||Shhh, kid.
    512092|00000000||Shush, now. Calm…
    512094|00000000||Caaa-aalm. Calm.
    512096|00000000||Nothing you could do for him, kid. Beast has to die, that's all… Leave it to me.
    512086|00000000||Nothing you could do.
    424959|00000000||I wanna avenge your father. But to do that, I gotta know what killed him.
    424961|00000000||Shrieker killed him! Don't you know?!
    424963|00000000||That name doesn't mean much to me. Describe the beast, tell me what it looked like.
    512083|00000000||Somethin' like a rooster… but huge… with a lizard's tail.
    512085|00000000||I-I-I heard Ruffler barkin' in the woods. Ran to see what he were on about. There were dad… in the bushes, a hole through his belly! And he were… moanin'! Screamin'! I wanted to help! But how could I?! How?!
    424955|00000000||I wanna avenge your father.
   1019020|00000000||Lemme alone.
   1076432|baa6fe89||Jester
   1037806|00000000||Haven't been to the Sturgeon yet.
   1037807|00000000||Fine, fine, Ravvy's not goin' anywhere. Let's clean out Caesar Bilzen first.
   1038493|00000000||So what's in this cabinet?
   1038495|00000000||Hah, no man knows. You'll be the first to see it.
   1038501|00000000||I suspect it's either to do with buggery or metallurgy. But you can tell me once we're done. Let's go.
   1038399|00000000||What else is in the cabinet?
   1038383|00000000||Wouldn't it be simpler just to buy the card from him?
   1038384|00000000||Can't we just buy the card off him? Doesn't that sound simpler?
   1038401|00000000||If I had a coin to spare, I'd sod off to Poviss. 'Sides, Caesar'd never sell Fringilla.
   1038416|00000000||But don't you worry - he won't lose out on the deal. Got a bottle of Mahakaman spirit for him. A taste of the motherland's finest is worth more to an expatriate than some silly card.
   1038450|00000000||Thought you said Caesar doesn't drink?
   1038453|00000000||Nooo, I said it's hard to have a drink with 'im on account of his rarely leaving home. Also why he's like to get pished as a priestess real quick.
   1038491|00000000||Three rounds and you could walk out with everythin' in that cabinet, while singin' the Three Maids of Vicovaro at the top of your lungs.
   1037810|00000000||We'll do this - I'll chat 'im up while you sneak upstairs and search his cabinet of curiosities. I'm certain he keeps the card there.
   1037808|00000000||Got the Natalis card.
   1037809|00000000||Excellent! Now we've just Caesar Bilzen to fleece, and we’ll be home free.
   1036955|00000000||Ah, you're here. How'd you make out with Ravvy?
   1068792|00000000||You're back.
   1068790|00000000||My sister mentioned a witcher'd come to town.
   1071654|00000000||Sister had it right.
   1071656|00000000||Do you want me? Hmm?
   1068796|00000000||I like you. Like to spend the night with you.
   1071658|00000000||You won't be disappointed.
   1068786|00000000||Like to spend the night with you.
   1068798|00000000||Take care, now.
   1068788|00000000||Take care.
   1068787|00000000||Why do you do this?
   1068800|00000000||Why do you work here?
   1071660|00000000||Why? There's nothin' wrong in it.
   1071662|00000000||Ever thought about where you might be fifteen years down the line?
   1071664|00000000||Runnin' my own brothel, I wager. Puttin' coin away towards it as we speak.
   1068794|00000000||What'll it be? Same as last time?
    566219|00000000||Here about the notice, the witcher contract?
    566220|00000000||Ah yes, I did post one.
    566203|00000000||Farewell.
    566234|00000000||This logger, where'll I find him?
    566235|00000000||Around. Last I saw him he was drinkin' away his pay. Said he had to honor his dead comrades.
   1067796|00000000||I'll take the job.
   1067792|00000000||I'll tend to it.
   1067800|00000000||I know I've not offered a fortune, but what you ask is simply too much. Come down a bit, so we can settle this.
   1067802|00000000||Mm, you're not cheap, but I can see you've tried to be reasonable. We might still agree a price.
   1067804|00000000||Very well… Let us say that's a price I'll pay willingly.
   1067806|00000000||You're daft, plain and simple! Ought to be a tax collector, not a witcher. You'll do the work at the goin' rate, or find yourself an idiot to work for.
   1067798|00000000||Let's talk about my pay. 'Cause the current offer's just not enough.
   1067793|00000000||Gotta pay my price.
   1067794|00000000||Farewell.
    566201|00000000||Farewell.
   1019080|00000000||I killed the leshen that attacked the lumberjacks.
   1019082|00000000||That's wonderful, grand even! I'll have to find some new loggers, but there's no shortage of folk lookin' for work.
   1038473|00000000||But… can I be certain no other leshen'll show?
   1038475|00000000||It's possible, I suppose. Have to find a witcher if it happens…
   1019084|00000000||Ah, yes, yes… Well, you're due a reward. I'm not the kind not to pay for a job well done.
   1074456|00000000||Job's done.
    566200|00000000||Saw your notice.
    566229|00000000||Saw the notice. Let's say I'm interested.
    567626|00000000||That's good. Grand, even. Name's Brean Hotsch. I posted that slip.
    567628|00000000||Gonna need details.
    566230|00000000||Course, 'course… Well, through a series of regrettable events, I came to own a spread of forest ripe for loggin'. Near Novigrad, at a distance from any roads, but quite near the port. Easy gold, right? Just hire some lumberjacks and count the coin.
    566231|00000000||Meant details about the monster, not your business.
    566232|00000000||It's all linked, see? I took on some dwarven loggers, but they came to me claimin' the forest's haunted. Thought them lazy, nothin' more. Then one day they went in the wood and only one returned.
    566233|00000000||Said some forest devil'd attacked them.
    566202|00000000||Welcome, master witcher.
   1039065|00000000||How are things, master witcher? Doin' anythin' about the dead loggers? Any bread gonna come of this yeast?
   1044582|00000000||Seven Cats is this way. Great… Girl just wants to have fun.
   1044580|00000000||Can't be far.
    339290|00000000||Good.
    339286|00000000||This way, I think…
    339288|00000000||Another clue.
    568023|00000000||I don't get it.
    589436|00000000||Changed mice into horses - third level transfiguration. I'm impressed.
    589438|00000000||But I still don't get it.
    568029|00000000||I'm a witcher, not a gigolo.
    568087|00000000||I'm a witcher, not a gigolo.
    568088|00000000||Don't flatter yourself. I don't want to shag you in the bushes, but to share a pleasant evening. But if no… Then no.
    590067|00000000||You're gonna have to conjure up your prince, too. Heard frogs are great for that.
    590069|00000000||You heard wrong. It's princes who get turned into frogs… It could happen to a witcher just as easily, so get out of my sight.
    590065|00000000||Bye, Keira.
    590064|00000000||Fine. I'll do it.
    590071|00000000||Ooh, all right. I'll do it.
    590073|00000000||I feel honored, truly.
    568072|00000000||No way.
    568083|00000000||No way. Don't like having spells cast on me… Besides, my clothes aren't rancid.
    568084|00000000||Debatable… But let's not argue and ruin the mood.
    568085|00000000||Well, off we go. Dinner's waiting…
    590096|00000000||Last one there does the dishes!
    568076|00000000||So, what do you think? Neckline too modest?
    590090|00000000||It's just right.
    590092|00000000||I might've also changed your hair color while I was at it… I've always fancied dark-haired men. Oh well. Any port in a storm.
    568073|00000000||Why not. Might as well go all out.
    568074|00000000||Then hold on tight.
    590061|00000000||Gvella, glan!
    568071|00000000||Why not.
    590077|00000000||Before we go… there's one more thing.
    590079|00000000||Gotta transform a pumpkin into a carriage?
    590081|00000000||No. I shall transform our rancid rags into something more glamorous.
    590083|00000000||Don't wince. It will only be an illusion, won't hurt a bit. And at dawn everything will return to normal.
    590075|00000000||Sounds tempting. So tempting I don't think I can refuse.
    568028|00000000||With pleasure.
    589448|00000000||Know the fairytale about Cinderella?
    589450|00000000||Mhm. True story it's based on, too. A zeugl cropped up in a palace pond and ate Princess Cendrilla whole. Left behind one slipper, so…
    589452|00000000||I beg you, not another word about zeugls.
    589454|00000000||Now, to return to the fairytale… I'd like to escape these ghastly swamps for one magical night. I don't need a fairy godmother, I'll cast the spells myself.
    589456|00000000||But I could use a prince charming… It just so happens you're the only decent candidate in all Velen. So, what do you say to a moonlight ride on horseback… and dinner?
    568024|00000000||Third mouse - what happened to it?
    568025|00000000||The spell has a sixty-six point six seven percent chance of success… I always use one more than I need. Just in case.
    589434|00000000||So where'd it-- Keira, gonna explain what's going on here?
    568022|00000000||What happened to the third mouse?
   1000967|00000000||Byc'hane, gvyn, caeffyl!
    568019|00000000||You've been patient - thank you. It's almost ready…
    589428|00000000||Huh? If I wanted to see white mice, I'd just get drunk.
    589430|00000000||Note that I said "almost." Now don't interrupt.
   1053065|00000000||The work in your fields gets done so quickly. How is that? Do you pay your hands triple wages?
   1053067|00000000||No, I just feed them well.
   1053069|00000000||Please. I've seen what your cooks give them. Overcooked porridge without a hint of gravy.
   1053071|00000000||The cooks add something else… a pinch of fisstech to every pot. A bowl of that and the peasants scurry about like ants.
    550570|00000000||Hey, white hair! Nice bum you have!
    550571|00000000||You were right! He doesn't blush!
   1052965|00000000||If the White Lady don't haunt but by day… maybe we oughta head out to the fields at night?
   1052967|00000000||To do what? Weed the beds in darkness? 'Sides, sure as shite some other filth prowls the night.
   1052969|00000000||We just supposed to watch the crops rot?
   1052971|00000000||Either that… or we find someone to drive the specter off.
    569354|00000000||This the place?
    569355|00000000||Greetings, witcher. It's nearby. Ready?
    569356|00000000||Lead the way.
    569357|00000000||Splendid. Come.
    569352|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
    569358|00000000||Need a minute.
    569359|00000000||Very well, but hurry, please.
    569353|00000000||Gimme a minute.
   1043134|00000000||I'm here.
   1043136|00000000||Excellent. Shall we?
    396507|00000000||You lose.
    396509|00000000||I just need to play one more time. I'll win it all back.
    396511|00000000||You've no coin left.
    396513|00000000||I'll wager my house!
    396515|00000000||All right.
    439440|00000000||Heard you can get fresh trout around here… cheap.
    439442|00000000||Whaa? Trout? Touch a trout - hiccup! - get chewed out! Hee, hee! Understand? It'd give you a rrright bollocking!
    439436|00000000||How much is trout these days?
    439444|00000000||So long.
    439438|00000000||Farewell.
    425891|00000000||Greetings.
    421230|00000000||Yeshhh?
    573297|00000000||I wanna see the king. It's about Philippa Eilhart.
    573298|00000000||If that's the case, come with me. But no sudden moves - got my eye on you.
    367715|00000000||Wanna see the king… about Philippa Eilhart.
   1011842|00000000||I wanna see Radovid.
   1011845|00000000||Ha, ha! Many want to. Not so many can.
   1011847|00000000||I'm to let no one on board unless expressly ordered to do otherwise.
   1011843|00000000||Wanna see the king.
    367717|00000000||Farewell.
    573295|00000000||Farewell.
    564136|00000000||This is the ship of His Majesty Radovid V, King of Redania. State your business.
    446326|064b5f22||Odrin
    502851|00000000||We've arrived.
    502853|00000000||Nice place.
    503581|00000000||I see you managed to find the place.
    502848|00000000||Not that hard. It's not exactly a small, concealed hovel.
    502406|00000000||I must say of all the creatures in this region, I find steeds most intriguing. Horses interest you at all, witcher?
    502408|00000000||All the same to me. Call each one I ride Roach.
    502410|00000000||Strange…
    502818|00000000||The gray is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from Vole.
    502820|00000000||Yeah... Gray's a good color. Even looks good on horses.
    502822|00000000||My coin's on the black stallion - Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian stock.
    502824|00000000||Surprised he didn't salute you, general.
   1068047|00000000||Not what I came here for.
   1068049|00000000||Don't make me beg, witcher. Tell you what - win, and I shall give you my finest saddle. Made in Nilfgaard proper of beautifully tanned leather.
    502418|00000000||Redanian chestnut's my choice. Thunderbolt, yeah.
    502527|00000000||Hmm... Redanian chestnut looks promising.
   1074250|00000000||I'll ride the Zerrikanian bay.
    502443|00000000||Think I'll give you a run on the Zerrikanian bay.
    502414|00000000||Like to give Nemrod a try.
    502437|00000000||I'll ride Nemrod. Pit a Nilfgaardian stallion against a Nilfgaardian general.
    503000|00000000||The horses are saddled. Let's begin.
    502441|00000000||Think I'll take the gray mare.
    502412|00000000||I'll take Cantarella.
    502708|00000000||Hah! Splendid. In that case, you must choose a mount.
    502836|00000000||Hm, why not. Wouldn't mind seeing if your knowledge of horses translates into riding skills.
    502827|00000000||Let's race.
    502828|00000000||Came here to talk to Molly.
    502834|00000000||I'd rather resolve things with Molly.
    502837|00000000||Well, there she is. See the slim young woman? Resolve what you must. I shall play the horses for a time. If you wish, we can ride back to the city together.
    503011|00000000||The Roach I chose put in a nice run.
    503012|00000000||Exceptional. I've not lost a race in a while. I congratulate you.
   1068052|00000000||That… is yours.
    503009|00000000||Acknowledge it, witcher. I'm the superior rider.
    503010|00000000||I'll acknowledge your Roach proved faster. Congratulations.
    502768|00000000||Ah, look! Lady l'Attard has just arrived.
    502770|00000000||Who?
    502772|00000000||The woman formerly known as Molly. There she stands.
    502774|00000000||Right... Thanks.
    502766|00000000||I shall be here for a time. Find me if you'd like to ride back to the city together.
   1055752|00000000||I had hoped to have a contest between gentlemen.
   1055824|00000000||Forgive me.
   1055754|00000000||Ah well, perhaps another time.
   1055826|00000000||Ah, at last, Molly appears. She's over there, by the horses.
    524100|00000000||Looking for someone to fight.
    524108|00000000||Looking for a fight.
    524110|00000000||Is that so? Got anything else to say?
    524112|00000000||Yeah. This is your lucky day.
    524102|00000000||Just takin' a walk.
    524104|00000000||With no destination? That's called loiterin'.
    524106|00000000||And loiterin's banned by decree of Hierarch Hemmelfart. Take him in.
    524099|00000000||Just walking.
    507358|00000000||Hey, you, witcher! Why are you here?
    521103|00000000||Wanted to ask you…
    521106|00000000||Aye, I play gwent. And aye, we can play for the prize card in me collection.
   1041960|00000000||You a mind reader?
   1041962|00000000||The good gods did… bless me with some precognition. I say some, 'cause it's selective like… only applies to mundane matters.
   1041964|00000000||Not a bird'll ever shit on me. But all my foresight's never helped me win at gwent.
    521539|00000000||Let's lay 'em out.
    521051|00000000||Let's play.
    521540|00000000||We'll play another time.
    521052|00000000||Can't play just now.
    521502|00000000||Another round?
    521503|00000000||Sure. Only diversion we get in this wasteland.
    521102|00000000||I wanna play gwent.
    521542|00000000||So is the soothsayer's lot. I'll know where to find the finest slippery jacks this fall, but how to play and not lose? That I'll never know.
    521545|00000000||A beautiful win. Take this card - you deserve it.
   1042191|00000000||Know of any others who play gwent?
   1076405|00000000||You've but one opponent worth your while in Velen. In the village of Midcopse. They calls him Haddy. He's a tyke, barely a handful of summers to him, but don't let that fool ye.
    521541|00000000||The good gods saw fit to let me win. Drop in for another round some time.
    521546|00000000||As we played, before my eyes shown a vision - an elven merchant near Oxenfurt. And from that same city, an innkeep named Stjepan. In my vision, ye played 'em both.
   1032331|00000000||We've nothing to discuss at the moment.
   1032329|00000000||Leave. Begone.
   1032327|00000000||I did not summon you.
    540904|00000000||No, thanks.
    540906|00000000||No, thanks. Don't need anything just now.
    540905|00000000||Yeah, let's… Hopefully no interruptions this time…
    540903|00000000||Let's do it.
   1011809|00000000||So, shall we trade?
    540902|00000000||And you're a fine fellow for not rattin' me out. Prepared to give you a discount for that, mate.
   1006927|00000000||Hey, witcher! Remember me?
   1006929|00000000||How could I forget? The magic goods dealer… and surprisingly fast runner.
   1006931|00000000||Haha! A hair slower, and they'd 'ave grabbed me.
    451659|00000000||That's a lotta bottles… We musta had quite the night…
    584228|576f0ae2||Courtesan
   1004395|00000000||What the hell, Lambert?
   1004405|00000000||You crazy? What the hell're you doing?
   1004407|00000000||I can explain everything.
   1003527|00000000||More guardsmen'll show soon.
   1035264|00000000||Let's go. Meet me at the Seven Cats. Tell you everything there.
   1035266|00000000||The tavern Vienne frequents?
   1035267|00000000||Yeah. See you later.
   1004397|00000000||That was murder. Was that really necessary?
   1004399|00000000||Yes.
   1004394|00000000||Gonna explain what this is about?
    581249|00000000||This guy's more trouble than the ekimmara.
    581250|00000000||Karadin's disappeared, I swear! The others too! I only know of Vienne…
    584576|00000000||What about Vienne?
    581251|00000000||She drinks at the Seven Cats. There day and night.
    584579|00000000||See? You can be helpful…
    455109|00000000||Oy, witcher! Coroner wants to see you, been another victim.
    455111|00000000||Told me to say the main door'll be open for you. You're to come soon as you can.
    358147|00000000||Deal.
    357992|00000000||All right.
    358149|00000000||Hmph. Not about to protect grave robbers.
    543668|00000000||Since when are witchers choosers? You're to protect folk, not put on airs.
    358151|00000000||Fine, if my coin's rank to ye, go kiss a dog 'neath its tail.
    357994|00000000||No chance.
    409281|00000000||What is it?
    409283|00000000||Got work for you. 'Cause you look to me eyes like a witcher. Am I right?
    409289|00000000||What do you need?
    409291|00000000||Need for me men to finish their work unharmed - but we got corpse eaters comin' out all the while. Rid us of 'em and we'll give ye a share.
    577185|00000000||Greetings, quartermaster.
    577186|00000000||Honor and glory, Geralt! How can I help?
    518279|00000000||Who are you? Why do you sniff around here?
    518280|00000000||Looking for work.
    518281|00000000||Wait, wait… Two swords, eyes like slits - you are a witcher, is that so?
    518386|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    518387|00000000||I have not heard the name, but you will find work here. This I know.
    499090|00000000||Show me what you're peddling.
    499065|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
    514733|00000000||Been a while since I played cards with a subject of His Imperial Majesty. Game of gwent? Let's lay 'em down.
    499068|00000000||Let's play cards.
    499069|00000000||So long.
    499067|00000000||See you.
   1058431|00000000||Been here long?
    508530|00000000||You look tired, quartermaster. Been stationed here long?
    508531|00000000||Too long. But the day will come when the emperor's banner will fly first over Novigrad, then over Tretogor. And we will all go home.
   1068165|00000000||Still wandering about the camp? Careful, they could name you a spy.
    567555|00000000||Hm, a mysterious mage-herbalist…
    567556|00000000||Must've burned these notes himself. The Hunt wouldn't have bothered…
    567557|00000000||Meaning he knew they were looking for him.
    567558|00000000||What's this?
    567559|00000000||The potion I gave him. Seems he saw a use for it, drank it.
    389413|00000000||Done.
    389419|00000000||The good gods've sent ye to me! Someone to repair their shrines from this day on!
    389421|00000000||Look, already got a trade - I'm a witcher. Restoring traditional roadside structures in wood - just not my specialty.
    389423|00000000||Fightin' evil - that's a witcher's callin'! And vandals're worse than beasts!
    389429|00000000||Fine, I see any damaged shrines I'll take care of 'em. Won't go out of my way, though.
    389431|00000000||Nothin's outta the way in these parts. And the gods'll guide ye!
    389425|00000000||I'll fix other shrines if I come across them.
    389427|00000000||Done enough already.
    389433|00000000||Helped you like you asked. Get someone else to see to the other shrines.
    576562|00000000||Convinced the imp to go back to the countryside to tangle horse manes and piss in milk - as tradition ordains.
    591869|00000000||And how would I know you speak the truth? No trophy, no reward.
    591871|00000000||There better be one. Or you'll feel the invisible hand of the market smack you so hard you won't be able to sit down for a week.
    591873|00000000||I'll give you half the agreed sum, no more. And I'll not do business with you again.
    576563|00000000||That imp of yours? Turned out to be a doppler. Kept shape-shifting… Until I took its head.
    591876|00000000||A doppler? Seems we've no means to rid ourselves of this scourge. We burn one, another appears. Accursed pests!
    576564|00000000||Perhaps now they'll give the market a wide berth at the least. I thank you, master witcher - in my own name and the guild's.
    576499|00000000||Problem solved.
    574889|00000000||Job's done.
    591880|00000000||Relax, I'll help you. Small businesses are the foundation of a healthy economy, and so on, and so on…
   1018613|00000000||Thank you, master witcher. I don't know if this will be of use, but most recently the thief leapt over that wall and ran into a passageway… It was the last I saw of him and a few of my wares.
    591854|00000000||I'll do it.
   1067918|00000000||That much?! Surely you jest, sir.
   1067920|00000000||A bit much… But a compromise is in sight.
   1067922|00000000||Fine negotiation on your part, master… So be it. We'll call it agreed!
   1067924|00000000||Time is coin, master witcher. And you waste it, squander it, sir! Take what I offer, or I shall find another to do the work!
    591882|00000000||Make it worth my while and I will. Demand for witchers is high, supply's low. I pick and choose my contracts these days.
    591855|00000000||Depends on what you're willing to pay.
    591856|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    591884|00000000||Lemme think about it. I'll let you know.
    574899|00000000||Farewell.
    574890|00000000||Take care.
    574888|00000000||I'm here about the contract.
    574900|00000000||Here about the contract… Really got an imp problem? Or is that just an imp-erfection in the notice?
    574901|00000000||You ought not jest, master witcher. I know the creatures are only to exist in fairy tales. Yet I saw one with my own eyes - as it stole from my stall!
    574932|00000000||What'd it swipe from you?
    574951|00000000||Once it was bread, then a fish, then apples… Might not seem like much, but add it together and the business suffers! And I'm hardly alone in being pestered. It's nicked something from every stand in the square!
    574923|00000000||What did the imp steal?
    574922|00000000||What's this imp look like?
    574930|00000000||All right. So what's this imp look like?
    574931|00000000||Like a mean, fat cat… But a very large one - this tall, see? And it walked upon its hind paws!
    574962|00000000||So? Will you teach it a lesson with your silver sword?
    591858|00000000||So? Will you slay the pest?
    576654|00000000||Greetings, master.
    549297|00000000||Master witcher… Help an ol' gran out…
   1009936|00000000||{*Whistles*}
   1009934|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1009931|00000000||Pff.
   1009925|00000000||Ptooey!
   1009929|00000000||That's racism!
   1009927|00000000||Run!
   1037820|00000000||Sorry. No time to chat. I've got to finish this.
    376684|00000000||Drowners… of course.
    472250|00000000||Think I know what happened. It was no woodland spook. Your horse is in a Scoia'tael camp.
    473419|00000000||Me mare's gone and joined the Squirrels? She were peaceful always, and now she's a rebel?!
   1016221|00000000||Argh…
    472256|00000000||How much'll you give me if I find your horse?
    472258|00000000||Give ye… a fifth o' vodka. Sound all right?
    472260|00000000||It'd sound fine if you changed that fifth to five, then added jugs at the end, then offered me the equivalent in crowns.
    472262|00000000||Well… fine. Have it your way. Just bring her back. She's a gray mare, mind ye. None too large.
   1023190|00000000||Even spooks leave tracks. Lemme look around, see if I can't find some.
    472235|00000000||How much'll I get for finding your horse?
    472266|00000000||Not the kinda job I do.
    472268|00000000||Why ain't it? You're a witcher, 'tis plain. And I won't go into the woods meself.
    473475|00000000||Why not? No woodland spooks in there, that's certain. Farewell.
    473477|00000000||What if I paid ye?
    473479|00000000||No.
    473481|00000000||Hm, hm. Strange, that 'un.
    472237|00000000||Just not my line of work.
    472248|00000000||A lot of horses disappear around here?
    472252|00000000||Horses disappear around here often?
    472254|00000000||Nay, sir. Not many horses at all these days. Soldiers took all that didn't die. But me neighbor had a steed, then two nights past - whoosh!
    473453|00000000||Spook took 'im. Times past, 'twere maybe a cow gettin' milked at night or a hen nipped here or there, but now-- Ahhhh…
    473710|00000000||Interesting.
    472239|00000000||What's the matter?
    472241|00000000||Woodland spook done took me mare the other night. And there I were, so content the war had spared her…
    478384|00000000||A woodland spook?
    473404|00000000||Aye. As me forefathers told it, comes at midnight, sprinkles blood on your threshold so as none'll wake - and then it steals.
    473422|00000000||Er… Would you search out me mare for me? Chat with the wood-dweller, perchance he'll give her back?
    594738|00000000||None of your business.
    594745|00000000||Doesn't matter. And don't change the subject.
    594747|00000000||Subject? What subject? You just arrived.
    594739|00000000||Someone who knows you're a traitor.
    594749|00000000||A new mate. Who knows you're a fink.
    594771|00000000||Who-ho! Let's be civil, now. Remember, you're on my turf.
    594757|00000000||Arnout Vester's men showed up at the manor. You were the only one knew I was there.
    594787|00000000||They'd been nippin' at your heels for a while - said so yourself. Perhaps they finally caught a whiff.
    594834|00000000||Mhm. With your help.
    594850|00000000||You've not been here five minutes and already you've offended me twice.
   1001631|00000000||No insult worthy of scum like you.
    594751|00000000||Sit down, care for a drink?
    594753|00000000||I don't drink with traitors and rats.
    594741|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
    594743|00000000||Another one? What's this - prime contract available in the area?
    594737|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    590845|00000000||Leeethooo, greetings! Good to see you alive and well.
    590847|00000000||Oh yeah?
    590848|00000000||Course! We're old mates, ain't we…? Who's your friend?
   1053648|00000000||The woman's mad. Unfortunate, really. I can't imagine where she gets the coin to feed that band of cats.
   1053650|00000000||Ooh, dearie, you'd be surprised!
   1053652|00000000||Our cat lover once led a band of ne'er-do-wells. They raided elven tombs.
   1053654|00000000||I'm certain she has heaps of treasure hidden about!
   1055168|300590eb||La Valette Guard Captain
   1006176|00000000||Sorry, Geralt. My throat's still quite…
   1006178|00000000||Say no more. Get well soon.
    357575|00000000||So, Irina's troupe managing all right?
   1006753|00000000||They continue to stage our play. Benedict Kumbrabone plays the witcher now, but all agree it's just not the same.
    357573|00000000||Irina Renarde and her troupe managing all right?
    490807|00000000||I'd expect him to lay low, not do any business for some time.
   1006719|00000000||Certainly hope you're right. Though his type never forgives and rarely relents.
    490809|00000000||He's dead.
    489648|00000000||Listen, I tracked down Whoreson Junior.
    489649|00000000||Yes? And? Did you learn somethin'?
   1006594|00000000||Yeah. Ciri and Dandelion set out to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure for Whoreson. He promised to find someone who'd fix Ciri's phylactery in exchange.
   1006595|00000000||I cannot believe she parleyed with the bastard! Why, it's widely known how anybody who pacts with Wily ends.
   1006600|00000000||Ciri was desperate. But you're right, wasn't the best idea. Whoreson ended up wounding Ciri, just after he'd tortured Dudu--
   1006664|00000000||Dudu? Well… Ho-- how is Dudu related to this in any way?
   1006665|00000000||Seems Dandelion got him involved, to help Ciri. Luckily, Dudu managed to escape. Probably hiding somewhere now.
   1006684|00000000||Ooh… What of Wily?
    489647|00000000||Tracked down Whoreson Junior.
   1086738|00000000||Don't have a choice. I gotta meet Whoreson Junior. He might know something.
   1073570|00000000||Dandelion - I know where he is.
   1073572|00000000||Where?!
   1073574|00000000||Dungeons on Temple Isle.
   1073576|00000000||That's not a nice jest.
   1073578|00000000||No jest, sadly. But don't worry, we'll pull him out. Triss has an idea. All we gotta do is find Dudu.
   1073580|00000000||So you must find Dudu in order to find Dandelion with the aim of ultimately finding Ciri? Sounds like an awful lot of searching, but I do wish you luck.
   1072855|00000000||Got some news about Dandelion.
    357598|00000000||Take care now.
    357596|00000000||See you.
    357571|00000000||Dandelion - how'd you meet?
    357589|00000000||Tell me - you and Dandelion… how'd you meet?
    357591|00000000||At a poetry tourney in Ellander. Naturally, I'd already heard much about Master Dandelion.
   1006503|00000000||And it proved true - at first I thought him a bloated, narcissistic buffoon.
   1006505|00000000||Just at first?
   1006507|00000000||Well, only cows don't change their minds. I changed mine when he came to congratulate me. Never expected he could lose so graciously.
   1006509|00000000||Dandelion can be irritatin', I shan't deny it. Yet, I also know he can be fair and noble at times.
   1006520|00000000||Well… I very much doubt I could bear to have him around were it not so.
   1006522|00000000||I see, I get it.
    357535|00000000||Geralt!
   1003854|00000000||He raise tribute for them? He does. Plays host to 'em? Aye.
   1003856|00000000||Then why the hell we puttin' up barriers?
   1003858|00000000||Baron's chummy with the Black Ones…
   1003860|00000000||…but the wounds're still fresh. Everyone remembers what the Empire can do.
   1044796|00000000||Grab her!
   1044798|00000000||Not our concern, mate.
   1044800|00000000||Whoreson Junior says it is! You're to hunt the cunt down and kill her, got it?!
   1086497|00000000||Gwent - would you play me?
    522348|00000000||Oy, witcher! A moment, please!
    573661|00000000||Geralt of Rivia?
    522365|00000000||You're comin' with us.
    573671|00000000||To what do I owe this invitation?
    573673|00000000||Got some new torture tools we'd like to show you.
    573665|00000000||To what do I owe this invitation?
    573664|00000000||Where to? Your barracks at the docks burned down.
    573667|00000000||Where to? Heard your barracks at the docks burned down. My condolences, by the way.
    573669|00000000||Condolences? They'll be in order once were done with you.
    573675|00000000||Get 'im!
    438240|00000000||I did not know she dealt in magic!
    438242|00000000||Ignorance don't wipe away your guilt.
    438244|00000000||Then what… what does?
    438246|00000000||Fire. Only fire.
    438250|00000000||I… I can pay. In the bank, I've…
    450164|00000000||Oh, you'll pay. Soon. Now be silent.
    594319|00000000||Fine, fine - enough! Great Freya's tits, that sobered me up quick…
    594320|00000000||Gents, let's go, now! Have our fun elsewhere…
    413350|00000000||Never visit the witch meself.
   1002358|00000000||I've my health, thank the gods, and for the rest? Well, she can't bake bread from stone either.
    413352|00000000||Come on, this new one's not half bad.
    476614|00000000||Sharp tongue on her, but she helps when there's a need.
    413628|00000000||She can't fill our guts with spells.
    413634|00000000||Besides, got no warts and she's not cross-eyed.
   1002367|00000000||And what's a witch with no gray on her head? Not much likely to be inside it…
    476635|00000000||For one who never sees her, you seem to know a heap about her.
    476637|00000000||I know what they say. Don't care much meself, but when folk talk, I listen.
    356998|00000000||Tell me. It's important.
    357059|00000000||I want-- I need to find her, understand? I need every last bit of information available.
    477031|00000000||I understand. But you see, it so happens my wife and daughter are missing as well.
    383889|00000000||Deal.
    383915|00000000||Fine. I'll help you. I'll find your family, but then you'll give me every bit of information you have.
    383919|00000000||You have my word.
    384019|00000000||Guard! This man's under my protection. No one's to bother him - in any way.
    384030|00000000||Don't stare - I've not grown horns. Treat it as a token of my good faith.
    383943|00000000||Got any enemies?
    179792|00000000||Maybe they were kidnapped. Got any enemies?
    179794|00000000||None worth mentioning. Worthless little pricks and angry peasants is all. None would dare raise a finger against my family.
    179796|00000000||Any who might've, they've been eating dirt long since.
    383945|00000000||Notice anything unusual recently?
    178883|00000000||Anything unusual happen before they disappeared? They act differently, do anything strange?
    178885|00000000||Unusual? No… But not long ago, peasants came to complain that a beast had ravaged a woman by the well. Devoured another lass before her. Common occurrences in Velen.
    397269|00000000||And my women? Anna, quiet as a mouse, as ever. And Tamara, occupied with her… things… Nothing unusual.
    383966|00000000||Your men ever bother them?
    357265|00000000||This place - must be hard to be the only two women here.
    397967|00000000||"This place"? What do you mean? They wanted for nothing here! Pheasant for dinner? Not a problem. Blue ribbons from Toussaint? Say the word.
    397969|00000000||Had your men in mind, their company. Sure your wife and daughter weren't being harrassed?
    383972|00000000||My men are a horde of whoresons, but they know their place. One of them so much as looked at Anna or Tamara crosswise, I'd cut him down like a dog.
    179804|00000000||Have you searched?
    178879|00000000||You try to search for them?
    178881|00000000||Sent men out right away. But they're not suited to it. It's one thing to rip up floorboards in search of a peasant's last sack of grain. Finding a living person - they just don't know how.
    397265|00000000||Besides… Velen's naught but swamps and marshy woodland. Plenty of hard to find nooks. If you're lookin' to hide someone, this is the place.
    383949|00000000||I need more information.
    383982|00000000||I'll need to know a lot more than that. Can I see their rooms?
    471770|00000000||What for?
    471772|00000000||I need clues, anything to latch onto.
    383984|00000000||I'll not let a stranger paw through their belongings.
    471774|00000000||Want me to find them or not?
    471776|00000000||I do.
    471778|00000000||Then let me work.
    411202|00000000||Huh, fine. But I shall go with you. The doors are locked.
    357111|00000000||I need more information.
    359646|00000000||What do they look like?
    359648|00000000||Can't start searching till I know what they look like.
    359652|00000000||Tamara, my daughter, turned nineteen in the spring. Slender lass, about yea tall, comes up to my shoulders.
    411196|00000000||Beautiful eyes. Green like her mother's.
    384992|00000000||My wife, Anna, has two score winters behind her, though she'd never admit it.
    411198|00000000||Dark hair, thick as tar. Keeps it tied up in a bun.
    384974|00000000||When'd you see them last?
    384976|00000000||They vanished after the new moon, as if whisked away by shadows.
   1057959|00000000||What do you mean, "vanished"?
   1057961|00000000||Precisely that. I awoke one morn to find them gone.
    383893|00000000||Huh, what if I refuse, 'cause I just don't want to?
    383895|00000000||Would you tell me to sod off? Go ahead. But then I'll tell you the same. And what'll that make us? Two helpless, empty-handed sods.
    411167|00000000||Think of it as searching for your own daughter. Ought to go quickly, then.
    383887|00000000||What if I refuse?
    471742|00000000||How do I know I can trust you?
    471744|00000000||Thing is, can I trust you? What guarantees do I have?
    471746|00000000||Hahah! None whatsoever. Only my word.
    179744|00000000||I propose an exchange - find my loved ones, and I shall tell you about the girl you seek. All I know.
    357022|00000000||Take it you won't give me this information for free.
    477027|00000000||Heheh, sharp you are.
    477029|00000000||I regret your loss, commiserate. But you see, it so happens my wife and daughter are missing as well.
    356994|00000000||I get what you're after.
    496047|00000000||The little girl who showed up here with Ciri - what happened to her?
    496048|00000000||Gretka? She's safe and sound. Helps out in the kitchen.
    496597|00000000||Ciri told me of the girl's parents, what they'd decided. So I decided not to send the lass home.
    496599|00000000||She's fed here. A roof over a warm corner she calls her own. She wants for nothing.
   1049372|00000000||What happened to Ciri?
   1049374|00000000||I've told you already - a topic for another time.
    496046|00000000||Gretka - where is she now?
    356996|00000000||Talk.
    357055|00000000||No. A topic for now. Talk.
    357057|00000000||That sharpness - watch your tone, witcher.
    477019|00000000||Remember, you owe me. Butchered some of my better men.
    477731|00000000||We wish to come to an agreement, do we not?
    383937|00000000||So I ordered my men to watch her and left her to rest.
    356020|00000000||And?
    356027|00000000||Ahhh, a topic for another time.
    452271|00000000||The sewers always this exciting?
    455678|00000000||Mhm. Luckily.
    455680|00000000||Luckily?
    455682|00000000||Steady source of income. C'mon, let's go.
    450693|00000000||It's a katakan!
    455650|00000000||A what?!
    455652|00000000||A vampire! Watch out for its venom!
   1059630|00000000||Be so kind as to follow me.
   1052310|00000000||Johann, you just don't look well.
   1052312|00000000||I feel even worse. Had the runs all night, feel like me guts are turned topsy-turvy.
   1052314|00000000||Must've ate some rancid shite.
   1052316|00000000||What choice have I got? I eat what there is to eat! With this ploughin' war, vittles're nastier and nastier, and even they'll end soon.
   1004431|00000000||So? You in?
   1004432|00000000||Me wife would tear me head off if she learned of it.
   1004433|00000000||Prick gone soft or somethin'? Bring home food, wench won't say a thing.
   1004330|00000000||When'll you return, my son?
   1004331|00000000||Best not wait for me, mum. Be back when we're done.
   1004332|00000000||Argh, couldn't you take to harvestin' beehives, like your father did…?
   1004333|00000000||What for? To die from hunger like dad did? No, mum. I'll handle it my way.
   1008209|00000000||How are things, neighbor?
   1008207|00000000||Greetings.
   1008205|00000000||Hm?
   1008203|00000000||You in a hurry?
   1008201|00000000||Where's my axe?
   1018038|00000000||I'm here to play, not chatter.
   1028343|00000000||Triangular hole in the wall… Interesting.
    461039|00000000||Come back, you coward!
   1021913|00000000||Begone, vile bandit! Or the Crimson Avenger will beat you senseless!
    317519|00000000||The Crimson Avenger triumphs again!
    319559|00000000||My hero! Are you well?!
    319561|00000000||One blow struck true… Another scar for my collection.
   1022339|00000000||Come inside, I shall bandage you up.
   1044715|00000000||Hahahah! Turned yellow, have you?! Fine, away with you! And never come back!
    594864|00000000||How much they pay you to double-cross him?
    594929|00000000||I'm curious - how much does the life of an "old mate" get you these days?
    594931|00000000||Things… Things been shite of late… And we fell afoul o' the Black Ones…
    594933|00000000||Vester showed up one day. Offered half of the bounty on your head and a letter of absolution from the emperor.
    594935|00000000||You gotta understand - you don't say no to an offer like that.
    595026|00000000||I understand.
    595029|00000000||Hey! My medicine!
    595088|00000000||Gotta understand, Louis. You don't betray men like me.
   1001633|00000000||Time to see Vester.
   1075828|00000000||Going with you.
    594885|00000000||Don't believe you, somehow.
    594927|00000000||Why would I lie?
    595001|00000000||Letho, you gotta forgive me. It weren't nothin' personal.
    594863|00000000||You're a traitor. Makes you a liar, too.
    594855|00000000||Lie still or you'll bleed to death.
    594857|00000000||Tell me where Vester's men are. I'll give you something to stanch the bleeding.
    594859|00000000||Th-they're north of here. In Lindenvale.
   1041880|00000000||Triss'. Never knew her to drop 'em on the floor…
    580336|00000000||Dijkstra, I don't know how to--
    580338|00000000||No time for courtesies, my dear. Get on board.
    448828|00000000||One last farewell.
    451430|00000000||Thank you. I'll never forget what you did for me… And what we had together.
    460207|00000000||Let's try again.
    460209|00000000||Let's try again.
    460211|00000000||I don't have the strength to try. If I was sure it would work…
    451460|00000000||Go. I'll miss you.
    451472|00000000||I'll miss you. Terribly.
    451476|00000000||I know how you feel.
    460215|00000000||Miss Merigold! We're castin' off!
    451462|00000000||I… I love you.
    451458|00000000||I love you.
    448874|00000000||Stay with me.
    448876|00000000||Geralt… not this again. Especially not here, not now.
    451433|00000000||Miss Merigold! We gotta sail!
    451437|00000000||Please.
    451439|00000000||We had our chance, but… let it go.
    448832|00000000||Stay with me.
    448830|00000000||Farewell, Triss.
    448870|00000000||I'll remember you, too. Always with a smile.
    451567|00000000||Miss Merigold!
    451569|00000000||Coming!
    451571|00000000||Take care… and give Ciri a kiss from me once you find her.
   1054327|00000000||Next bloke to tell me a witcher's heart's cold to the woes of the common man…
   1054329|00000000||…gets my fist down his lyin' gullet!
   1043701|00000000||Shhh, quiet, all of yous! Butcher'll think the hut's abandoned, move on.
    437901|00000000||How much longer will this last?
    437903|00000000||Till we inspect all the cargo.
    450108|00000000||All?! I've got ten tons of sheepskins alone! Do you know how long that will take?
    450110|00000000||No. And I don't give a fuck.
    437905|00000000||Cap'n… It's no use. Let it go.
    450112|00000000||Last time I make port here, you'll see! I'd rather trade with those savages in Skellige!
    437890|00000000||You've taken a third of my cargo! Who ever heard of such a tax!
    437892|00000000||Tain't no tax, it's confiscation. Those goods might've found use in witchcraft.
    437894|00000000||What?! My trade's in fragrances!
    437896|00000000||Exactly. Make a fine base for potions.
    450104|00000000||This is absurd! I shall complain to your commander!
    450106|00000000||Oh, prime idea. He'll greet you with open arms… Maybe even put you up in the dungeon for the night.
   1056133|0b95e2d9||Sick Man
   1006246|00000000||Sweet Nettie. Where is she?
   1006248|00000000||Upstairs. But she's with a very important client - do not disturb them!
    592595|00000000||Don't have time to go back and forth on this. Let's do this quick: man to man.
   1016111|00000000||Do what, dammit? Whatcha wanna do man to man with me? Invitin' me into the alcove?
   1016113|00000000||No, pea brain. Challenging you to a duel. I win, you take your mates and get outta here.
   1016115|00000000||Ahh, why didn't you say so?! I'm always up for smackin' a man about the gills.
   1002119|00000000||Let's you and me settle this man to man.
   1002133|00000000||I'm not going anywhere, but you are. If not, I'll carry you out… right after I knock you unconscious.
   1002136|00000000||Ye threatenin' me? Me?! Know who I am?! Yormund of Faroe!
   1016120|00000000||Never heard of you.
   1016118|00000000||Bleedin' Continental rats… Oy, mates, c'mere! This pipsqueak's lookin' to get his gob walloped!
   1002132|00000000||Get out of here or taste my wrath.
   1002122|00000000||Be good boys and leave.
   1002134|00000000||Collect your friends and go. On your best behavior, now.
   1002137|00000000||Uhhh…. Aye. Gents, time to go!
    594525|00000000||That wrath of yours didn't do squat against the Ice Giant. My sword was more effective.
    594526|00000000||Wait… you're… Geralt of Rivia? The one went to Undvik with young an Craite?
    594527|00000000||In the flesh.
    594528|00000000||Ah, that's another kettle o' fish… When a friend asks, a Skelliger never refuses.
   1016128|00000000||Gents, our time's come! Geralt the Giant Slayer's got need of this inn!
   1002121|00000000||Killed the Ice Giant. Can probably handle you, too.
   1016100|00000000||I'm gone.
   1002135|00000000||Well, don't let me disturb you, then. Enjoy yourselves.
   1002138|00000000||Ah, thank ye, thank ye! Lookie that, decent men to be found even in this arsedump of a city!
   1002125|00000000||Not about to get involved. So long.
   1016102|00000000||Seems to me we're still in Novigrad. And in Novigrad, Novigrad rules apply. Rules you happen to be breaking.
   1016104|00000000||Just how's that? Ye not allowed to drink in peace? Have a bit o' fun? Leg it, man, afore you taste the wrath of a Skelliger.
   1016099|00000000||Get out of here.
   1002453|00000000||Sorry, mate, gotta fill your horn elsewhere. This establishment's part o' Skellige today!
    569456|00000000||They were right! The place is haunted!
    569457|00000000||Cowards! Illusions left by mages, that's all!
    572509|00000000||Captain! Permission to conduct an inspection.
    569458|00000000||Inspect your arsehole! I'll not go in there without reinforcements!
    572512|00000000||Move out!
   1045437|00000000||House is haunted, I tell you.
    459397|00000000||No need to fear me.
    459401|00000000||Don't be afraid.
    588177|00000000||What happened next?
    588181|00000000||What happened then?
    588182|00000000||Fear, terrible fear. I feared the men who approached, but I also feared the potion, drinking it.
    438226|00000000||Will you help me now? You promised not to leave me here…
    438128|00000000||Fine, I'll talk to Graham. Where will I find him?
    438130|00000000||He lives in the village on the lakeshore. Yet… what if he's forgotten me?
    335314|00000000||If he loved you, he'll remember. And wanna help.
    447397|00000000||He said he would always love me… Go to him. Make haste, please.
    439294|00000000||Fine.
    459346|00000000||I won't help you.
    459352|00000000||I can't help you. Taking anything off this cursed island, from any cursed place - just too dangerous. And a dead woman's bones? That's asking for trouble.
    459354|00000000||They said witchers are heartless beasts.
    459356|00000000||Will you bring Graham here, then? I so long to say goodbye.
    459360|00000000||Anabelle, listen--
    459358|00000000||You never wished to help me! And here I hoped someone would finally take pity on me. Stupid woman that I am!
    459348|00000000||I think you're lying. Question is: why? To protect the beast, or is it that--
    459350|00000000||Stop! I will not hear this!
    459344|00000000||Got a feeling you might be lying.
    427693|00000000||Really sad story, but something's not right. Got a feeling…
    427695|00000000||What is it?
    446323|00000000||You're not telling me everything. You know the island's dangerous, but refuse to tell me about the monster that lives here.
    446325|00000000||There is no monster!
    446321|00000000||Not sure I trust you.
    438134|00000000||Really hope I can help. Need to look around first.
    438136|00000000||Whatever for? Naught in the tower but bones and rats. Don't leave me with them again!
    447227|00000000||I'll come back for you. You can be sure.
    447243|00000000||Very well. But... come back soon. Don't keep me waiting.
    439296|00000000||Need to look around.
    453258|00000000||As I see it, you're the curse's focus. The other ghosts on the island - their auras aren't nearly as strong as yours.
    453271|00000000||My medallion started pulsating as soon as we started talking.
    453260|00000000||I don't know what you mean, but you do seem to know some things.
    453304|00000000||You could be right. My fate is tied to the isle - I feel that. Perhaps because I'm heiress of these lands?
    453262|00000000||It could be your blood ties to the land, the base of the curse, that is. If so, forgiving Graham, laying your resentment to rest, should lift it.
    453264|00000000||I… loved him. I'm prepared to forgive him. But I must know that he regrets what he did.
    453308|00000000||Take my bones to him. He must bury them. This will be our farewell. Will you speak to him? Will you do this for me?
    453316|00000000||The curse is focused on you.
    453318|00000000||Graham - tell me about him.
    453189|00000000||Your beloved - who is he? A noble's son?
    453255|00000000||No, a poor fisherman. My father objected. Strongly. He did not see us together.
    459416|00000000||Oh, I miss him so… Each night I walk to the island's shore to gaze upon the village. Does he remember me still?
    459421|00000000||Hm, said before you can't leave the tower.
    459423|00000000||Did I? You must have misheard.
    459425|00000000||I don't think so.
    459427|00000000||I… I don't know anymore. It's all a nightmare to me…
    447303|00000000||How can I help you?
    447305|00000000||A curse born of hatred binds me to this place. Only love's power can hope to lift it, but… who could love a wraith?
    447446|00000000||And your beloved - he dead, too?
    447448|00000000||Graham… No, he lives. I would know if he died. But he fled and abandoned me! Left me here all alone!
    447470|00000000||Maybe you could strip the curse of its power by forgiving him. You might cleanse the isle.
    335271|00000000||How can I help you?
    459566|00000000||Can you talk to the island's other specters?
    459568|00000000||No, I'm alone here. The others, they flee when they see me. I know not why.
    459593|00000000||You do not fear me, do you?
    459595|00000000||No. Used to dealing with ghosts. Though… gotta admit, there's something about you. You're… different.
    459506|00000000||Can you talk to other souls?
    427670|00000000||Found a fresh corpse in the tower.
    427672|00000000||You weren't the last to die on this island. Found a fresh corpse in the tower.
    446311|00000000||The island's a dangerous place. Folk should not venture here - I too wish to leave.
    446313|00000000||The dead man - looked like a monster had attacked him. Recently. The tower home to anything else?
    446315|00000000||How am I to know? There's lots of wraiths here. I hear them whispering every night.
    446317|00000000||Not talking about ghosts. A monster who hunts here. You must've noticed something…
    446319|00000000||I don't know! I've noticed naught - why do you ask?! Why must you press me so?! You're to be my savior, not my tormentor!
    447188|00000000||Did they hurt you?
    447190|00000000||They gripped my arms, tore at my dress… I managed to free myself and drink the potion, and then… nothing.
    447192|00000000||Poisoned? That how you died?
    447200|00000000||No, for I later awoke. I was alone, it was dark. Only there were rats… everywhere. Dozens. Hundreds. And I… couldn't move.
    447202|00000000||Sleeping potion. Effects hadn't worn off yet. You were paralyzed…
    447204|00000000||They were everywhere, all over me, like insects. My face, my hands… I felt them rip open my skin, then crawl into my stomach…
    450880|00000000||They tore me apart, and I could not even scream…
    447213|00000000||Have I not suffered enough? Why can't I leave this place?!
    447174|00000000||Did they harm you?
    447176|00000000||Your beloved failed to save you. Why?
    447180|00000000||Your beloved failed to save you? Why?
    447182|00000000||There were too many… "Leave her be!" he shouted. He grabbed at them, tried to stop them. They just laughed…
    588183|00000000||Didn't trust the mage?
    588184|00000000||In the village they claimed he meddled in disease. Not curing it, but causing it. They said he lured rats into the tower, infected them with the Catriona.
    588185|00000000||Only rumors, surely. But I was afraid, so horribly afraid…
    447156|00000000||And then I heard him, my beloved Graham. He called to me… I opened the door for him, but others rushed in. They lunged at me and… and…
    588179|00000000||What kind of potion was it? Remember its smell, what it looked like?
    588180|00000000||I remember only that I feared to drink it.
    588176|00000000||The potion - what was it?
    447142|00000000||Tell me what happened here. Peasants sailed to the island to ask for food. Is that true?
    447144|00000000||No, they came to rob and kill! They thought us rich, believed we'd stowed ourselves away here to laugh at their misery.
    450860|00000000||Yet we had little food as well. Too little to share with those who came.
    447146|00000000||They slaughtered everyone… I heard my father cry out, but the mage told me not to reveal myself or to let anyone in.
    588175|00000000||He gave me a potion. If I was discovered, I was to drink it… He said everything would be all right.
    447089|00000000||What happened in the tower?
    447091|00000000||The mage of the tower - who was he?
    447099|00000000||Mage who lived here - who was he?
    447123|00000000||Alexander. I hardly knew him. He spent most of his time locked away in this tower. He's dead, too, you know!
    447128|00000000||They're all dead! Mountains of corpses! Yet I stand here alone! All alone! They've all abandoned me, even he who promised me everlasting love. You will abandon me as well!
    447477|00000000||If I can lift the curse, you yourself'll be free to leave.
    459403|00000000||I wanna lift the curse that grips this island. Your turn to tell me who you are. The other ghosts… they couldn't see me.
    459407|00000000||I'm special. Always was. The rare beauty. The lord's daughter. These lands, as far as the eye can see, were ours.
    459409|00000000||My family and I, we hid in the mage's tower, to await the war's end, the end of hard times. It was not to be forever!
    459399|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    459395|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    446335|00000000||Why did you leave? You claimed to love me.
    453161|00000000||I'm cold… Why has no one come for me? I cannot leave this place, I see no way out…
    446339|00000000||Who are you? Do you seek to hurt me as well?
   1033063|00000000||Good folk, there's fighting on the bridge!
   1033062|00000000||What's the commotion?
   1033064|00000000||Who is it?
   1033065|00000000||Please, don't hurt us.
   1033066|00000000||Out of my house! This is no place to brawl!
    504708|00000000||Who will fight the terrible Archibald O'Neill?
    504759|00000000||Hey! Perhaps you would stand against our champion?
   1034923|00000000||Had my doubts.
   1034933|00000000||Had a moment of doubt when the bolt pierced Fergus' armor. Didn't last long, though.
   1034926|00000000||Thank you for trusting me. Give us a few days, and your armor'll be ready.
   1034931|00000000||Come on, let me help you get out of that.
   1034925|00000000||Master craftsmanship's something I trust in, something I strive for myself. Wouldn't have asked for legendary tools from Undvik and archgriffin acid if you didn't know what you were doing.
   1034922|00000000||Believed you all the way.
   1038434|00000000||Stand. I wish to see the armor.
   1031761|00000000||Not even a dent.
   1031760|00000000||I am not easily impressed, but I must admit you have succeeded, my dear.
   1031763|00000000||Where to, dwarf? You must hear this. The forge is now Miss Yoana's. She will also assume all Nilfgaardian army requisitions. Is that clear?
   1034893|00000000||Aye, as day.
   1034896|00000000||Your pay for the armor. I will send a man to collect it.
   1031764|00000000||I'll be goin', too, methinks… Just get my things.
   1034899|00000000||Wait. We needn't part ways, Fergus. You've been a good helper - we could go on that way. But… without the lie…
   1031766|00000000||Hmm… We did make quite the pair.
   1034919|00000000||Well then, go stoke the fire. We've got a customer, he needs armor fit for a witcher.
   1031767|00000000||You weren't certain the armor would protect you. Admit it.
   1031734|00000000||Gonna live?
   1031735|00000000||Ah… Aye. But this armor's rubbish.
    508436|00000000||Must be Zed…
   1018235|00000000||Are you well and whole? I feared--
   1018631|00000000||Unnecessarily. Let's look around.
   1073127|00000000||If I've my knickers on straight, this looks like the elf's laboratory.
    507755|00000000||Blood looks fresh, but where're the bodies? Hm…
    507756|00000000||Takes strength to do something like this.
    507757|00000000||Insect excretions…
    507758|00000000||Monster tracks.
    525776|00000000||Blood, flesh, digestive juices… Food for its young.
    525782|00000000||Eggs'll hatch soon. Gotta destroy them.
    526608|00000000||Something just woke up.
    526703|00000000||Young specimen. Mother can't be far.
   1049952|00000000||Arachas… a venomous one.
   1052124|00000000||Putting yourself to the sword? All the better.
   1052127|00000000||Need a trophy for Mikkel's brother. Proof of what happened.
    507754|00000000||Ugh… Smells worse than it looks.
   1052118|00000000||Calfskin ankle boot… All that's left of Mikkel.
    525813|00000000||A shoe… bearing Master Clogs' mark. All that's left of the body.
   1009900|00000000||Whatever.
   1009896|00000000||Hmm...
   1009898|00000000||At your service.
   1009894|00000000||Yaaaaaaawn…
   1009890|00000000||No! Please!
    173721|00000000||Both were here. I'm going the right way.
    481203|00000000||Hey! Sod off! We're lootin' here.
    479973|00000000||Want you gone by the time I count to three. One…
    481194|00000000||Hear that?
    481196|00000000||Two…
    481198|00000000||Ooh, lookie. Thinks he can scare us off.
    481200|00000000||Three…
    479971|00000000||Get lost.
    479972|00000000||Let's talk.
    479974|00000000||Not here for the loot. Interested in the sorceress who lived here.
    479975|00000000||We're supposed to believe that?
    481250|00000000||Yeah.
    480058|00000000||Calm, now… W-we'll split it. Plenty for everyone.
    480059|00000000||I'm not a thief. Looking for the sorceress who lived here.
    480060|00000000||Ah! Nah… don't! No more, please!
    480061|00000000||Where's the sorceress who lived here?
    481355|00000000||Most likely hidin' in some rattrap with the rest of 'em.
    481357|00000000||Why's she in hiding?
    481374|00000000||Who's she hiding from?
    481376|00000000||Temple Guard's crackin' down. All mages're fair game.
    481380|00000000||They round 'em up like rats.
    481356|00000000||Who might know?
    481370|00000000||Someone's gotta know more.
    481372|00000000||I'd look for 'er in the Putrid Grove.
    481419|00000000||Lovely name.
    481430|00000000||Putrid Grove… Interesting as names go.
    481432|00000000||A hive of scum and freakery, if there ever was one. No decent folk show their hides there.
    501193|00000000||That why you think I should look for my friend there?
    501195|00000000||I meant no offense.
    481418|00000000||Where's the Putrid Grove?
    481421|00000000||Putrid Grove - where is it?
    481423|00000000||I wouldn't know. Rumor has it it's a place for freaks and oddities.
   1046755|00000000||You'd fit in well there.
   1064477|00000000||Maybe. Thing is, gotta know how to get there.
   1061422|00000000||They say you gotta get there through the sewers, but you gotta enter them outside of town. Few know where exactly, though.
    497313|00000000||Ask a beggar. Or spot yourself a thief, follow him… Beggars and thieves gotta pay tribute to the King of Beggars. Word is they do it in the Grove.
   1046740|00000000||Mean to say the local beggars have a king? Crown, scepter and all that?
   1046742|00000000||Wouldn't scoff, mate. King of Beggars, it's a moniker, yeah, for a man who everyone in Novigrad respects deeply.
    497364|00000000||And watch yourself. Menge himself don't even go to the Grove.
    497467|00000000||It's about their hearing, not sense of smell.
    497474|00000000||Got nothing to do with their sense of smell. It's about their hearing.
    497476|00000000||Well, well… Man knows his bats. Here I thought you only cared about monsters.
    497468|00000000||What do you want?
    497478|00000000||What's your point?
    497480|00000000||I ask the questions… witcher.
    497513|00000000||Who's it for, then?
    497522|00000000||Heard Novigrad was no place for mages. Now you're telling me it's no place for witchers. So who's it a place for?
    497524|00000000||Righteous folk professing the one true faith in the Eternal Fire.
    497544|00000000||Nothing I can do to you now, but just know that I know you're here. One misstep, one error… You'll make a mistake, it's inevitable…
    497546|00000000||I'll be the first to learn of it. And when I do, it'll be standard procedure. Like for every magic oddity who dares taint this city's air.
    497549|00000000||Be seeing you.
    497515|00000000||I haven't done anything wrong.
    497517|00000000||But you will. Sooner or later your sort always causes trouble. And this city's mine to protect.
    497832|00000000||Mine, and the Eternal Fire's.
    497512|00000000||Got nothing on me.
    497511|00000000||And as bats sense moths, so I sense freaks. And start by warning them - Novigrad's no place for your kind.
    497470|00000000||Small animals - can't say I'm really interested.
    497472|00000000||I know your trade. Spotted those yellow eyes amidst the rabble in the square right away.
    497830|00000000||Did you notice how much common folk love flames? The Eternal Fire will consume them all one day, one way or another.
    497466|00000000||Don't know much about small animals.
    497297|00000000||Someone call for me? Wonder why.
   1044346|00000000||It's Menge…
   1044348|00000000||Temple Guard…
    497367|00000000||Thieving vermin to the confession chamber.
    497369|00000000||But, sir… What's the offense? This is some sorceress bitch's shop!
    497371|00000000||Think that gives you the right to steal her property?
    497373|00000000||Well… Sorcerers, mages of all types are outlaws…
    497375|00000000||But by law, the Temple Guard takes possession of their belongings. And the rule of law still holds in Novigrad.
    497465|00000000||You know a bat can sniff out a moth a mile away?
    417565|00000000||What the bloody hell was that?! Our guests are not to be touched!
    417571|00000000||What do we do with him?
    427274|00000000||End the fucker!
    427276|00000000||Bloodbath…
    427278|00000000||Buggerin' out of here!
    526092|00000000||The Vegelbuds alone maintain a certain standard in regard to elegant receptions.
    526094|00000000||Huh. Very true. Others claim it's inappropriate in a time of war…
    526096|00000000||Ahh, the things people won't say to excuse their own stinginess.
    526106|00000000||Don't listen to those demagogues. Radovid stands for stability.
    526108|00000000||He's a wonderful man, clearly… But something about his eyes…
    526110|00000000||Yes? What about them?
    526112|00000000||Duke Mormontre - do you remember? The one who held his daughters captive in his cellar?
    526114|00000000||He had eyes like that…
    526126|00000000||You still speak to her? After that horrible mismarriage?
    526128|00000000||Her father and I were chums, you see. I knew old Grimstone quite well.
    526130|00000000||What of it? He's dead, isn't he?
    497508|00000000||Think I plugged every hole in there.
    497509|00000000||All right. Get ready for some magic fireworks. Once I activate the incense, we'll have a moment to talk.
    424413|00000000||That's better.
    424501|00000000||Sheathe your sword. Now.
    424503|00000000||Mhm.
    424411|00000000||Put it away. I mean it.
   1067572|00000000||Got to admit, you have a way with trolls. Ever thought of having children?
   1067573|00000000||Children aren't trolls and vice versa. Besides, witchers're sterile.
   1067591|00000000||Ugh, you've not changed a bit.
   1067595|00000000||Still tart as rotting rhubarb.
   1064194|00000000||Just happen to be passin' through, or did someone send you to find me?
   1067597|00000000||Roche and Dijkstra.
   1067599|00000000||Ah! Mean they've not forgotten me? That's nice.
   1067607|00000000||Though I am grateful you came to get me, Geralt.
   1067609|00000000||Must have a lot on your mind, all those monsters to kill…
   1067611|00000000||Heard you three are planning to do some killing of your own.
   1067613|00000000||Huh? They tell you? Clowns.
   1067615|00000000||Kinda. Didn't offer any details, though.
   1067617|00000000||Maybe you'd be willing? Gesture of gratitude?
   1067623|00000000||Sorry, mate. If they were mum, I've got to be mum.
   1067625|00000000||Hm. Be that way.
   1067553|00000000||Truth be told, you didn't have to kill 'em.
   1067555|00000000||Looking for apprentices?
   1067557|00000000||Fuckin' hell, them? Don't even think about it. I'd kill myself with those idiots.
   1067559|00000000||But they were likeable as idiots go.
   1067561|00000000||Didn't have time for nonsense.
   1064196|00000000||How'd you even wind up out here?
   1067633|00000000||Nilfgaard occupied land now.
   1067635|00000000||You sayin' the Black Ones have no use for cobblers?
   1067637|00000000||Probably brought their own.
   1067639|00000000||Brought fuck all, as I see it. Amateurs in uniform.
   1067641|00000000||And you'll not find a better cobbler than Thaler anywhere in the North!
   1067649|00000000||Yeah, right.
   1067651|00000000||You doubt me?
   1067653|00000000||You're a spy. And you're working with Roche and Dijkstra now.
   1067655|00000000||Doubt you went out there to fix Nilfgaardian boots.
   1067657|00000000||Ah, I see you've thought about this.
   1067675|00000000||I admit it. Cobbler act's my cover.
   1067677|00000000||Who takes an interest in cobblers? No one.
   1067679|00000000||You sit there, doin' your work, hammerin' on that sole, and blokes beside you talk.
   1067681|00000000||Bollocks, mostly. But sometimes they'll say somethin' interestin'.
   1067683|00000000||Like?
   1067685|00000000||That's all I'm willin' to say.
   1071276|00000000||Johnny!
   1071278|00000000||Joohnnyy!
    448585|00000000||Not here. Something's not right. Gotta look around, might be hiding nearby.
    390163|00000000||Where can I find this Johnny?
    390181|00000000||Just tell me where I can find Johnny.
    390183|00000000||Johnny's made up.
    419420|00000000||Begone, begone.
   1062591|00000000||Farewell.
   1062593|00000000||Mhm… See you.
    390165|00000000||Just got one question for you.
    390167|00000000||Don't be askin' no questions. You're a stranger. Not allowed to talk to strangers.
    390169|00000000||Can we eat now? Soup with scratchings…
    390179|00000000||You hear? Says he's afeard of you. Stop scarin' my kids.
    390161|00000000||You don't want to talk to me?
    385515|00000000||Can't come in here. Not allowed in here.
    385517|00000000||I just wanna talk to the boy.
    385519|00000000||Not allowed. It's not allowed.
    415119|00000000||I won't talk to you anyway. Gran don't like you. An-- and Johnny's made up. An-- and strangers steal kids.
   1055774|00000000||Well, I've got bugger all to do here. Headin' back to the Rosemary.
   1055776|00000000||Got Poppy to feed, and then I suppose I'll wait - see if our warbler don't come home on his own. Take care, now.
   1065583|00000000||Wyvern. Wonderful.
   1065581|00000000||Could be a draconid's territory.
    499699|00000000||So what would you call this place?
    499711|00000000||So what would you call this dive?
    499713|00000000||Dunno… The Garden of Liberty, maybe?
    499715|00000000||For a man who shakes down beggars and thieves for tribute, you're quite the romantic.
    499717|00000000||You say "tribute," I say "taxes." You say "thieves," I say "hard-workin' street clerks."
    345199|00000000||Got something to take up with me?
    499691|00000000||Am I mistaken, or you got something to take up with me?
    499693|00000000||Who knows… Man with two swords and the skill to use 'em could be very useful these days.
    499695|00000000||Could've sent some underling to fetch me.
    499697|00000000||Could've. But I admit I wanted to see how you'd manage. See if you're as crafty as you are… well-crafted.
    499727|00000000||You don't stand a chance.
    499729|00000000||You face the Temple Guard and witch hunters, armed to the teeth. And all you've got's a gang of tramps and a handful of mages. I wouldn't bet a single crown on you.
    499731|00000000||Nor would I. Not at the moment. But war shuffles the deck. In wartime, folk start to understand things.
    499733|00000000||Start to wonder why magic's outlawed even though it's so damn useful.
    499735|00000000||Folk come to me, knowin' full well it's forbidden. You know why? 'Cause they fear death by disease more than torture.
    423372|00000000||I'm actually glad someone like you's found his way to our city. 'Cause it will be our city one day, Geralt. Mark my words.
    345161|00000000||Yours plural?
    423470|00000000||Yeah, mine… and me friends'.
    501286|00000000||But that's a tale for another time.
    489607|00000000||For now, I'll leave you two alone, 'cause I can see… well, you clearly need it.
    489609|00000000||Geralt, I have a lot of things to take care of in town.
    499679|00000000||I'll be glad to tag along.
    345203|00000000||A man with a vision.
    345205|00000000||One day the so-called free city of Novigrad will be truly free. But before that can happen, we gotta rid it of superstition.
    427940|00000000||Farting around about the hallowed essence of the Eternal Fire - nonsense for kiddies.
    499681|00000000||Apparently not. Cheering crowd at the execution - mostly adults.
    499683|00000000||Any crowd of rabble'll cheer to the stench of burning flesh. But one day folk'll understand the Eternal Fire's naught but a leash around their necks.
    499685|00000000||They call this place the Putrid Grove. But it's the rest of Novigrad that's putrefied. This here's the last bastion of normality, sanity, reason.
    499726|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    499719|00000000||See, witcher - I've got plans. Big plans. Far-reaching plans to reshape this city head to toe.
    499721|00000000||Ever thought of seeking a seat on the City Council?
    499723|00000000||City Council is a puppet troupe with the hierarchy of the Church of the Eternal Fire as its puppeteer. Until recently, that is, when Radovid and his witch hunters took the reins.
    499725|00000000||The semblance of power don't interest me.
    499701|00000000||Temple Guard tolerate your little operation?
    499705|00000000||Let's say they appreciate the value of a Novigrad crown.
    499707|00000000||Hm, Menge doesn't seem like the type that can be bought.
    499709|00000000||Anyone can be bought… but like as true - Menge'd cost me a fortune. Luckily he's got officers, and they're mere mortals.
    501288|00000000||Illnesses catch 'em at times - other times they wanna catch a bit o' diversion.
    499698|00000000||Temple Guard ever bother you?
    499687|00000000||Your spies tell you I was looking for the Putrid Grove?
    499689|00000000||My skull'd be a home for bottom-feedin' river fish if I didn't keep an ear to the ground. And please, "Putrid Grove"? Ugly name for our cozy little hideout, wouldn't you say?
    345201|00000000||Knew I was looking for you?
    487402|00000000||Bout time we made something clear, sorceress.
    487404|00000000||Yes. High time.
    487406|00000000||Me and my men'll manage just fine without the help of you or any other mages, but you - well, without our help you're sitting ducks for the Temple Guard.
    487409|00000000||Who do I spy...?
    487412|00000000||Geralt…?
    487414|00000000||Hey, Triss.
    487416|00000000||See you two know each other.
    492424|00000000||See you two know each other well. I was curious whether you'd manage to find me, witcher.
    572886|00000000||Ow! Don't pull!
    569030|00000000||Well, you wanted braids.
    572889|00000000||But I didn't want my hair pulled.
    572891|00000000||Can't have one without the other.
    572893|00000000||Then I don't want 'em.
    471725|00000000||Oughta have a chat with this pellar.
    471727|00000000||Fair warning - he's a hard man to talk to. Rumor has it he killed his own father with an axe as a lad, then went batty. Now they say he sees ghosts and ploughs his goat.
    472361|00000000||Not really interested in his hobbies. Just want to ask about the amulet.
    471695|00000000||I'm off to see the pellar.
    475538|00000000||So it is supposed to be Triss. Yeah, I see it now. Eerie. Looks just like her.
    475540|00000000||Doesn't it? Time's taken a bit of a toll, but overall, it continues to impress.
    475542|00000000||You got something to fall back on if things don't work out with Nilfgaard.
    475532|00000000||Resemblance is uncanny.
    475544|00000000||This is Triss? No offense, but uh… not great with your hands, are you?
    475556|00000000||Why don't you take some wood and rags, see what image of a grown woman you can come up with?
    475534|00000000||As I remember, Triss looks different.
    471697|00000000||Found a doll in Tamara's room. Tell me about it.
    471699|00000000||Heh! What could possibly be so interesting about a doll, witcher?
    471900|00000000||Looks like it might've been used for some sort of black magic. Where'd Tamara get it?
    471902|00000000||Black magic? Are you barmy?! I made it for her!
    475528|00000000||She was four, perhaps five winters old. We were in Vizima on market day and she saw the sorceress Triss Merigold. Insisted she must have a doll just like her.
    471956|00000000||Couldn't afford a thing of that sort, so I made the doll with me own hands.
    471687|00000000||Found a doll.
    471717|00000000||Found signs of a fight in the room. Know anything about that?
    471719|00000000||A fight? What're you talkin' about?
    475632|00000000||Someone was attacked - probably your wife or daughter. Whoever it was tried to defend themselves with a candlestick. Missed the attacker, punctured the wall, instead. They tussled, too.
    475634|00000000||I… I don't know nothin' about this. That night… I was drunk, don't remember a thing. They were gone by the time I awoke.
    475636|00000000||Doubt you were the only ones in the castle. Maybe one of your men heard something?
    472227|00000000||Three times I asked those bastards if they'd seen anythin', heard anythin'. Nothin', not a one of 'em.
    471691|00000000||Signs of a fight in the room.
   1057991|00000000||Whole landing smells of wine. Tell me anything about that?
   1057993|00000000||One of the lads, must be. Lushes one and all.
   1057995|00000000||Give your men Erveluce?
   1057997|00000000||Oh, dammit, I might've spilled it. I told you I was good and marinated that night. Why's it matter? Stench of wine in plenty a corner around the castle.
   1057985|00000000||Somebody spilled wine on the landing.
    471705|00000000||Hmm… can't help thinking I've missed something. Need to take another look.
    471693|00000000||Need to look around some more.
    475642|00000000||Know anything about this amulet?
    475644|00000000||Recognize this amulet?
    472308|00000000||Hmm… Yes. Anna began wearing it a time ago.
    472310|00000000||Any idea where she got it?
    472312|00000000||None.
    472314|00000000||Any witches or cunning women in the area?
    472316|00000000||A pellar. Old coot lives near Blackbough. And there's a cunning woman in Midcopse, but I know little about her - she's only recently arrived.
    475651|00000000||If Anna were to see someone, she'd choose the pellar, not the woman. Anna was wary of strangers, newcomers.
    177424|00000000||Done pokin' around?
    394146|00000000||Aim to look at the room or not?
   1025935|00000000||So, um… "The Uncensored Ars Amandi Position Almanac" - do you have it?
   1025937|00000000||I'm afraid not. It's on the banned books list. But… I've got something similar.
   1025939|00000000||The Collected Sermons of the Prophet Lebioda"
   1025941|00000000||Merely the cover. Nothing but engravings inside. So? I can give you a modest discount…
    439672|00000000||No! No, run! We’ve gotta go! They'll kill me!
    439674|00000000||Don't be afraid. You'll be fine.
    558633|00000000||Hark! A sound I hear! 'Tis right?
    561873|00000000||A spirit breaks the still of night!
    561875|00000000||Burn the incense ever higher!
    561877|00000000||Spirit, join us 'round the fire!
   1014077|00000000||Hullo, witcher.
   1014074|00000000||Come on, lads!
   1014072|00000000||You a jester?
   1001175|00000000||Haste makes waste. Culprit lost this crate, must've fallen off the wagon.
   1001179|00000000||Can you be certain this was the thief's?
    583600|00000000||Crossbow under the packages. Heh. Itching to crack a pun about every rosemary having its--
    583601|00000000||I appreciate you resisting the impulse. Hm, I've seen this guild mark. It's a trading company's, one that imports spices from Zerrikania.
   1015183|00000000||They've a storehouse at the docks. Northernmost one on this side of the port. Shall I meet you there?
   1015196|00000000||Sounds good.
   1063409|00000000||Can't get through here. Gotta keep looking.
    474449|00000000||Light. I must be close.
    432627|00000000||Well, well. Carduin of Lan Exeter, head of the Conclave of Mages. Or should I say the Conclave of Mages-Not-Yet-Turned-To-Ash-At-The-Stake?
    432629|00000000||What do you want?
   1012989|00000000||Seems to me it's a golden age for the Conclave, for mages in general, huh?
   1012990|00000000||We've seen the dawn of hard times for mages. The Conclave does everything in its power to help them survive.
   1012991|00000000||Is that a fact? Hm, as long as they don't mind being yoked and muzzled.
   1012992|00000000||And I say it's easy to play the hero, die a foolish death. But someone must survive, preserve our body of knowledge for future generations. You don't understand, you cannot… but sometimes it takes courage to be a coward.
   1012982|00000000||Conclave's blooming, happy days for you. Am I right?
   1012988|00000000||Farewell.
    432623|00000000||Farewell.
   1012981|00000000||Radovid pleased with the witch hunts?
   1012983|00000000||Radovid pleased with the witch hunts?
   1012984|00000000||No. And he shan't be until he sees Philippa Eilhart atop a pyre.
   1012985|00000000||Your king doesn't forget easily.
   1012986|00000000||Such things as she did to His Majesty are impossible to forget.
    432633|00000000||What now?
    570547|00000000||Greetings.
    570548|00000000||Naught of interest here.
    570549|00000000||Gods speed to ye.
    422824|00000000||Don't be shy, now. Looking doesn't cost a thing. There's plenty to behold: this here's a collection of wonders that belonged to the mage Aeramas! A once in a lifetime opportunity!
    422826|00000000||How'd you get ahold of these? Never heard of a mage willingly parting with his treasures.
    422828|00000000||No one asked Aeramas his will. He was burned at the stake a fortnight ago.
    422830|00000000||Strange they didn't burn his stuff with him. Witch hunters let you resell it, just like that?
    422832|00000000||Why wouldn't they…? These are common goods, some valuable only as collectibles, perhaps.
    422808|00000000||All right, I get it - these items aren't actually common.
    422810|00000000||Rumor has it each is an enchanted key.
    422812|00000000||Rumor happen to mention where to find the locks these keys open?
    422814|00000000||Sadly, no. Why, if I knew you could hardly expect me to sell them.
    422816|00000000||Where did Aeramas live?
    422818|00000000||Had a lovely residence south of Oxenfurt. Badly damaged now, as he made the hunters pay dearly for his skin.
    422604|00000000||Tell me about Aeramas' artefacts.
   1028767|00000000||To matters less controversial - wouldn't mind playing a few rounds of gwent.
   1028766|00000000||Care to play cards?
    422822|00000000||Farewell.
    422606|00000000||Farewell.
    422602|00000000||Show me what you have.
    422820|00000000||Show me what you have.
    422834|00000000||Welcome back!
    442234|00000000||So? Interested in some of Aeramas' mementos, after all? They're still for sale.
   1014097|00000000||Nice place.
   1014098|00000000||A witcher?! Are you after me, you've a contract?
   1015467|00000000||No. Found this place by accident.
   1015469|00000000||Mhm. Want something?
   1014113|00000000||What's with all the flowers?
   1014114|00000000||I shall make honey, like the forest succubus I am, silly.
   1015464|00000000||What do you think they're for? They're pretty! Monsters have aesthetic preferences, too, you know.
   1015508|00000000||If you see one that you fancy, please take it. I like to share.
   1014103|00000000||What's with the flowers?
   1014105|00000000||Farewell.
   1014104|00000000||Farewell.
   1014102|00000000||The man - who is he?
   1014110|00000000||This man - who is he?
   1014112|00000000||My lover. Or rather one of my many. I usually chase them away once I'm done with them… But I let this one stay - he doesn't snore.
   1014100|00000000||You again? What do you want?
   1078656|463bc0c4||Mad Kiyan
    416250|00000000||What is this? What? Nothin' for you here. Stay away from the kids!
   1050110|05992f9f||Boris
   1049531|00000000||Might I at least fetch his body?
   1049533|00000000||Wouldn't advise it, it's dangerous. If you decide to go anyway… it's near his snares.
   1049535|00000000||Thank ye… Farewell.
    426285|00000000||Can't accept this.
    426289|00000000||Can't accept this coin. I'm sorry I wasn't able to bring him back alive.
    426287|00000000||Thanks. And I truly am sorry.
    426283|00000000||Thank you.
    442336|00000000||You didn't find him?
    426279|00000000||No, I did, but…
    426281|00000000||Naye, don't say it. It's clear from your face. Please, take this coin.
   1049539|00000000||Ah, 'tis you… Greetin's.
   1037680|00000000||Leave him alone.
   1037681|00000000||Cleaver'll pay extra for killin' the witcher. Well, hop to it, lads! Havnae got all day!
   1037677|00000000||Leave him alone.
   1037682|00000000||Right. Just on our way out.
   1037678|00000000||We were just leaving.
   1037674|00000000||Greetings, Bilzen. We've a message for you from the boss.
   1039624|00000000||Message? What kind o' message?
   1037676|00000000||Mister Cleaver's very unhappy.
   1037675|00000000||Now just a minute! If any discrepancies've cropped up in the books, I can explain everything.
   1039633|00000000||Too late. Grab 'im! And you two - get lost!
   1063128|00000000||Wait now. Leavin' already? Where's that bottle you went to fetch?
   1037482|00000000||Zoltan? Time we were on our way.
   1037671|00000000||Hehh, aye, 'spose so. It's grown late.
    571710|00000000||The Eternal Fire be with ye!
    571712|00000000||I place my hope in the Eternal Fire.
    571714|00000000||Argh, tough times.
   1032793|00000000||One day a mother found her infant dying at her side.
   1032795|00000000||Despair gripped her, and sought to find a medic. Fortunately her husband explained no medic would help the child.
   1032797|00000000||And he took the babe and placed it before the Flame of the Eternal Fire.
   1032799|00000000||And the child was healed the next day, and lives still, the apple of his parents' eye.
    398948|00000000||Thank you. If you had not come…
    400301|00000000||If I'd not come, only one man would've died. Really going back to your wife?
    456058|00000000||Yes… she bore a child just before the war started. A girl - I named her Beatrys, after her grandmother.
    455928|00000000||Why… Why did you help me?
    458827|00000000||It was the lesser evil… I think.
    458823|00000000||It was the lesser evil.
    458821|00000000||I hate lynch mobs.
    458825|00000000||Lynch mobs - nothing good ever comes of them.
    458829|00000000||Now go. Stay off the highroads and give any villages a wide berth - until you cross the Yaruga.
    455939|00000000||I must flee… More will come…
   1013702|00000000||Good luck to you.
   1013810|00000000||Likewise! Now, that's the sportin' spirit! Not like that half-elf over there, who's been shootin' me murderous glares this whole time, heheh.
   1013680|00000000||Good luck.
   1013700|00000000||So you're really a farmer?
   1013776|00000000||You really a farmer?
   1013778|00000000||I not look it? Got a little farmstead just outside the city. Could sit there for days just watchin' things grow.
   1013785|00000000||What's with the… smell?
   1013787|00000000||The smell?
   1013790|00000000||Anywho, mushrooms're all well and good, but one's gotta get away at times. My lady, she was in tears, said I'd get my throat slit in Novigrad…
   1013811|00000000||But I says to her, I says, "Hortensia, what a chance! The best players! The rarest cards!" She had to let me go.
    579947|00000000||I'm new to this, too.
   1013678|00000000||Took me ages to squirrel away the coin for the buy-in. Mushrooms are no quick route to riches, heheh.
    490742|00000000||Find the parcel, or did you get wet for no reason?
    499782|00000000||Nothing like a refreshing swim in a filthy canal.
    490740|00000000||Found a few fish, a rusty anchor, the carcass of a boat… Oh, and this.
    490741|00000000||My package. Hope the contents aren't soaked through. You're a doll.
    480868|00000000||Current must've carried the sack seaward. I'll swim towards the port. Coming with?
    480869|00000000||Maybe some other time.
    499780|00000000||Don't know what you're missing. Water's thick with pungent oils. Guessing it'll do wonders for my complexion.
    480852|00000000||Judging by what Kluhg said, the parcel should be around here, on the bottom. Unless the poor man was mistaken. He's been forgetful ever since Menge interrogated him. Seems to be suffering from a persecution complex, too.
   1071301|00000000||We must give her a moment, let her gather her wits.
   1072439|00000000||Once she has calmed, we return to Novigrad.
   1071303|00000000||Yes, sir.
   1053191|00000000||Where you headed, miss?
   1053193|00000000||Leave me alone! I've shown you my pass!
   1053195|00000000||Then maybe you could show us somethin' else? Gets a little dull here…
   1053197|00000000||Aye. And as I see it you could be smugglin' somethin' under them skirts…
   1053199|00000000||Touch me and I'll scream so loud they'll hear me in Novigrad!
   1053201|00000000||And they say lasses love a man in uniform…
   1025952|00000000||Knife looks like it's attached to the tabletop.
   1072967|00000000||Drawer's open… Hmm…
   1008035|00000000||We're talking. Can't you see?
    473074|00000000||You're not growing any younger, Gremist. You must pass your knowledge on.
    473076|00000000||I'm no trout that must get to its spawning ground - I shall do what I please. Now leave me be!
   1043599|00000000||Bollocks! It was that priest, Nathaniel.
   1043602|00000000||Eternal Fire…
   1043604|00000000||Eternal Fire's nice and all, but it was the witcher did in the sadist.
   1043607|00000000||Bollocks! It was Hubert Rejk, the city coroner.
   1043592|00000000||Know the butcher who was gougin' out eyes and cuttin' open bellies? Word is he's done bit the dust.
   1043594|00000000||Thunderin' thatches! Did the Temple Guard catch him?
   1043596|00000000||Witch hunters, more like. Apparently, he was some sort o' warlock.
   1043608|00000000||Always wanted to be a woman o' the world, and here I am, about to become a housewife…
   1043610|00000000||Oh, you'll do your share o' travelin' still…
   1043612|00000000||How's that?
   1043614|00000000||To fetch him beer.
   1039232|00000000||C'mon, quick! Unbind me!
   1045997|00000000||Hey! What the fuck?! Come back, you prick!
    504824|00000000||What? Naye, don't leave me! Get back here! You arselickin' whoreson!
   1005172|00000000||Last time I'm askin'.
   1005270|00000000||Last chance - what happened to the Nilfgaardians? What's behind that door?
   1005303|00000000||Gimme the key to the door.
   1005304|00000000||You'd go in?
   1018487|00000000||No, wanna pour wax through its head, tell you your fortune. Now gimme the key.
   1018489|00000000||So, correct me if I'm wrong.
   1018490|00000000||You dug through to the monster's lair. Then buried the entrance, but the Nilfgaardians opened it again to look for treasure.
   1018491|00000000||Beast killed the Black Ones and returned to it's lair. You wanted to bury the corpses, but their stench lured ghouls to the village. Now I'm here. Sound about right?
   1018492|00000000||Tis as you say, yes.
   1018493|00000000||I'm going down there. If I'm gone long - run. Barring the door, nailing it shut - resolves nothing. There're other ways out of the tunnels, gotta be.
   1005301|00000000||Gimme the key.
   1005302|00000000||The beast - what did it look like?
   1005305|00000000||What'd the monster look like?
   1005306|00000000||Twere dark down below, couldn't see.
   1018495|00000000||So how'd it kill the Nilfgaardians?
   1018497|00000000||I ran, couldn't watch it happen.
   1061939|00000000||What do I know?
   1061941|00000000||Listen, you. If you don't tell me everything you know, you could all die, understand? Is that a burden you can live with?
   1005272|00000000||There's tunnels beneath the village…
   1005273|00000000||Tunnels?
   1005274|00000000||Elven ruins. We scavenge 'em for trinkets, small treasures, sell them to Novigrad merchants. No one expected anythin' bad to come of it.
   1005276|00000000||We dug through some rubble, found a chamber. A beast slept inside. We felled the props so the ceiling'd collapse. Didn't bury the monster, though…
   1005271|00000000||You're all still in danger. And only I can help. I'm the only one who can rid you of this threat.
   1005171|00000000||You're still in danger.
   1005168|00000000||There's nothin' there.
   1005169|00000000||Tracks lead to this house. What happened here?
   1005170|00000000||What do you mean, what happened?
    462762|00000000||Do what you will. I'm not about to get involved.
    462764|00000000||Give him his things… and toss in something from those transports. Wise decisions should be rewarded. Va fail.
    462758|00000000||Do as you will.
    462766|00000000||That sense of moral superiority - tiresome… and wrong. You're common bandits.
    462768|00000000||Is that so? Then we shall treat you as common bandits would. Divedde vatt'ghern!
    462760|00000000||You're common bandits.
    462746|00000000||Might not trouble you. But the Redanians're convinced something prowls these woods. Hired me to kill it.
    462752|00000000||Well they're mistaken. It's not the first time. There's no monster here, your work is done.
   1051120|00000000||This isn't a game. Men have died.
   1051122|00000000||Soldiers have died. Radovid's soldiers, serving the man who torments the Aen Seidhe from the Great Sea to the Blue Mountains. Soldiers who joined in massacres, tortured our brothers, raped our sisters. I shan't cry for them.
   1051124|00000000||And we'll not stop attacking those transports. We must eat, same as you. So you've a choice… Leave now and forget what you've seen. Or die.
    462726|00000000||Vatt'ghern? Strange. No monsters trouble us.
   1064304|00000000||Now where the hell…?
   1071965|00000000||Hm. Strange…
    352185|00000000||Looks uninhabited.
   1050637|c80d681a||Snow Hare
    437759|00000000||Where's Eustace? It was him always hauled the corpses.
    437761|00000000||Aye, he did. Plenty more to haul now, so we work shifts. Crematory's fire roars day and night.
    437763|00000000||Good. City needs cleanin'. With steel and fire!
    450091|00000000||If you want it clean, let me pass. Got shit and puss leakin' from me wagon.
    450095|00000000||Oh, aye… Right away.
    437751|00000000||This one's still breathin'.
    437755|00000000||Aye, it is, let it. Some still breathe as I toss 'em in the fire.
    437757|00000000||Orders say not a living soul's to leave without a pass.
    450089|00000000||We can wait till it dies. There's no rush.
   1074783|00000000||Bastards deserved it.
   1074785|00000000||Call the Guard! Why's no one tryin' to put it out?!
   1074787|00000000||Good folk?! What's with yous?!
   1074789|00000000||Let 'em burn. Took my sister, the bastards.
   1074791|00000000||I've their clothin', brought it to me to launder.
   1074900|00000000||Wonder if they'll still be needin' it?
   1074793|00000000||Burn, you buggers. Like all the poor folk you've burnt.
   1074781|00000000||What a waste of wood… Enough for seven winters, there.
   1037125|00000000||Covered in frost. Cold must've killed the bees.
   1039543|00000000||Clear paw prints. Left by something large and heavy.
   1037127|00000000||Apiarian phantom's got large feet… And it's pretty damn heavy.
   1037141|00000000||Must be where the farmhand died.
   1037133|00000000||Blood… Dried and blackened, so several days old.
   1037220|00000000||Tracks disappear in the water. Doubt anything's hiding in this puddle they call a lake.
   1037222|00000000||Need to check the other side, see if the trail goes on.
   1037822|00000000||Show me a pond, and I'll show you the drowners. But they didn't destroy the hives.
   1037823|00000000||Can't squeeze through here. Gotta find another way in.
   1038210|00000000||Hmm… Whoever's building this probably lives nearby. I should talk to them.
   1074039|00000000||Hm… Wonder where these clues'll lead me…
    411515|d13ecc0f||Nightwraith
   1052292|00000000||You heard? He finally met his match! Some cutthroat, a witcher, I think, gave Junior his due!
   1052294|00000000||So? Nothing to cheer about, as I see things.
   1052296|00000000||Why?! He'd stolen so much, killed so many!
   1052298|00000000||Another'll take his place. Just as bad, or worse. Our only hope's for Nilfgaard to come to town, bring some order.
    573937|00000000||See what I can do.
    573938|00000000||We'll pay you. The boys and me, we pooled what we had for a reward.
    568038|00000000||Bodies buried yet? Where?
    568039|00000000||Orders were to burn 'em. Our medic was to take a look first - talk to him. He's at the docks now.
    568035|00000000||Where are the bodies?
    568036|00000000||What did the corpses look like?
    568037|00000000||I've not seen anythin' like it in my life, and I've seen a lot of corpses. Ever heard talk of folk who died in the deserts of Zerrikania? From the heat alone?
    592293|00000000||These corpses came straight outta those tales.
    568034|00000000||The corpses - tell me about them.
   1067807|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1067809|00000000||Let's talk about my pay first. I know what my services are worth.
   1067829|00000000||You might know the value of your services, but I know the limit of our funds. We're not rich men, just town guards.
   1067831|00000000||That's better, but still too much.
   1067835|00000000||Piss off! Offer stands as it was - take it or leave it.
   1067833|00000000||All right… I believe I can pay you that. Provided, of course, that you do… well.
    567896|00000000||I'm here about the contract.
    567897|00000000||Ah. Well, a night patrol got massacred. Tough men, the lot, armed to the teeth. A beast, must be.
    567898|00000000||Must? What makes you say that?
    574036|00000000||If you'd seen the corpses…
    567878|00000000||Here about the job.
    568114|00000000||In any case, the succubus is dead. Here's proof.
    568130|00000000||And here's your reward. As promised.
    568131|00000000||Farewell.
    568115|00000000||Anyway, succubus won't harm anyone anymore. Here's proof.
    568128|00000000||Masterful work, witcher.
    568109|00000000||Guards were killed by a succubus.
    568110|00000000||Su- succubus? In Novigrad? How? Light of the Eternal Fire protects the city!
    568111|00000000||Must've gone out a few times recently…
    567879|00000000||I know how the guards died.
   1016408|00000000||Farewell.
    567880|00000000||Farewell.
    567877|00000000||Hm?
   1014095|00000000||Won't bother you then.
   1014123|00000000||Don't let me bother you, then.
    579965|00000000||I can see that.
    579966|00000000||This will certainly serve me better than your conversation with Sasha has served you. I'd be wary of her.
   1014115|00000000||Yeah, can see that…
   1014094|00000000||Apologies, but I must focus my thoughts before the match.
   1014166|00000000||Ahahahaha.
   1048327|00000000||Dammit, it's not here…? Must've fled through another exit. Gotta nab it before it gets away.
   1048329|00000000||There it is… Won't get away this time.
   1048323|00000000||Hid in the cave, not about to leave… Bomb should smoke it out, though.
    530662|00000000||Aristo-scum, you'll regret ever settin' your stockinged feet around here!
    531557|00000000||No protector's gonna help you!
    530659|00000000||Grab the fancy man! Don't let 'im escape!
    501460|00000000||Sorceresses - no greater pleasure to be had in interrogation. Love it.
    501461|00000000||Word is Menge's gonna issue an order - ban us from having our fun.
    501524|00000000||Why would he do that?
    501526|00000000||Says they're to suffer, whereas the cunts just dream of getting ploughed well and good.
    501528|00000000||Argh, he exaggerates. Besides, we do his dirty work and deserve a bloody reward, am I right?
   1025810|00000000||I've everything invested in asymmetric derivative instruments.
   1025812|00000000||Derivative instruments… Is this… related to music?
   1025814|00000000||Hah, no, they're financial tools. In a nutshell, you pay for goods before they're produced.
   1025816|00000000||So, essentially… you buy a pig in a poke? Hm, thanks but no thanks.
   1025860|00000000||Well, look who's here! Eugen Trapp! I thought you disdained bathhouses.
   1025862|00000000||I do. But my doctor's prescribed this. Shoulder pain, you know, hot water's apparently the best remedy.
   1025864|00000000||You know what's even better, old sport, is a Zerrikanian massage. I highly recommend it… though your dear wife needn't know!
   1017662|00000000||The witch, she tol' me I were to… edicate yous. Which I now strive to do.
   1017664|00000000||To keep the pox off youse, you're to… see to your own - what is it… hygiene. And don't drink straight from your wells.
   1017666|00000000||Huh?
   1017668|00000000||Just wash your arse once a week and boil your water over a fire!
   1028747|00000000||How about a game of gwent?
    421043|00000000||Huh. Farewell.
    421039|00000000||Farewell.
    421037|00000000||What're you offering?
    421041|00000000||Got anything interesting?
    421035|00000000||What?
   1073029|00000000||{Laddhe en! Peiwch a gadvael iddo aen car'harion! } [Kill him! Do not let him near the prisoners!]
   1073556|00000000||Deep ruts… Loggers' wagon must've stopped here.
   1073564|00000000||Then they went down this road, probably towards their clearing.
   1056120|00000000||Clawed the rock. Must've been angry… and strong.
   1014059|00000000||Greetings.
   1014061|00000000||Cut him down!
   1014063|00000000||What's the meaning of this, eh?
    436812|00000000||Job's done…
    436814|00000000||True enough. Here's your pay. And thanks for your help.
    468504|00000000||Farewell.
    436797|00000000||You promised payment.
    436799|00000000||Gotta remove those bodies.
    436816|00000000||Next time you kill someone, bury the bodies. Deep. Need to take care of these, too, or they'll attract more corpse eaters.
    436818|00000000||We'll do it. Thank you, master witcher.
    436808|00000000||Use that barn as a cemetery?
    468117|00000000||Uhh… No… Why d'you ask?
    468140|00000000||Found human remains inside. Several sets. They're what drew the necrophages.
    436810|00000000||They was… They was bandits. When it were just coin they took, we lived and let live, so to speak…
    468142|00000000||But when they dragged Heddy to the barn, we wouldn't take no more! Grabbed our pitchforks and… well, you seen how it ended.
    465781|00000000||Help me!
    465783|00000000||Not a bit of bloody privacy to be had.
    575637|00000000||You're a terrible actor.
    575688|00000000||That was some pretty bad acting. Really oughta explore other career options. Petty theft, maybe?
    575693|00000000||Argh. Always the same old shit.
    575691|00000000||You dare insult an officer on duty? Let me give you some advice, mutant--
    591895|00000000||Look who's talking! I know you're a doppler. And a kleptomaniac.
    591897|00000000||Merchants put out a contract on me?!
    575638|00000000||Nice scent. And here I thought Temple guards were unkempt boors.
    575636|00000000||Nice scent.
    575583|00000000||Rare sight - an elf and a guard of the Eternal Fire having a friendly chat…
    575584|00000000||Friendly? Nothing further from the truth. This racist here has demanded to search me! For no reason at all!
    575585|00000000||You's a nonhuman, I need no other reason! Lucky I didn't find anything on you. Now piss off to the woods, go play your flute!
    480948|00000000||Free City of Novigrad - name actually used to mean something.
    480949|00000000||The very reason so many mages came here after the massacre at Loc Muinne.
    493040|00000000||Thought they'd be safe from Radovid's reapers. Instead they jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.
    493042|00000000||But Novigrad stands atop a mountain of coin, and winning a war takes three things: Coin, coin and even more coin.
    493044|00000000||That's why they're exterminating mages, confiscating their property and possessions. And they'll go after nonhumans next.
    480978|00000000||The elves occupy slums, but the dwarves practically control financial life in the city.
    493047|00000000||Official word is that Novigrad'll remain neutral. Somehow doubt anyone believes that anymore.
    558053|00000000||What's wrong?
    558054|00000000||It'll pass… That took… a great deal of Power.
    567633|00000000||If you can't go on…
    567636|00000000||You can't leave me here!
    567638|00000000||I'd never do that.
    567620|00000000||If you can't go on…
    567619|00000000||Just don't faint on me.
    567622|00000000||Just don't faint on me.
    567658|00000000||Now, in your firm embrace? Not on your life.
    567672|00000000||Ahem. Love to be able to say we could stay here awhile and rest…
    567674|00000000||I know, I know. We must go on.
   1004897|00000000||Blimey, pumpkin kick me stupid…
   1004898|00000000||What's wrong now?
   1004899|00000000||I've had it! I'm packin' me things, goin' to me brother's in Oxenfurt…
   1004900|00000000||Don't be daft. Blockades on the Pontar, Redanians won't let none through.
   1004901|00000000||You'll not venture far. And a birchin's what you'll get on arrival.
    568766|00000000||Of course. Let's go.
    570378|00000000||She's late, of course. She knew how important this night was to me!
   1003511|00000000||Course she did. Probably just making herself gorgeous. Takes time, you know.
   1003515|00000000||So it's true - a woman's vanity knows no bounds.
   1003763|00000000||Agh - Master Dandelion! Priscilla - she's--!
   1003765|00000000||What?! Speak, man!
   1003767|00000000||She's badly hurt. Been attacked. They took her to Vilmerius Hospital.
   1003769|00000000||Attacked? She's h-hurt?! Geralt, come with me. Please.
    568764|00000000||Of course.
    568765|00000000||Join you in a little.
    568776|00000000||Meet you there… soon.
    568777|00000000||Good. I'll… I'm off.
    437921|00000000||Name.
    437923|00000000||Carlo. Carlo Rycher.
    450128|00000000||Any mages in your family? Alchemists? Herbalists?
    450130|00000000||No. Father was a stove-fitter. Mother… Mother stayed home.
    450132|00000000||What about elves? Any elves?
    450134|00000000||Gods no! We only crossed horses and asses in my village. We took care human blood stayed pure!
    496078|00000000||Where's Dandelion?
    496080|00000000||Hah! Like to know that meself! Maybe he could explain what the hell's goin' on!
    496088|00000000||I just barely returned, as you saw. Expectin' to come home to a hot leg o' boar and some cold ale. What do I find instead? A shitestorm.
    496082|00000000||Dandelion gone, the tavern chock full of bums. Haven't a clue what happened.
    496114|00000000||Hmm… Let's look around. Might find something that'll put us on his trail.
    496116|00000000||Prime idea. I say we start on the ground floor. It's where he sat and wrote.
    493557|00000000||Where's Dandelion?
    496112|00000000||It's about Ciri.
    495692|00000000||I know she came to Novigrad. Might still be here.
    495702|00000000||You mean, she's come back? I'll be damned. I wonder if I'd recognize her… How many years is it now? Six? Seven?
    495704|00000000||But what'd she be doin' here?
    495712|00000000||Hiding, probably. She might be in danger.
    495713|00000000||See her in your dreams?
    495714|00000000||Couple times. Her, and the Wild Hunt.
    496042|00000000||Ooh… not good.
    496099|00000000||Not at all. But I know she came here and contacted Dandelion.
    496101|00000000||We've a wee problem, then…
    496109|00000000||I'm looking for Ciri.
    493558|00000000||I'm looking for Ciri.
    493562|00000000||There's a few things…
    493565|00000000||Let me guess: Triss? Yennefer, perchance?
    495685|00000000||Triss and I… talked. Cleared some things up.
    495686|00000000||As for Yennefer, well…
    495688|00000000||So you found her! Hah! Need to tell me all about it!
    495693|00000000||I will, some other time. Got something a tinge more important to take care of now.
    496045|00000000||Meaning?
    493559|00000000||A couple things…
    512190|00000000||Rather not worry you.
    512192|00000000||Ugh. Got some problems. Rather not burden you.
    512194|00000000||Fuck off, Geralt. Need to spill your guts to me, now.
    491709|00000000||I'm pleased. That went well.
    493550|00000000||Now we can greet each other like the gods ordained! Ages, pal!
    491710|00000000||Hey, Zoltan. You look good.
    493554|00000000||Trainin' plenty lately. What with the war on, no Mahakaman mead to be found, but Redanian lager's standin' in just fine.
    493555|00000000||You, though - you've withered a bit. Somethin' worryin' you?
    571704|00000000||Ayyyye?
    571706|00000000||Gotta find me some work.
    571708|00000000||Bein' a priest, now that's a soft gig…
    421109|00000000||Could use a few potion ingredients. Show me what you got.
    349622|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421111|00000000||So long.
    349632|00000000||So long.
   1012067|00000000||Villagers visit often?
   1012127|00000000||Folk from the village come here often?
   1012129|00000000||Oooh, when help they need, the pellar they seek.
   1012131|00000000||Help with what?
   1012167|00000000||With the dead that come a-haunting, peace must be made. But they must then wait for Forefathers' Eve.
   1012168|00000000||Or when an evil spirit runs wild in a homestead. Drive the spirit off, the pellar can.
   1012215|00000000||And if I needed, say, a love potion?
   1012217|00000000||Then to the witch you would be sent. Not a matter for the pellar, that.
    349711|00000000||White Wolf, wise wolf. What is it the wolf needs?
   1018175|00000000||After what you have done, witcher, you dare to the pellar come?
   1013385|00000000||For Mahakam!
   1013383|00000000||Dwarves are immune to magic!
   1013381|00000000||Everything all right?
   1013377|00000000||What's up with him?
   1013371|00000000||Water is a poison.
   1013369|00000000||Ah, greetings.
    385912|00000000||Aww…
    580042|00000000||Dammit… They're here already.
    562397|00000000||What're you doing here?
    562398|00000000||What? This 'un fly in from the moon? We're makin' offerin's to the Allgod, clearly.
   1061407|00000000||Ah, right. Know him. Personally, even.
   1061409|00000000||Tain't true, is it?! Ye seen 'im with your own gawkers?!
    562409|00000000||You too can seek His aid… That's if you've got fittin' offerin's. He scorned ours, then cursed the whole village.
    562413|00000000||But he don't answer. To our thinkin', he's grown angry with our pitiful offerin's, abandoned Velen.
   1043241|00000000||Nothin's changed, master witcher. Allgod still refuses our offerin's… Curse ain't lifted, not nowheres.
    562457|00000000||Well, I s'pose it can't hurt to try… To speak with him, you've to stand afore the altar and cry out, "Allgod! Help a poor wretch in need!" Who knows, he might just listen to a foreigner.
    562456|00000000||I could intercede on your behalf with this Allgod of yours. Got a feeling we'd come to an understanding.
    562450|00000000||I could have a chat with this Allgod.
    562464|00000000||Can't help you at the moment… except with a bit of advice. Find a god who prefers incense to bacon.
    562451|00000000||Can't help you just now.
    562443|00000000||So, what's wrong with your offerings?
    562444|00000000||Ye needn't mock us. Ye can see right well we've brought scraps. 'Fore the war, I wouldn't give this such to me hounds… But what can we do? Such're the times.
    562445|00000000||And they're like to get worse. Allgod said if he don't get a rafter o' bacon and a barrel o' beer at least, the rivers'll fill up with frogs, and lotusks or somesuch'll devour the harvest!
    562421|00000000||Your offerings - what was wrong with 'em?
    562472|00000000||Got good news. Your god's dead. It was actually a run-of-the-mill monster - sentient but mean, took advantage of you. You went hungry, while it grew new chins.
    562475|00000000||What've you done! The Allgod warned us… Said if he ever departed death would await us all! C'mon, Trebor, we must tell the others… Only group prayer can save us now.
    562422|00000000||Your Allgod's dead.
   1008346|00000000||He will. Promised to be pleased with whatever you bring.
   1008348|00000000||Told ye! Told ye the Allgod's merciful, understanding! Thanks, witcher!
   1008350|00000000||Oh, one last thing… did you know there's a crypt beneath this hill? Might wanna take a look sometime. Architecture's fascinating.
   1043185|00000000||Did you know there's a crypt below?
   1043189|00000000||Farewell. The Allgod show you favor.
   1043186|00000000||Farewell.
   1008342|00000000||Sadly, the Allgod wouldn't bend. Seems this shepherd's got a stern hand for his flock.
   1008344|00000000||Told ye, Trebor… Won't move 'im with tears. We gotta empty our larders.
    562486|00000000||Talked to your Allgod. Face to face.
    562487|00000000||And? Will he show us mercy?
    562423|00000000||Talked to your Allgod.
    562507|00000000||So long.
    562425|00000000||Farewell.
    562424|00000000||Your Allgod - tell me more.
    562432|00000000||The Allgod, you call him. First I've heard. This some new deity?
    562433|00000000||Nay, 'tis ancient, revered by our forefathers. They say it were like this: Roslav of Oreton came here to gather brushwood. Suddenly, for no reason, a bush burst into flame! Then Roslav heard a voice from the ground, demandin' offerin's and obedience!
   1007802|00000000||We been comin' 'ere since then, bearin' gifts. In exchange for which the Allgod watches over us, keeps us from evil.
   1007804|00000000||Mhm. Plain to see, that.
    562403|00000000||Anythin' new?
   1061661|00000000||Tell us, master… Were he terrible angered at our meagre offerin's?
    516614|5c4be19a||Alchemist
   1001239|00000000||We can probably climb in through there. Oughta show Sasha.
    389161|00000000||Blasphemers, dog's blood. Should all be flogged! Legs torn from their arses!
   1075443|00000000||My sweet boy! Have mercy, take pity an old woman!
    498415|00000000||Wolf hairs. At this altitude? Strange.
   1064298|00000000||What ye doin'?
   1064300|00000000||Greasing my blade.
    496562|00000000||There. We'll see just how effective Uncle Vesemir's formulae are.
   1064295|00000000||All right. I have everything. Now for a spot where I can build a fire, brew the oil in peace.
    495486|00000000||She needs help.
    478533|00000000||Oof. That was close.
   1064316|00000000||I must leave this place.
    498388|00000000||Hmm, massacred… by something with immense claws.
   1073853|00000000||Hm, it's dead. But a pig here? Must be a human settlement nearby.
   1073855|00000000||Hm… Belly's all in blood. Clawed open. No wolves did this.
   1054100|00000000||Listen! Went to see that tomb… all by meself.
   1054104|00000000||Entered the cave - all were quiet. Walked on, looked - and behold! Tombstone's been slid aside!
   1054106|00000000||Ye think the dragon slayer's risen from the grave? Come back to kill more o' the beasts?
   1054108|00000000||Ye seen any around lately? No! 'Cause he beat me to 'em, the ploughin' tin man!
   1054092|00000000||Thought we might peek in the dragon slayer's tomb. Whaddaya say?
   1054094|00000000||Can't kill the filth pesterin' us with me shovel. Just wonderin' - might be a sword for the takin' there.
   1054096|00000000||And I'm wondering just how ye expect to get in there. Ploughin' beast's nest is in them hills!
   1054098|00000000||Sides, I don't like to loot stiffs. Buggers haunt me dreams afterwards.
    590128|00000000||What did they talk about?
    590175|00000000||I get that right? Philippa say she wants to restore her vision?
    590178|00000000||Seems she was planning to grow tissue on precious stones.
    590333|00000000||Makes sense. Found agates covered in blood in her hideout.
    590344|00000000||If she pulled it off, she'd only be the second person in the world to do so.
    590177|00000000||But the bit about the Lodge - that's what I found interesting.
    590630|00000000||Bet Radovid would love to get this crystal.
    563405|00000000||Don't see why I shouldn't give it to Radovid.
    563409|00000000||Don't see why not. I was supposed to bring him Philippa, true, but he might be happy with this.
    563411|00000000||I sincerely hope you're not serious. Radovid hates mages, Philippa especially!
    590132|00000000||If she falls into his hands, she won't get out alive this time.
    590157|00000000||It's not like they said anything specific.
    590159|00000000||Radovid is holding mages captive. He'll force them to extract more from the crystal.
    590161|00000000||You're overreacting. Besides, Philippa's not one to make the same mistake twice.
    590163|00000000||Geralt, think this through…
    590165|00000000||I will. Thanks for your help.
    590155|00000000||You're overreacting.
    590154|00000000||You're right, take the crystal.
    590168|00000000||You're right, this could put the Redanians back on her trail…
    563407|00000000||Probably better if you keep it.
    590167|00000000||Much better. It'll be safe with me.
    590171|00000000||I'll try to cast a diagnostic spell, maybe learn something more.
    590173|00000000||Good luck.
    563403|00000000||You should keep the crystal.
    590130|00000000||You're not going to give it to him, are you?
    590632|00000000||"Our" opinions? You'd join them really?
    590641|00000000||No, I've got other plans.
    590643|00000000||So, what will you do with the crystal?
    590649|00000000||Haven't decided… Bet Radovid would be very interested in it…
    590629|00000000||Do you want to join the Lodge?
    590357|00000000||Meaning what, exactly?
    590358|00000000||The names they mentioned - all the most powerful sorceresses. Former members of the Lodge. They clearly mean to revive it.
    590599|00000000||That good or bad?
    590601|00000000||Depends for who.
    590623|00000000||Philippa's always said that "if magic perishes, so shall this world." And the Lodge was to protect the mages and their interests.
    590625|00000000||Radovid and the emperor, on the other hand, would not be pleased. Both would have to respect our opinions, and neither likes to share power.
    590354|00000000||What was so interesting about it?
    590353|00000000||Bet Radovid would love to get this crystal.
    563425|00000000||Hmm, guessing Radovid would love to get his hands on this…
    590127|00000000||Bet Radovid would love to get this crystal.
    563431|00000000||That's it. That's all I could recover.
    452941|00000000||Remember that crazy old woman who looked after the kids?
    452944|00000000||Gran? Sure I remember.
    452963|00000000||Found her in the Crones' village. Transformed into a monster. Any idea how that happened?
    453131|00000000||There's something in that cellar. The key to finding out what happened to Gran, I think.
    453155|00000000||Will you help her?
    453157|00000000||Provided it's not too late.
    453159|00000000||Thanks, Johnny. And good luck to you.
    453174|00000000||Likewise. And if you happen on any water hags, give 'em a nice, fat walloping on me behalf. Farewell, witcher.
    453096|00000000||I'm going back. Gotta see Anna. Thanks.
    453091|00000000||What now?
    453102|00000000||You escaped. Consider yourself lucky.
    453104|00000000||I do. But I've not lost the Ladies for long. If I'm to live, I must hide, and I can forget my cozy hole. It's the first place they’ll look if they set out to nab me.
   1072028|00000000||Try deeper in the swamp, maybe?
   1072030|00000000||Argh. I suppose I must. And what will you do?
    453024|00000000||Stay in the chest until the Crones left?
    453026|00000000||Wanted to. "Sit tight and quiet," said to meself. "Not a peep out your beak till they go." But then Gran fell to the floor. Started screaming and tearing her hair out.
    453077|00000000||Didn't know what to do. So I leapt out of the chest. Thought herbs might help her - the ones she cured the children's aches with. But Gran was no longer herself. She was a beast.
    453151|00000000||So? You give her the herbs?
    453028|00000000||Couldn't manage it - the Crones came back. I dropped to my knees and begged 'em to spare Gran. Brewess piped up first.
    453032|00000000||"Naughty boy, oh naughty. Shouldn't say 'no' when the sisters want to hear 'yes.'"
    453036|00000000||Then the Whispess says, "Run, boy, run, before your legs rot off." They all laughed - and I legged it.
    452977|00000000||What happened next?
   1057910|00000000||Went down there - the cellar under the house.
   1072024|00000000||And? What'd you find?
   1072026|00000000||Lots of cobwebs, strange objects, something like an altar on the wall…
   1057912|00000000||Oooh, that's enough for me. Needn't know anymore, nor do I want to.
   1057907|00000000||Been in the cellar.
    453016|00000000||Why'd the Weavess need Gran's hair? Any idea?
    453018|00000000||The Crones take folks' ears to hear all. Hair gives 'em power over folks' lives.
    453022|00000000||There are times they weave the hair into odd strings. Other times they take it downstairs.
    452981|00000000||Why'd the Weavess need Gran's hair?
    452979|00000000||What's beyond the door?
    453008|00000000||Take a look under the door?
    453010|00000000||I look like a fool to you?
    453012|00000000||No. You do look like the inquisitive type, though.
    453014|00000000||My inquisitiveness ends where folly begins.
    452967|00000000||By happenstance, Gran mixed some poppy seed and ash. Went by to help her sort it out. Mother nature gave me small hands, see, so I can do it easy like.
    452971|00000000||Workin' away we was, separatin' seeds from dust… Out of nowhere, Gran cried out! The mark on her hand started glowin'! She yelled at me to hide.
    452973|00000000||I crawled into a chest. Barely had time to blink before the Crones tottered in. The Weavess snipped a lock of Gran's hair. Called it punishment for lettin' the children escape. Then the hags opened the door in the floor. Went down, down, down - shame it weren't all the way to hell.
    452965|00000000||So you saw what happened to Gran?
    452888|00000000||Any idea what happened to Anna?
    452891|00000000||Crones wanna punish you? Why?
    452893|00000000||Get on the Crones' bad side?
    452933|00000000||I told 'em off, and they don't like it when you tell 'em off.
    452956|00000000||Why'd you do it?
    452958|00000000||Wanted to help Gran. She's always been good to the children. Would've been the doldrums out here without 'em, she'd 'ave died of boredom. Begged the Crones not to hurt Gran, but they were angry she'd let the children escape.
    448611|00000000||Johnny, wake up.
    448613|00000000||What? Who? Oh, witcher. You frightened me. Thought it were those vile hags.
    448615|00000000||Killed a few near your den.
    448617|00000000||The Crones sent them. To punish me.
   1004096|00000000||Your lands shall they trample and parcel with rope.
   1004097|00000000||Your cities razed shall be, their dwellers expelled.
   1004098|00000000||The bat, owl and raven your homes shall infest…
   1004099|00000000||…and the serpent will therein makes its nest.
   1014633|00000000||This don't seem like a just cause to me.
   1014643|00000000||Doesn't seem like a just cause to me.
   1014668|00000000||What if I told you my life depended on it?
   1014693|00000000||Split? What if I win the tournament?
   1014696|00000000||I shall have another proposition for you, then.
   1014699|00000000||What's the plan?
   1014717|00000000||I shall tell you all when the time is right. For now, just stay alert.
   1014718|00000000||And if you are eliminated, stay till the tournament's end. It'll be worth your while, you'll see.
   1014705|00000000||First, you must stay to the end of the tournament. I shall tell you the rest when the time comes.
   1014724|00000000||All sounds pretty mysterious, but… Fine.
   1014729|00000000||Excellent. Now that's settled, let's rejoin the others.
   1014672|00000000||Wouldn't believe you. Fringilla also mention I'm easy to manipulate?
   1014676|00000000||Ugh. She said you could be trusted. Very well, I'll have to manage on my own.
   1014669|00000000||Wouldn't believe you.
   1014670|00000000||Hm, that changes things.
   1014691|00000000||Hm, that changes things.
   1014656|00000000||Fine, let's say I help you.
   1014664|00000000||I'll split the coin with you, of course.
   1014632|00000000||Let's say I help you…
   1014616|00000000||Why tell me?
   1014619|00000000||I'm a woman. I'm in need of that coin. And Geralt of Rivia would never abandon a woman in need - or so I heard.
   1014621|00000000||Who'd you hear it from?
   1014624|00000000||Fringilla Vigo. She told me of your adventures in Beauclair. Apparently, you're dependable... so long as the cause is just.
   1014597|00000000||Why tell me this?
   1014558|00000000||Hm, not what I was expecting…
   1014588|00000000||Huh, as propositions go, this is not exactly what I was expecting. You don't seem like a--
   1014618|00000000||Thief? True, it's not my day job. Which is why I could use some help.
   1014531|00000000||Mmmm, alone at last.
   1010188|00000000||What did you want to talk about?
   1010189|00000000||A cartload of coin - that's the grand prize, you know. I can't speak for you, but I'd prefer it didn't land in the wrong hands.
   1014601|00000000||And luck can be so undependable. Frankly, one should simply take the coin, subtly, you know, without bothering the others.
    467748|00000000||… you fancy men like me - whole town's goin' on about it… So no point playin' hard to get, sugarpuss.
    467750|00000000||It's Lady var Attre to you. And I'd advise you to sod off, sugarpuss, before I report this to papa.
    525183|00000000||I wanna fight the Champion of Champions.
   1053114|00000000||What do they call ye?
    546681|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1075521|00000000||I'm ready to fight.
    546691|00000000||Geralt of Rivia - time to begin.
    525161|00000000||Wanna fight the champion.
    525174|00000000||This supposed to be a fistfight?
    525175|00000000||Aye, fists.
    525177|00000000||Err… 'course, we provide a dignified funeral, observin' the rituals o' the challenger's creed.
    525170|00000000||Behold, the Champion of Champions.
    525171|00000000||A rock troll. A very well-developed rock troll.
    525165|00000000||Anything I should know about my opponent? Had to fight a bear earlier. Bit surprised…
    546651|00000000||Go with him. He'll lead you where you need to go.
    525162|00000000||Reigning champion - tell me about him.
    525164|00000000||I'll be back. See you.
    525163|00000000||I'll be back.
    525178|00000000||Your champion's a troll.
    525179|00000000||Current champion's a troll. Everybody all right with that, no one's got a problem?
    525180|00000000||Why would they? He's an honorable troll. Came and said he wanted to fight and the previous champion agreed. That'd be Zama, known also as Sandylocks. And he got the name even 'fore the troll planted 'im in the dirt head first.
    525185|00000000||Troll have a name?
    525186|00000000||We wager he does, but he’ll not reveal it till he's defeated. He's a troll errant, see?
   1062539|00000000||Won't say much if he doesn't survive that fight.
   1062541|00000000||Aye, fair enough. But I wager he don't imagine he'll lose… And maybe, as he's a troll, he don't imagine much at all. Doubt logic's his strong suit.
    525159|00000000||Hey there.
    525160|00000000||Oh, the mutant, eh? Don't make a face. It's good y'are one. Ordinary bloke'd never stand a chance against the Champion of Champions. You have come to challenge him, haven't ye?
   1053116|00000000||Greetin's!
   1075384|00000000||Ye here to fight for the title o' champion?
   1075386|00000000||Mhm.
   1075388|00000000||I'm afeared you'll have to wait. Arena's closed on account of a certain, uh, incident. An incident to be examined, conclusions to be drawn, so it don't happen again.
   1075392|00000000||Fights're still suspended, Awful sorry.
   1075526|00000000||Nobody mentioned I'd be fighting a troll. Supposed to be a surprise?
    558741|00000000||This sacred ground is with blood stained. We cannot the ritual complete!
   1075572|00000000||People! Save yourselves! If your lives you value, run!
    569666|00000000||Good folk, we must the Eve complete! Prepare yourselves!
    558736|00000000||Ye we summon, ye we call. Enter, souls, we'll judge ye all.
    558737|00000000||All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
    558738|00000000||Something whispers, something peeps. Someone near our fire creeps.
    558739|00000000||All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
    558740|00000000||Wraiths!
    569669|00000000||If you wanna continue, I'm ready.
    569180|00000000||Continue.
    569181|00000000||What're you thinking?
    569183|00000000||The bloodshed - it do any harm?
    569184|00000000||Tainted lies the circle now. They who thirst for the gore of men shall come.
    569846|00000000||Gods willing, they will be few, and the pellar shall finish the rite.
    558734|00000000||Tis an ill turn, ill… Woe are we.
    562293|00000000||Blood has stained the hallowed ground.
    558735|00000000||Yet… we cannot stop what has begun.
    560573|00000000||This is hallowed ground!
    560571|00000000||Begone! Away with you!
    580504|00000000||Hey, cocker.
    580506|00000000||Slap a noonwraith's tits! You's a bigger ragpicker than me!
    577795|00000000||Need a trim. Think you can manage?
   1066771|00000000||Greetings to the honorable gentleman. Razors, scissors, knives, ground to sharpness mere moments ago.
   1066772|00000000||I want a haircut.
   1066773|00000000||Farewell.
    420961|a8d7dfc1||Witch Hunter
   1052369|00000000||Aren't you too young to be trading all on your own, sonny?
   1052371|00000000||I'm ninety-three years old, madam. So no, I'm not too young.
   1052373|00000000||Is that nice, lying to your elders? My eyes aren't what they once were, but I can see you're three feet tall and walk around barefoot!
   1052375|00000000||That's because I'm a halfling, madam. And I'd suggest eye drops, chamomile extract.
   1072814|00000000||Farewell.
   1072813|00000000||Show me your goods.
    454068|00000000||Footprints… Fresh.
    418911|00000000||Rich folk, doubt I'll ever understand 'em. Keepin' rats in cages - like rabbits.
    418913|00000000||Let 'em out, maybe…? Like to die of hunger if we leave 'em there.
    418915|00000000||I'd sooner burn the vermin. Releasing 'em's not like to bring no good.
    453421|00000000||Imagine the harm they'd do if they swam back to the village.
    418917|00000000||Swam? Rats? How d'ye figure they'd do that?
    444118|00000000||Ye needn't fret for 'em. Clever little bastards. Cleverer'n you.
    444120|00000000||Hm, they seem sluggish to you? Got the mange, maybe? Oargh! And that stench!
    376688|00000000||Dijkstra didn't mention anyone else… Must be one of Dandelion's crew.
   1075396|00000000||Vomit everywhere. Guess he had the antidote, too… couldn't keep it down anymore than the other guy.
    355211|00000000||Help! By the gods, save me!
    355221|00000000||Have mercy, please! Don't leave me here!
    355223|00000000||Well, well… Lit up like a bale of straw!
    405152|00000000||Fuckin' hell, that stinks!
    451635|00000000||Listen, old chap… This sword's made of silver! Know how much we'll get for it? Drink for a month!
    371072|00000000||Evil made flesh…
    583431|00000000||Crossbow bolt. A line tied to it. Line's clearly been cut.
    583433|00000000||Thief might've used it to lower the sack of coin. He'd need an accomplice waiting down below to grab it.
   1018157|00000000||Hm, something down there, but I can't make it out.
   1018092|00000000||Somebody dragged something heavy towards the terrace.
    583430|00000000||Blows delivered from a strange angle… expert though, precise.
    481162|00000000||Come on, Ciri! Don't you embarrass us!
   1038546|00000000||Mmmm-mmmmmm… Mmm!
   1038544|00000000||Mmmmmm!!
   1092032|00000000||Elihal
   1032744|00000000||Doublets after the latest fashion! Get them here and only here.
   1032746|00000000||They look Nilfgaardian.
   1032748|00000000||The fashion has come from the south.
   1032750|00000000||Soon everything will look Nilfgaardian… Know why? Because this will be a Nilfgaardian city.
   1052690|00000000||You should have known. Whosoever helps a sorceress breaks royal law.
   1052715|00000000||We only gave her water, a bit o' bread… She was hungry, tired. Were we to drive her off?
   1052717|00000000||No. You were to invite her in, let her lie in your bed… and then send for us.
   1052719|00000000||Have mercy! We'll know better from now on!
   1052721|00000000||Oh, yes. We'll make sure of that.
   1071959|00000000||[Play gwent.]
    581216|00000000||[Win.]
    581217|00000000||[Loss.]
    581213|00000000||Startin' at last! A year down the road I'll be plyin' Hortensia and my lads with tales of this night. Let's play!
   1054009|00000000||It's for your own good, son. Don't fight it.
   1054011|00000000||You're to cut off me thumb for me own good?! Ye gone daft?
   1054013|00000000||Radovid's army won't take ye. Man without a thumb can't hold a sword.
   1054015|00000000||Can't hold a scythe either! Or a sickle! Or a hammer! You'll make a cripple o' me!
   1054072|00000000||You're thicker than a troll! Why'd you go and poison Rowdy?!
   1054074|00000000||Quiet, damn wench.
   1054076|00000000||Stuffed 'im with nightshade and wolfsbane. Dragon'll fly in, swallow 'im…
   1054078|00000000||And pop its clogs.
   1054080|00000000||Fool, he were a dog, not a sheep! Dragons don't eat dogs!
   1032512|00000000||It's over. We've naught to talk about.
    501602|00000000||Piss off! None of your kind'll get in here on my watch!
    536458|00000000||Oh! Deepest apologies, guv'nor.
    536460|00000000||Fetch some mettle, you wretch.
    535452|00000000||I've been robbed! Thief!
   1039901|00000000||Seen anything strange around here?
   1039897|00000000||Seen anything strange around here? Anything alarming?
   1024216|00000000||I… I… I was in the house…
   1024222|00000000||That one?
   1024224|00000000||I believe so… Forgive me, I must rest…
   1039899|00000000||You all right?
   1039900|00000000||Are you all right?
   1039895|00000000||Where am I?
    582481|00000000||Ready?
    586294|00000000||Mhm.
    582482|00000000||Think I know how to get in. Got a plan.
    582483|00000000||If your plan doesn't include dealing with an escort of guardsmen, best revise it.
    582485|00000000||Calm, now. Let them start it.
    582486|00000000||You're expected. Come in.
    558273|00000000||Let's talk about Forefathers' Eve.
    558274|00000000||Mentioned Forefathers' Eve earlier.
    558275|00000000||The spirits' feast. You wish to see? You'll help the pellar?
    393199|00000000||The sooner we resolve this, the better. Best do it tonight, at midnight.
    558185|00000000||Seems like you could use a witcher - so, yeah, I'll help.
    558186|00000000||You'd not refuse, the pellar knew. The time's come to gather the folk.
    558192|00000000||Across the lake, we must journey - to Fyke Isle. There, in the circle of stones, we shall meet.
    558181|00000000||I'll help you.
   1037887|00000000||What'll I get out of it?
   1037889|00000000||Witchers do naught for free, this the pellar knows. Not to fear. How to reward one for their aid - this too the pellar knows.
   1037885|00000000||What'll you give me?
    558206|00000000||Can't help you just now.
    558207|00000000||But we alone cannot keep evil at bay! There's a war on. Men's blood soaks the earth. The damned o'er it wander in great numbers.
    558212|00000000||Ponder it. The pellar will pay ye. Should ye need him, the pellar in his hut ye'll find.
    558313|00000000||Said already I won't help. Gonna have to make do without me.
    561637|00000000||Not good, not good. No Forefathers' Eve this year, it means, the horror. Should your mind ye change, the pellar in his hut you'll find.
    558184|00000000||No time.
    567399|00000000||Forefathers' Eve - what's the point?
    567401|00000000||Why hold the ritual at all?
    567403|00000000||Atimes men die choking with regret, atimes death takes them afore they've tasted any bitterness in life. These poor souls, unfulfilled, cannot leave this vale of tears.
    567405|00000000||Their spirits wander 'midst the living… must be judged, sent on their way. This we do on Forefathers' Eve.
    558114|00000000||Ask a service of the witcher, the pellar must. A witcherly service, that's to say…
    561618|00000000||What do you need, tell me.
    561620|00000000||A man who fears no evil, the pellar needs…
    561622|00000000||Forefathers' Eve is nigh, we've rites to conduct. Wandering souls to emerge, damned souls, too. We've the circle to protect from these wretches.
   1053556|00000000||Have you heard? They've opened a cabaret at the old Rosemary and Thyme.
   1053558|00000000||A cabaret? What, the kind where they walk out on stage to tell questionable jests?
   1053560|00000000||No, the kind where ladies in feathers and fishnet stockings swing their legs about.
   1053562|00000000||Ooh, that I've got to see. Could do with a bit of culture.
    499421|cc43aede||Einar
   1068546|fa0b96aa||Edith
   1013306|00000000||Piss off, human.
   1013304|00000000||Shove off.
   1013310|00000000||Raise your axes!
   1013308|00000000||Death liberates!
   1013302|00000000||Leave it, lad.
   1013300|00000000||Well, I'll be...
    337201|00000000||Didn't have to end this way…
    435379|00000000||We know each other?
    467697|00000000||Not personal, like, though I've seen ye many times.
    467703|00000000||I've a gift. I see the future. Yours as well…
    467711|00000000||But not for free, I guess…
    467713|00000000||I don't ask much. If you've a bite to eat…
    435444|00000000||Lemme get you something.
    435372|00000000||Bring you something to eat.
    507464|00000000||Got what you asked for.
    507466|00000000||Thank ye, now I need a moment.
    507469|00000000||I see a wolf, strivin' forward towards a solitary tower, 'midst a blizzard.
    507471|00000000||He follows the swallow. Yet the swallow does not heed the wolf's howls, soarin' higher and higher, for it knows 'tis its last flight…
    507477|00000000||Ess'tuath esse! So shall it be! Look for the signs! The world will perish amidst ice and be reborn with the new sun!
    507479|00000000||Reborn of the Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of a planted seed…
    507481|00000000||Ithlinne's prophecy.
    507487|00000000||Leave me be. Go. Go now.
    507461|00000000||Here's what you asked for.
    435741|00000000||I see a white wolf. He looks on as the Great Viper bites and devours the Silver Lily. He wants to spring, he wants to fight, but the serpent is quicker. The lily must perish.
    454172|00000000||Fine. I'll see what I can do.
   1037818|00000000||See what I can do.
   1037838|00000000||Not that interested in seeing if it still does.
   1037840|00000000||Yet without dragonsroot I cannot hope to foresee your future…
   1037841|00000000||Think I'll survive. Farewell.
   1037817|00000000||Not gonna run around picking magic roots.
    467746|00000000||That's not the future. Lived through that - and you probably heard about it in some ballad.
    454170|00000000||My third eye grows foggier the older I become… but if you brought me some dragonsroot…
   1037776|00000000||Rare plant.
   1037778|00000000||Rare, indeed, but it did once grow in a cave southeast of here.
    435749|00000000||I see a white wolf, he enters an endless cavern. He sings a hymn of madness and despair, summoning that which is not dead, for it cannot die.
    467721|00000000||Here.
    467736|00000000||Thank ye. A fine offerin', well worth a foretellin'.
    467738|00000000||Ahh, all right, let's hear it.
    435374|00000000||Got some food.
    435446|00000000||Sorry, I don't have time for this.
    467768|00000000||May ye not want for time when it is truly needed…
    435376|00000000||Farewell.
   1065909|00000000||Your gift - tell me about it.
   1065911|00000000||Been having these visions long?
   1065913|00000000||Since I were a tyke. Me mother took me to the village witch once. I fells into her cauldron full of some magic brew.
   1065915|00000000||Mhm. Seriously?
   1065917|00000000||If I'm to tell it serious, 'twere as a youth that I got hit in the back of me head with a rock. Started seein' more'n others.
    467715|00000000||Oh, you're back.
    369930|00000000||Come on. Get ready. Your turn now.
    369932|00000000||I am ready. Uh, losers get paid anythin'?
    369940|00000000||Heh. Losers get carted off to the cemetery.
    379696|00000000||Want me to follow you?
    379698|00000000||{energetically nods}
    379700|00000000||No choice, I guess.
    381973|00000000||{doesn't have a choice}
    379692|00000000||Want me to follow you?
    379694|00000000||I don't understand, try to explain.
    379702|00000000||Can't understand you. Try to explain it somehow…?
    381975|00000000||{Johnny puts his thumb on his forehead}
    379704|00000000||{Indicates for Geralt to follow him}
    379684|00000000||What's wrong, can't talk?
    379686|00000000||{nods energetically}
    379688|00000000||Why?
    415140|00000000||{makes some firm motion showing his impatience}
    415142|00000000||Lost your voice?
    381985|00000000||{nods energetically}
    381987|00000000||Can I help you somehow?
    379690|00000000||{nods and signals Geralt to follow him}
    379678|00000000||You can't talk.
    379706|00000000||You know the kids from the clearing well?
    379708|00000000||{suspicious look at Geralt}
    420489|00000000||Don't be afraid. Not gonna hurt anyone.
    379680|00000000||You know the kids from the clearing well?
    379682|00000000||You gotta know what goes on around here.
    379710|00000000||This where you live?
    379712|00000000||{nods, is proud}
    417713|00000000||Cozy burrow, good location. Must know about everything that happens in the bog.
    417715|00000000||{tilts his head}
    417717|00000000||Doesn't bother you, having monsters for neighbors?
    417719|00000000||{points to himself, and then shows how scary he is and how he scares off monsters}
    379656|00000000||Johnny?
    381981|00000000||Don't be afraid.
    379660|00000000||You're a bucca...?
    420491|00000000||{shakes his head}
    420493|00000000||A lutin...?
    420495|00000000||{shakes his head}
    420497|00000000||Ah, a godling. Not many of you left.
    415132|00000000||{nods}
    415134|00000000||I'm looking for a woman with ashen hair. Seen her?
    379668|00000000||{nods yes}
    379670|00000000||Tell me everything, from the start. Where did you see her, what was she doing? It's important to me.
    415136|00000000||{shakes his head}
    415138|00000000||Why not?
    379672|00000000||{gestures to indicate he can't talk}
   1044054|00000000||"Joachim de Wett's skull." Hm, pretty grim "curiosity."
    466414|00000000||Walk you home?
    466416|00000000||Hey now! I'm grateful, sure, but I'll not demonstrate that in the alcove!
    467758|00000000||Walk you home. That's it.
    467760|00000000||Hmm… In that case, yes… Come.
    466410|00000000||Lemme walk you home.
    466418|00000000||All right. Be careful, now. Won't always be someone there to protect you…
    467762|00000000||I know. I didn't come to Novigrad on yesterday's hay cart.
    466412|00000000||Farewell.
    467774|00000000||You could've managed it?
    467776|00000000||You'd 'ave managed it? Managed those men? By yourself?
    467778|00000000||Of course! Knee to the bollocks, elbow to the throat, job done!
    466406|00000000||You all right?
    467772|00000000||Fine. Truth be told I'd 'ave managed it on my own… But thank you.
    555063|00000000||Geralt, I shall help you--
    555065|00000000||Step back.
   1061188|00000000||Stop telling me what to do!
    592402|00000000||You are stubborn, dh'oine.
    403006|00000000||You want to race? I'd not let you groom my horse.
   1016832|00000000||Up your arse.
    480722|00000000||Oi, man, this is Novigrad - no monsters to be 'ad!
    481139|00000000||Hit him!
    506591|00000000||We shall talk about this later, all right?
    489118|00000000||Such are the times, my good fellow.
    440044|00000000||Quickly. Before someone comes in.
    486529|00000000||I'm not a witcher.
    486532|00000000||I'm not a witcher. Just grew up there.
    486565|00000000||I believe it, seein' how you swing that sword.
    486500|00000000||On the road.
    486701|00000000||Mh. A little here, a little there…
    486702|00000000||Not surprising given you wander the world alone.
    486712|00000000||Not alone no more! She's in the company now!
    486710|00000000||That's right! You're a member of the company! We're drinkin' together, killed a wild boar as a pack, you might say, but we've no notion how you arrived here.
    486717|00000000||A woman in a man's garb, razor on her back… Who exactly are you? You a mercenary?
    486728|00000000||Just a traveler.
    486943|00000000||I just travel a lot. And I don't always happen upon such good and civil company.
    486946|00000000||Aaaah, gift of the gab, she's got! Here's to good company!
    486948|00000000||This I like! Drinks like a lad, knows her sword work, kills a boar as if it were a piglet! A she-wolf, if ever I've seen one!
    486661|00000000||What's the problem?
    486665|00000000||Well that's an awfully gloomy face.
    486676|00000000||Too much of a coward to race a woman?!
    480558|00000000||The horse is mine.
    486686|00000000||To race the baron himself - I'd consider it an honor.
    486689|00000000||Oh-oh! That'd be a sight to behold!
    486691|00000000||Would it ever!
    480559|00000000||Done. But if I win, I take your sword.
    480560|00000000||Agreed.
    480561|00000000||I'd not drink anymore this night. You'll want your head about you. We start at daybreak.
    486648|00000000||What happened? You get the jitters?
    486679|00000000||No.
    486680|00000000||Hahaha. So why not?
    486646|00000000||Coward?
    486627|00000000||Perhaps you'd care to wager?
    486628|00000000||Think you can outrun me on an 'orse? Hahahah, naturally! What's the stake?
    486630|00000000||Black mare. The one in the stable.
   1058172|00000000||Oh, that won't do at all…
    486930|00000000||A woman could swing a sword - I've knowed one. But never seen a lady mount anythin' but a cock proper. All tipsy on 'orseback. Nothin' strange on account they bloody mount them sideways.
    486942|00000000||All right, all right.
    486736|00000000||Let's say I go about my business, and when there's coin to be earned, I don't readily turn it down.
    486940|00000000||I've always 'eld - with the world 'ow it is today, lasses ought to know 'ow to fend for theirselves.
    486726|00000000||Something of the sort.
    486727|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    486746|00000000||Mm, a witcher - though, not entirely. I never went through the mutations.
    486751|00000000||A witcher? So, apart from the swordplay, what, you know potions and all that?
    486923|00000000||Not so much. A bit.
    486925|00000000||Cause you see, atimes I get this pinchin' back here…
    486927|00000000||Shut it, Ygrin. Nobody cares about your backside!
    486752|00000000||Know any of them potions?
    486531|00000000||They made an exception for me.
    486535|00000000||Right. Mean to say you're a she-witcher?
    486564|00000000||Not entirely. The mutations - I was never subjected to them. But everything else I know, I learned from the witchers there.
    486528|00000000||I'm the exception.
    486524|00000000||At Kaer Morhen.
    486527|00000000||Witchers' school there, aye. But they only took lads, as I recall.
    486499|00000000||At Kaer Morhen.
    480554|00000000||Ciri! Come! Whole haunch should be yours, as I see it!
    480555|00000000||Aye, you done well, lass.
    480556|00000000||Not bad, not bad at all, but who goes boar huntin' with a sword?
    511008|00000000||No bow at hand, no spear. My sword was all I had.
    486498|00000000||Heheheh. Well, you brandished it beautifully. Where'd they teach you that, anyway?
    486477|00000000||That lass of yours - pure luck in the flesh. To hunt down a wild boar that size - why, worthy of one of King Foltest's feasts, were he still among the living.
   1085156|c342edbc||Agneta
    501477|00000000||By the Eternal Fire… I've never seen so many before.
    501478|00000000||Looks unsavory. What is all this?
    501479|00000000||The trappings of a black magic ritual. Witches weave human hair through dolls they first curse. They gain a grasp on individuals' souls this way.
    501484|00000000||Think one of the dolls represents Anna? Can we free her if we find it?
    501485|00000000||It's the only way I know of, but there are risks involved. The items woven into the dolls - see them?
    501763|00000000||They symbolize the individuals the dolls are meant to represent. We must find the doll that is Anna and take it from here.
    501770|00000000||How do you know all this?
    501778|00000000||Seem to know a lot about this.
    501781|00000000||From tomes on black magic. Initially, we burned any that we found. Recently we decided it might be wise to read them first.
    501784|00000000||Poisoning your minds with magic, heh, superstition? What's the hierarch think of that?
    501786|00000000||Have you met the man?
    501788|00000000||No.
    501790|00000000||Neither have I.
    501769|00000000||Mentioned a risk…
    501772|00000000||This risk you mentioned - take it we only get one shot at choosing the right doll?
    501774|00000000||I'll not chance it. I did not know Anna… You've learned much of her. Should find it easier to choose.
    501776|00000000||All right. Let's take a look at these dolls.
   1072228|00000000||Doll with the human ear.
    453320|00000000||Human ear attached to this one.
   1072370|00000000||Belonged to one of the peasants, doubtless. Anna still has both her ears.
   1072372|00000000||Let's look at the others.
   1072224|00000000||Doll with the red bead.
    453314|00000000||Hm, red bead attached to this one. Anna wears a string of those around her neck.
   1072243|00000000||As do half the women from Novigrad to Vengerberg. This cannot be the one.
    448806|00000000||Hm, all right. I'll look at the others.
    448800|00000000||Other dolls are worth a look.
    448798|00000000||You're wrong. I'm taking this doll.
    448818|00000000||And I think it is. I'm taking this doll.
    448896|00000000||It's Anna!
   1072535|00000000||What have you done?!
    448812|00000000||Could be true… Fine, I'm taking this one. Sure as hell hope you're right.
   1072337|00000000||As do I.
    448790|00000000||You might be right. I'm taking this doll.
    448792|00000000||Should look at the others.
   1072349|00000000||Doubtful. Crones'd have no reason to employ trickery here.
   1072227|00000000||Doll with the violet hollyhock bloom.
    453310|00000000||Hm… this is interesting.
   1072351|00000000||A doll with a flower? What's so interesting in that?
   1072353|00000000||Not just any flower - a violet hollyhock. Baron once told me it was Anna's favorite flower.
   1072355|00000000||Hm. You believe this to be the doll?
    448816|00000000||I'm sure it is. Taking it.
    448898|00000000||Quick! Outside!
    448794|00000000||Yeah. I'm taking it.
    448796|00000000||I should look at the others.
   1072357|00000000||Might very well be, but I can't be sure.
   1072335|00000000||Should look at the others.
   1072226|00000000||Doll with the bird feathers.
    453306|00000000||Hm, bird feathers woven into this one… If I had to bet on it, I'd say this doll represented Philippa.
   1072339|00000000||Philippa Eilhart? If that's true, then--
   1072341|00000000||Relax, first name that came to mind, that's all. Philippa's way too clever for the Crones to have snared her in some trap.
   1072343|00000000||Besides, we're not here for Philippa, we're here to save Anna. And I can't think of any link between her and bird feathers.
   1072347|00000000||That might seem obvious… but what if it's a ruse, and this doll, in fact, symbolizes Anna?
   1009324|00000000||No...!
   1009318|00000000||It's you.
   1009312|00000000||Greetings.
   1009310|00000000||Simpleton.
    571686|00000000||Whoa! Greetings!
    571688|00000000||Good grief, me foot-wrappin's reek!
    571690|00000000||Beaver bugger me…
    594953|00000000||I serve the Eternal Fire.
   1031500|00000000||You cut down the butcher. Would you consider culling Cleaver, Reuven and the rest of the vermin?
    594955|00000000||Disperse, go home.
    594957|00000000||All's in order.
    594959|00000000||Guards! Guards, over here!
    594961|00000000||I want him alive!
   1019257|00000000||Put down your weapon and back away.
   1072758|00000000||That's a good boy.
   1072760|00000000||Oi! What the hell?!
   1072762|00000000||Hargh, argh. You'll rot in the dungeon!
    467317|00000000||Won't get past me!
   1044066|00000000||"Assire var Anahid's Necklace." Wonder if it's the real thing.
   1016596|00000000||I thank you. This means so much…
    551763|00000000||No. Could be someone stole it.
    551764|00000000||Perhaps… So many years have passed… But go back and search carefully. I've naught else to offer you.
   1011196|00000000||I'll do that.
   1011200|00000000||Time I was on my way.
   1011201|00000000||Gods guide you.
    551765|00000000||Yeah. Pretty generous as rewards go.
    551766|00000000||You've earned every last bit.
   1016135|00000000||And… perchance did you find my chest… with my treasures?
   1016130|00000000||It's safe now.
   1011213|00000000||It's safe now.
   1011215|00000000||So long.
   1011214|00000000||Farewell.
   1016591|00000000||Nothing just yet, gran. Be back soon… with something.
    551760|00000000||You've returned. What's become of my home?
    434482|00000000||Nothin' to do, eh? Well, I've plenty, so sod off.
    586829|00000000||Yup, you'll make a fortune…
    586839|00000000||Right… Best bit's when the guard draped you over his saddle like a sack of corn.
    586841|00000000||Stands to make you a fortune.
    586882|00000000||Time will tell.
    586883|00000000||You're getting to be grumpy in your old age.
    586828|00000000||That's your interest in this? What about Ciri?
    586831|00000000||That all you care about - the ballads this'll inspire?
    586833|00000000||Ego swell a bit lately? Getting more and more selfish with age.
    586835|00000000||What is that about?
    586837|00000000||It's about Ciri!
    586880|00000000||Why would I ever worry about her?
    462514|00000000||No, a certain deformed midget who appeared out of the blue on the shores of Hindarsfjall…
    462516|00000000||And now wanders around the baron's castle…
    420208|00000000||Guess I should head back to Velen...
    420204|00000000||Doubt it. Talked to the baron there - he's the one helped Ciri. Said she rode off to Novigrad to look for Yen and me.
    587731|00000000||And Yen's in Skellige, looking into traces she thinks Ciri left behind there.
    587687|00000000||So? Skellige?
    587732|00000000||Skellige.
    587710|00000000||Maybe… I'll need to check. Also gotta see if Yen's learned anything in Skellige.
   1071556|00000000||You two have chattered enough. Now it's my turn to talk to Dandelion.
   1071558|00000000||And I'll gladly have a go at him when you're done. Let's get back to the Rosemary and Thyme.
    487181|00000000||Weeell, I've certainly had my share of excitement for one day. A juicy roast and a soft bed with fluffy pillows - I think that's the least I'm owed…
    587811|00000000||We haven't seen each other, talked, in ages. Consider dropping by if you're in the area.
   1062882|00000000||I'm sure to be by sometime soon.
   1062884|00000000||I'll hold you to that, Geralt. See you soon. And thanks again for today.
    420206|00000000||Maybe… Besides, the curse might've had something to do with Uma. I should collect him from the baron.
    587805|00000000||Uma - the, uh, deformed midget? What will you do with him?
    587807|00000000||First, lift the curse. Maybe I can get some help at Kaer Morhen.
    587809|00000000||After that - who knows.
    416867|00000000||She's slipped away, again… I was so close.
    487179|00000000||Hmm… She came here from Velen. Somebody there helped her, apparently. Maybe she went back?
    587519|00000000||I need to find Ciri.
    587576|00000000||Dammit, that's just not enough. Ciri say anything else?
    587574|00000000||Ciri say anything else?
    587569|00000000||Ciri ever mention him?
    587617|00000000||Ciri ever mention him?
    587638|00000000||Some deformed midget? No.
    587580|00000000||Didn't say much at all, to be honest.
    587599|00000000||Geralt, she's no longer that little girl who ran around Kaer Morhen.
    587600|00000000||Sure, she's still impulsive, alive, but she's also stubborn and sulky... Apple didn't fall far from the tree, lemme tell you.
    587606|00000000||Right…
    462545|00000000||Doesn't mean a thing to me.
    587550|00000000||Even less to me.
    462543|00000000||Argh, you and Ciri - like two water droplets. Never know what either of you are talking about.
    462522|00000000||Hm, the curse invokes ugliness… My entire life, don't think I've seen anyone uglier than--
    587557|00000000||Stunning Gemma?
    587411|00000000||Know any more about the curse? Something specific, a detail? Anything?
    587413|00000000||Hmm... Well, I know the words.
    587415|00000000||You're kidding.
    587417|00000000||No. They were elven. Ciri was constantly repeating them to herself, probably not to forget.
    487144|00000000||Went like this: "Va fail, elaine, ceàdmil folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus."
    487139|00000000||Know any more about the curse?
    487140|00000000||Why was Ciri interested in a curse?
    487634|00000000||What was Ciri's interest in this curse? Did she want to cast it or lift it? She tell you?
    587367|00000000||She wasn't all that willing to talk about it. I didn't want to pry.
    587369|00000000||The one time when it might've been useful.
    587371|00000000||But I'm almost positive she meant to lift it.
    587373|00000000||Off who, what? Or was it about her directly?
    587374|00000000||No... I don't think so… I mean, she didn't look cursed.
    587375|00000000||But boy was she in a hurry.
    487115|00000000||Ciri ever tell you what this is? And Whoreson - why'd she go to him with it?
    587342|00000000||She went to Whoreson because I took her there.
    587344|00000000||Coulda guessed that was your idea.
    587346|00000000||What? Her magic bauble was broken - Whoreson had access to the mages who could fix it.
    587348|00000000||Besides, she needed help deciphering a curse… its incantation.
    487112|00000000||Any idea what the phylactery's for?
    587483|00000000||Gotta problem? Solve it yourself.
    587489|00000000||You've made your bed - lie in it.
    587484|00000000||No, but I'll be sure to next time.
    587491|00000000||No, but I'll make sure to mention it next time.
    587492|00000000||Thanks! Adventures are great, but they can hard to write up if you're fingerless. Which is not to say Whoreson would stop at that.
    487302|00000000||What about Sigi Reuven… how's he doing?
    587487|00000000||Fine, last I heard.
    487361|00000000||That's too bad. 'Cause I have a sneaking suspicion he might be a teeny bit mad at me…
    587466|00000000||You don't care a lick about your friends.
    587464|00000000||Ran outta time.
    587482|00000000||Didn't have time.
    487298|00000000||Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled.
    487300|00000000||Hey, while you were at it, you didn't think to put in a good word for me, did you?
    587462|00000000||Something like, I never intended to cheat him and if he harms a hair on my head he'll have you to deal with?
    587337|00000000||True, Whoreson wasn't thrilled.
    487113|00000000||Whoreson's dead.
    487333|00000000||Whoreson's dead.
    587430|00000000||Oo, guess you're no stranger to fury, either.
    587432|00000000||Weeeell, can't say I regret the man's abrupt passing. Deserved it as much as he deserved that… awkward nickname.
    487335|00000000||What about our old friend Sigi Reuven? Been to see him yet?
    487337|00000000||He's fine.
    487338|00000000||That's too bad. 'Cause there's a good chance he's furious with me…
    587336|00000000||You get it from Whoreson?! Whoa, Ciri'll be overjoyed. Whoreson on the other hand's gotta be pre-tty furious!
    586843|00000000||You have any idea how she fights?! The girl can take care of herself, believe me.
    586847|00000000||Anyway, she's gotta come back for that little box. The trinket that started it all.
    587334|00000000||Mean this?
    586857|00000000||I'm just… worried.
    586885|00000000||About who? Ciri? Have a little faith, Geralt.
    586830|00000000||Nobody's gonna read that drivel.
    586856|00000000||Sheesh, what crawled into your britches and bit you?
    586827|00000000||Nobody's gonna read that.
    586808|00000000||Ah, what an adventure! One minute we were pulling off the heist of the century, the next we were prey, a pack of hunters on our tail…
   1071537|00000000||Yes, a splendid story, but I think I've had my fill of this boasting. Come, Zoltan, we must convince the halflings they saw nothing at all.
    586809|00000000||Gave me enough material for a volume of ballads! And this one'll sell like hotcakes!
    420210|00000000||It would also explain her spectacular appearance there a second time around… But she's not in the isles anymore, I'm sure of that.
   1045361|00000000||No good. No evil. Only pain.
   1045363|00000000||This is not the end…
   1045365|00000000||Seems you are bleeding.
    476772|00000000||Didn't come here to chat.
    476780|00000000||I'm…
    476782|00000000||I know who you are. Believe I also know why you've come.
    476786|00000000||We'll talk inside.
    476778|00000000||Rumors rarely find confirmation in reality - especially the ones about foreigners.
    476788|00000000||Heheh. Right you are.
    476770|00000000||It's just that - blabber.
    473141|00000000||Look at that - didn't even stay for tea.
    476766|00000000||In spite of all that blabberin' about how cultured the nation is…
    473270|00000000||Ah-ha, our defender of the downtrodden. Greetings.
    473274|00000000||News gets around quick.
    476790|00000000||That it does.
    476792|00000000||When I learned you'd slaughtered my men, I thought to have you captured and hanged. Or at least flogged.
    476796|00000000||But then I thought - one tough cocker if he bested that lot of cutthroats. Man like him could prove useful…
    476814|00000000||Useful? How?
    476830|00000000||That's the spirit! We'll work well together - I can see that already.
    476832|00000000||This way.
    476798|00000000||Useful for what?
    476794|00000000||I'm no thug for hire.
    476800|00000000||I'm not a thug for hire.
    476802|00000000||I know who you are.
    476804|00000000||But since you come here having perpetrated that bloodbath, I assume you've something important to discuss.
    476806|00000000||I do.
    476808|00000000||Very well, then let's discuss it.
    473276|00000000||One thing - you'd do well to behave this time. Remember, I've still to decide what to do with you.
    473278|00000000||Which I shall do after we've spoken.
    427052|00000000||And do you know what she's wearing?
    427054|00000000||No, what?
    427097|00000000||Stitch for stitch the same dress my cousin's wife wore a year ago.
   1000331|00000000||It's identical! Just longer, of another color and it has no lace.
   1000533|00000000||Can you imagine? He failed to recognize her in that mask!
   1000535|00000000||His own wife? Seems rather unlikely…
   1000537|00000000||Teehehe! Well, he was quite drunk at the time.
    427056|00000000||Does no one truly know who she is?
   1000333|00000000||She behaves like a princess of the blood, but in my view…
    427058|00000000||Well, you can see for yourself. At the ball's end all shall remove their masks.
    427060|00000000||Phwar! See the one in the tight tunic? The one who arrived with the red-headed bitch?
    427062|00000000||Well, well. You called Vegelbud an old stick-in-the-mud, yet here she's hired a male stripper!
    427119|00000000||But why did he come with a woman?
    427121|00000000||Perhaps she hands him his props.
    371076|00000000||He's the one slaughtered the baron's men.
   1065774|00000000||You must tell me whatever you learn, immediately. Do you hear?
   1067759|00000000||Even should the truth be painful. I want no lies… I wish to know.
   1066577|00000000||I thank you - I thank you how only a mother seeking her child can thank you.
    521704|00000000||Heard you're a good boatwright and an even better card player.
    521707|00000000||Ye wanna play?
    521712|00000000||Always ready for a round.
    521681|00000000||Let's play.
    521713|00000000||I'll be back - need to look through my deck.
    521682|00000000||Not now.
    521710|00000000||Up for a round of cards?
    521711|00000000||Why not. Let's play.
    521694|00000000||Heard you play gwent.
    521918|00000000||Rules say the card's mine.
   1076412|00000000||Aye, 'tis indeed. Gods, believe you're good enough to try your luck 'gainst Haddy. Folk laugh at 'im 'cause he's young and a bit dim, but word is he weren't afraid to beat the baron hisself.
    521916|00000000||Ye lost, but ye needn't get your breeches in a bunch. Round here they say bad luck at cards means good luck at love. Proven true in my case - wench I live with's not fit for nothin'.
    521920|00000000||Seein' as you've robbed me of me best card, you're sure to wanna hear about two other unique cards. Had me eye on both once.
    531354|00000000||Went clear to Novigrad for one of them - though true, 'twas before the war. Saw a certain Marquise Serenity. I've only heard folk tell of the second. Gremist, a venerable druid of Skellige, holds it.
   1064176|00000000||Rainboot… Yelloooo colo. Perty.
   1064174|00000000||Man shoeses shininess…
   1064178|00000000||Troll cave must be nearby.
   1064180|00000000||That do you why?!
   1066591|00000000||Shoeses pick Rogg, calmy kind, no ohn hurt!
   1066593|00000000||Rogg crushmust now yous!
   1011801|00000000||Piss off, vagrant. Nothing for you here.
   1011803|00000000||Leave now. Or I'll kill you.
   1011805|00000000||Enough. Get him!
    419435|00000000||I'll find her. And come back for you.
    419443|00000000||She escaped you, but I'll find her. We'll come back here together and kill you.
    419445|00000000||You'll return, you shall. Our fates are bound.
    419447|00000000||And one will die. But it shan't be one of us.
    419453|00000000||And if you find her - if - the girl will die… hmheh.
    531810|00000000||Be seeing you…
    531812|00000000||Handsome knight.
    531814|00000000||Heeheeheeheeheehee!
    531816|00000000||Heeheeheeheeheehee!
    531818|00000000||See you very soon.
    531820|00000000||Heeheeheeheeheehee!
    419449|00000000||Now you shall chase shadows and wander midst fog.
    419451|00000000||Each time you see her, she will be a mirage.
    419437|00000000||You tried to kill her. Can't forgive you for that.
    419439|00000000||Waste of words.
    419441|00000000||Our fates are bound, true. But now is not the time for that to bear fruit…
    419433|00000000||I won't let you get away with it.
    416503|00000000||You tried to kill her.
    419425|00000000||Tried to butcher her like an animal and eat her.
    419427|00000000||Her blood, the taste brought back memories of our youth.
    419429|00000000||Elder Blood. Extraordinary girl. But you know that.
    419431|00000000||Such a shame she fled.
    580438|00000000||Ahh, give it a rest.
    580440|00000000||No bread, no coin. Poor as shite.
    416584|00000000||If Johnny's real, he must leave prints.
    561426|00000000||Here about the contract. Any idea what this monster is?
    561427|00000000||Nay, but proper huge it must be. Slaughtered no less than a dozen wolves. Ripped their guts out, but left lots uneaten.
    593630|00000000||Means malice rules it, makes it kill. Howls and bellows nights somethin' fierce. Folk're afeard to venture into the woods, though hunger grips the village.
   1067477|00000000||My reward - let's talk.
   1071484|00000000||Could tend to the beast for you… but not for free.
   1072940|00000000||How much d'ye need?
   1067481|00000000||Huh? Where're we to get a sum like that? Ye been here long? Don't seem it. Have ye seen how folk live?
   1067483|00000000||It's a lot… But truth be told, job like that… Drop your ask a couple o' crowns and we'll be set.
   1067485|00000000||That's a sum we can agree to.
   1067487|00000000||Wha, ye barmy? Whuh. I do beg your pardon, but… well, that's not decent! Tell ye how much we've collected. Ye can take it or be on your way.
    445139|00000000||Farewell.
    445630|00000000||Take care now.
   1067478|00000000||Farewell.
   1067418|00000000||I'll tend to it.
    561428|00000000||Fine. I'll take care of it.
    561429|00000000||Fortune smiled upon us when it brought you here. Good huntin' to ye!
    561431|00000000||A chort was prowling the nearby forest. Found itself competing for territory with a fiend, so it turned aggressive.
    561432|00000000||A chort, a fiend - why they be botherin' us? Think more'll come? Think they've done made a pact to take our village?
    561433|00000000||Doubt it. But I'll be sure to keep my eyes open, see if there's anything else out there.
    561438|00000000||Cheers then, witcher! Here, take the purse. All the folk of the village chipped in.
   1019581|00000000||Thanks. Take care now.
    445137|00000000||Here about the contract.
    445133|00000000||Ooh, aye?
   1037268|00000000||Happen to like zander.
   1038616|00000000||Happen to like zander.
   1039283|00000000||Cause you're a witcher! What you shove in them potions, shit's a delicacy to youse! Heheheh!
   1039303|00000000||A witcher? Never mentioned he was a witcher…
   1039211|00000000||"Recenterly" is not a word.
   1039243|00000000||"Recenterly" isn't a word.
   1039271|00000000||Who'd you bring along, Chivay? Shome ploughin' grammar purisht?
   1037271|00000000||Bombs.
   1039590|00000000||Bombs.
   1039592|00000000||How's that?
   1039595|00000000||Heheheh, Bilzen, heard many jests lately? Though, true enough, that one wasnae very funny.
   1037272|00000000||Excuse me for a minute.
   1037269|00000000||Excuse me for a minute.
   1039305|00000000||Excuse me for a minute.
   1039332|00000000||Hahah. Humans - couldn't hold their Mahakaman spirit if their life depended on it.
   1039334|00000000||Heh! Go on! And if you need help holdin' your hair back, give us a holler! Hahahahaha…
   1037285|00000000||Right.
   1039548|00000000||Right. Can see the bottom of this one.
   1037286|00000000||In a bit.
   1039546|00000000||Now! You forgotten why we've come? How're we gonna get pished on one bottle?
   1039550|00000000||Fine, going.
   1037284|00000000||In a bit.
   1037283|00000000||Geralt, go fetch us another bottle.
   1039594|00000000||Live bait.
   1039598|00000000||You see, Chivay? He'll make a good angler yet. In some fifty, sixty years.
   1039603|00000000||Heheheh. We'll wait and see.
   1037270|00000000||Live bait.
   1039347|00000000||Bilzen, did ye hear Vibbo Batilda last cast a pea and caught a young pike?
   1039364|00000000||Aaa, cocksucker's lyin' like always! Pontar pike aren't so dimwitted to go after his rottin' peas. Ye need live bait.
   1039384|00000000||Or night crawlers, though the pike aren't as eager. Don't know why… Once dug up a crawlie so fat and lovely, I started droolin', woulda eaten it myself!
   1039588|00000000||Uh, I'm not so sure. Geralt, what do you and your pals use up at Kaer Morhen?
   1039234|00000000||Like shit.
   1039337|00000000||All right. Grab your rods, we're off to the Pontar. Can't let this drivel stand, not in me own home…
   1037267|00000000||Like shit.
   1038570|00000000||So what that zanders're eager biters, if they taste like shite in soapy water?
   1037265|00000000||That's 'cause you're about as good a cook as a goat's arse is a clarinet. Just recenterly I took some fresh thyme--
   1038610|00000000||Haha, and it tasted like thyme-flavored shite! Hahahaa…
   1039225|00000000||Shut it! So, recenterly I-I took this thyme--
   1039227|00000000||Geralt? Care to chime in? How's zander taste to you?
   1068613|00000000||Follow me.
   1054652|00000000||Down the corridor, then left.
   1052485|00000000||Cyprian Wiley's disappeared.
   1052487|00000000||They kill him, or he done a runner?
   1052489|00000000||You ask me, he's in hidin'.
   1052491|00000000||Crossed those he shouldn't have, and they'll get him, mark my words. Just a matter of time.
   1052493|00000000||I think he knows exactly what he's doin'. Clever sod, that one.
    474105|00000000||Hm, guess I got it right.
    473914|00000000||Hmm… Candle holder's loose. Wonder if I can turn it.
    473918|00000000||Turn right.
    474086|00000000||Hmm… interesting.
    474052|00000000||Turn left.
    474054|00000000||Turn right.
    474048|00000000||Turn left.
    474050|00000000||Turn right.
    474040|00000000||Turn right.
    474038|00000000||Turn left.
    474115|00000000||No. Did something wrong. Gotta start again.
    473920|00000000||Step back.
    473916|00000000||Turn left.
   1062004|00000000||Left his valuables out as a decoy, to draw attention… Question is, away from what?
   1061988|00000000||Left his ledgers out. No merchant worth his salt does that.
   1062130|00000000||Looks like folk were here moments ago. Whatever happened to the villagers, happened awful quick.
   1062028|00000000||Village wasn't plundered, hut wasn't looted. These weren't raiders or thieves.
   1062026|00000000||Traces of ice around the footprints. Really?
   1062008|00000000||Lotta inkwells… different tone ink in each. Best guess? Expert forger - seals, letters, documents.
   1061986|00000000||Air's strange… Like dropping into a deep cellar on a hot day… And the mist…
   1061998|00000000||Valuables left unlocked - on display, almost. Lost his mind or…? Hm…
    473586|00000000||Face scorched, hard to identify.
    473912|00000000||There's a draft… Gotta be a space under this rubble.
    474365|00000000||Guess I should do some cleaning.
   1054311|00000000||Never seen anyone swing a sword as quick as you do…
    398838|00000000||Mercy! I'm a man, as you are!
    408572|00000000||So we's brothers now? When you imperials marched through Velen - oh, we was dogs!
    455808|00000000||Not to me. I have deserted. I wish to go home, to my wife…
    455810|00000000||Well, she waits for naught. Boiko, get the rope… Whoreson hangs, that's that.
   1046948|00000000||Me cows give sour milk, me cat sleeps with the rats, me pigs squeal the night through… Ye know what that means?
   1046950|00000000||You're a shite farmer?
   1046952|00000000||What? No, mate! War's comin'! That's what it means!
   1052433|00000000||How much is the cod?
   1052435|00000000||Ten crowns apiece.
   1052437|00000000||Looks fresh enough. Let's take some.
   1052439|00000000||But, but, but! I've cod for eight crowns apiece - and it looks even fresher.
   1052441|00000000||In that case we'll take one, gutted and filleted.
   1052443|00000000||You'll pay for this. I'll burn that bloody stall of yours down!
    578265|00000000||You play gwent, don't you?
   1013711|00000000||Oh, sure, 'cause I'm a dwarf, is that it? Do you also believe I know every other bleedin' dwarf in existence, and that at the end of each day I deepen the mineshaft in my cellar?
   1042529|00000000||So you play or not?
   1042531|00000000||Aye, I play.
    578269|00000000||So play me. Stake a unique card, maybe?
   1042541|00000000||Why not.
    578262|00000000||Let's play a round.
    522535|00000000||Play you some other time.
    578263|00000000||We'll play later.
    578267|00000000||Still out to beat me?
    578268|00000000||Ah, see your still seekin' to lose. I'm game.
    578264|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    578277|00000000||Can't rightly recall the last time I was so thoroughly thrashed. The card's yours.
   1013724|00000000||Tried your best. Tell me, who else could have worthwhile cards?
   1076526|00000000||There's Marquise Serenity, for instance. She don't boast about it, but she has one of the best decks in town and uses it damn well. I know what I'm talkin' about.
    578271|00000000||Play you later. Gotta go now.
    578276|00000000||Try some shoddier players, will ye? Once you've learned a few tricks, come back for a rematch.
    578279|00000000||Hm, some Scoia'tael dregs hang about Oxenfurt. There's an elf among 'em has a unique. I've also heard tell of a druid named Ermion. Bugger's deck is supposedly legendary.
    546046|00000000||Movement… Oughta keep my ears open.
   1073884|00000000||Rustling - over there.
    446620|00000000||What's with the door?
    446622|00000000||You wished to leave… as Graham did.
    446624|00000000||What do you want?
    446626|00000000||No more lies, no more deceit!
    453531|00000000||You will stay here for all time! You will never leave!
   1019161|00000000||Hm, managed to amass quite a book collection.
   1019163|00000000||Ordinary ointment… nothing special.
   1019165|00000000||Don't often see baubles like this in Velen…
   1001091|00000000||You're lying. Badly.
   1001098|00000000||Something stinks. And I don't mean the corpses.
   1001106|00000000||I'm nosy. Very.
   1001118|00000000||You're hiding something. Gonna find out what it is.
   1001119|00000000||There's naught here. Black Ones didn't even find anythin'.
   1001120|00000000||Outta my way.
   1001115|00000000||Someone's paid me to dwell.
   1024648|00000000||And who might that be?
   1018412|00000000||That's for me to know. Gonna look around . Best stay out of my way.
   1001105|00000000||It's my job.
   1001122|00000000||Your choice. Not about to stay where I'm not wanted.
   1001123|00000000||Always good to hear wise words. Farewell.
   1001107|00000000||So be it.
   1001100|00000000||It was how it was. Why dwell on it?
   1001092|00000000||This'd be the first time ghouls came to help out a village in trouble. At this rate, they'll be taking jobs off the notice boards before long.
   1001090|00000000||Never seen ghouls come to the rescue.
    552639|00000000||What happened?
    552642|00000000||Nilfgaardians came plunderin'… Lookin' for valuables - as if we was rich.
   1014883|00000000||Who killed them? Couldn't 'ave been you.
   1014885|00000000||I dunno. Must've been those beasts you slaughtered.
    552636|00000000||Ah, a witcher.
    374416|00000000||The gods, they protected me. I must make an offering.
    374414|00000000||Death on a mount, galloping…
    374418|00000000||Ice as in the depths of winter - and all of a sudden.
    374412|00000000||Horrid riders…
    466943|00000000||I had my reasons.
    466955|00000000||I had my reasons. Your leg'd be fine if you hadn't gotten in my way.
    466957|00000000||I see. Well, I promise you that if I could go back in time, I'd do things quite differently on Thanedd.
    466959|00000000||For example, I'd have my men kill you instead of just tying you up.
    452413|00000000||Thanks for your help, Dijkstra.
    452415|00000000||Just go, witcher.
    547318|00000000||And if you can't find the slimy bastard, come and see me. I know him well, might figure something out.
    365899|00000000||See if I can't find Whoreson at the casino or the arena. Might talk to Cleaver as well, though.
    439257|00000000||Do what you will, just be cautious. Whoreson's expecting payback, I've no doubt.
    365883|00000000||Time I went to look for Whoreson.
    365895|00000000||Where's Junior's casino?
    372511|00000000||Near the Temple Watch towers…
    452674|00000000||Whoreson's got nowt to do with the casino officially, so careful what you say, try not to arouse any suspicions.
    365875|00000000||Casino - where is it?
    512042|00000000||Mentioned Whoreson's got a house. Where is it?
    512043|00000000||Solid townhouse on Temple Isle, just on the other side of the bridge. Wouldn't wager me knickers on finding him there. Junior's not that stupid.
    512029|00000000||Where's he got this house?
    365879|00000000||How do I find the arena?
    439253|00000000||Arena sounds promising. Where's that?
    426470|00000000||Sewers beneath Gildorf, but you'll have to enter through the Bits, endure the stench of poverty on the way.
    512001|00000000||Now, Junior loves a good fight. Wager he'd give a lot to see a real witcher in action.
    439277|00000000||Hmm, makes sense to ask around, I guess… Junior might be in hiding, but he's gotta be collecting income, couldn't afford to cut himself off.
    452259|00000000||Gambling - that's his big earner. Junior controls the largest casino in town. I'll never forget - Hierarch Hemmelfart raised all kinds of hallowed hell there once. Bugger bet and lost his ruby ring.
    452261|00000000||Then there's the arena in the city's bowels. Betting scheme generates near as much as the casino. They're always looking for hired muscle there.
    512028|00000000||Suppose you could always search Whoreson's house, though I doubt you'll find him there. Maybe some clue, though.
    439108|00000000||Whoreson - what's he own, where's he strong?
    463115|00000000||Your partners aware of your past? They know you're Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence?
    463117|00000000||Heheh. Cleaver, Bedlam and Junior, well, I'd call them my partners if we'd built a mill to grind flour for the folk of nearby hamlets.
    463119|00000000||But we just need to stay out of each others' ways, agree from time to time. That doesn't make us partners.
    463121|00000000||Do they know who I am, was? Bedlam - sure. The others most likely suspect. But we just don't talk about it. No need to.
    463113|00000000||Your colleagues aware of your past?
    439110|00000000||Intent on avoiding a war with Whoreson? Why?
    439273|00000000||Pretty clear you and Bedlam don't want a war with Junior. Why?
    439275|00000000||Let me tell you what I told King Vizimir time and time again: war doesn't solve any problems. It breeds trouble, trouble you then have to solve by other means.
    452253|00000000||Make no mistake - someone's behind Whoreson's actions. I'll not end him until I know who.
    379653|00000000||Whoreson Junior - how do I find him?
    439102|00000000||Think Cleaver'll find Whoreson?
    439104|00000000||He might, he might not. But he'll burn down half the city trying. What waste. Leave him to it, I say, work alone.
    372456|00000000||Any ideas?
    439106|00000000||Junior's got areas of the city where he's strong. Penetrate them, look around. But be discrete - none of this speed and fury and swinging your steel cock about.
    466949|00000000||Listen, Reuven… No, Dijkstra - just not in the mood for your code names, passwords and other bullshit.
    466951|00000000||I'm here on specific business. If you wanna listen, listen, if not - I'd rather you spared me your wit and threw me out now.
    466953|00000000||Ah, what's the harm? Talk.
    466945|00000000||Sorry to hear that.
    466947|00000000||You're sorry? Well, consider it resolved, then. Now, mind showing some added compassion? Could mean a miraculous recovery to me.
    466941|00000000||Sorry to hear that.
    466933|00000000||Right mess that was… Never thought I'd be glad to see the man responsible for my taking frequent baths.
    466935|00000000||If you're any cleaner for it, gotta say it was worth breaking your ankle.
    466937|00000000||It healed poorly - can you believe it?
    466939|00000000||I must soak it in hot water at least six times a day now… Failing that, it bloody pounds like the bells of Beauclair at dawn.
    376603|00000000||Got a minute?
    376605|00000000||I do. What do you want?
    376527|00000000||You in contact with Radovid?
    383401|00000000||You in contact with Radovid?
    383403|00000000||Hahahaha. See you're witty as ever. No, I'm not in contact with him and I'd prefer it remained that way.
    383405|00000000||Never quite forgave you for conspiring with Philippa Eilhart?
    383407|00000000||Radovid doesn't forgive. Not anything. Not anyone. And especially not the sorceress of the Lodge.
    383399|00000000||Any news of Philippa?
    383525|00000000||Philippa Eilhart - had any news?
    383527|00000000||Just good.
    383529|00000000||Meaning?
    383531|00000000||After Radovid popped her eyes out, she disappeared without a trace. If I've any luck, she's finally eating dirt.
    383533|00000000||Thought you two were close…
    383535|00000000||We were. Until Philippa sent assassins after me.
   1034741|00000000||See you're still dabbling in politics…
   1034743|00000000||Surprised to see you still dabbling in politics.
   1034744|00000000||It's quite simple, Geralt. I cannot be indifferent to Redania's fate. Call it… patriotic concern.
   1034745|00000000||Huh, so it's concern that compels you to bump off Radovid?
   1034746|00000000||I think often of the country and its future. And the more I think, the clearer it becomes that as long as Radovid sits on the throne, Redania has no future.
    376615|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    376617|00000000||Got things to do myself. So long!
    376533|00000000||Farewell.
    376529|00000000||Master spy to master criminal… Interesting progression.
    383409|00000000||From master spy to master criminal… Interesting progression.
    383411|00000000||Why? Truth be told they're awfully similar. Both about maintaining a net of informers, being tough in negotiations, bribing officials… the occasional assassination. Same old shit.
    383413|00000000||Yeah… Except you used to do that in the name of some ideal. And now?
    383415|00000000||Now I've decided I've slaved enough for ideals. It's time I worked for myself. And thus far, it's been going rather well.
   1054341|00000000||Finally someone took pity! Thank you, witcher!
    439612|00000000||What's going on here?
    439614|00000000||Fungus in the city. We're scrubbin' it clean.
    450339|00000000||Why you wincin' that mug like you stepped barefoot in dung?
    439620|00000000||Mind your manners.
    450341|00000000||Mind our--? Heh, be glad we didn't smash your snout, mutt!
    450343|00000000||Wait. Grab him. I'll teach him his place.
    439616|00000000||Mind your manners.
    439622|00000000||Relax. I'm going.
    450345|00000000||Hah! Look at that - tail between his arsecheeks!
    439624|00000000||Freaks're learnin' their place. Slow, but they're learnin'.
    439618|00000000||I'm going.
    439630|00000000||That's her!
    450548|00000000||Seize the whore! Alive!
   1014710|00000000||Heart removed, embers where the yes should be, mouth burned with formaldehyde… a familiar sight.
   1014712|00000000||And a letter… "You sought a servant of the Eternal Fire. Yet you were blinded by its flame."
   1014722|00000000||Wasn't Nathaniel. Dammit.
   1014715|00000000||Aaaaaaaaaa!

   1044030|00000000||Isengrim Faoiltiarna from the Scoia'tael deck. Wonder how much this card's worth.
   1005286|00000000||Welcome, White One.
   1005300|00000000||The heavens have opened.
   1005293|00000000||Greetings.
   1005297|00000000||Greetings.
   1005312|00000000||Oh?
   1005319|00000000||What are you doing?
    381009|00000000||Silver lid… Matches the cylinder bottom I found in the sewer…
    381011|00000000||Dijkstra! Come here!
    571680|00000000||*Snort* Huh?
    571682|00000000||Achoo!
    571684|00000000||Hrrk hrk! Ptooey!
    509726|00000000||Achoo!
    509614|00000000||Heathen dwarves in Novigrad have molded a golem out of Pontar mud…
    509616|00000000||…At night it hunts those who believe in the Eternal Fire, breaks their necks!
    509618|00000000||I want to believe you made that up…
    510118|00000000||See you at the pub tonight?
    510119|00000000||I don't know…
    509700|00000000||Eternal Fire light your path!
    509702|00000000||Where're you rushing off to?
    509704|00000000||I won't talk with you.
    509716|00000000||Out of here!
    509706|00000000||Just you wait, the witch hunters'll see to you!
    509718|00000000||Cat eyes… Mark o' the devil.
    509708|00000000||Why?!
    509710|00000000||Sword, he's got a sword!
    509712|00000000||Have mercy!
    509714|00000000||Faith, hope, the Eternal Fire…
   1043905|00000000||You arrogant arsehole!
    594937|00000000||Stop pesterin'.
    594939|00000000||Make one false move…
    594941|00000000||Dum dum duh dum dum…
    594943|00000000||You fucking twat!
    594945|00000000||Hit the mutant!
   1019255|00000000||You'll rot in the dungeon.
   1072752|00000000||Now you've done it.
   1072754|00000000||Wise.
   1072756|00000000||Put your sword away, now.
    467307|00000000||Where're the women? Where's the entertainment?!
   1052473|00000000||I'm it.
   1043944|00000000||Secret door behind a bookcase. Classic.

    525756|dce868ca||Young Arachas
   1025539|00000000||Listen… It's Beatrice, I've fallen in love with her, alas. Pen me a sonnet, would you?
   1025541|00000000||A sonnet? Tough genre. It'll cost you a few crowns.
   1025543|00000000||So you'll not write it for free? But, it would be an invaluable experience… and you could add it to your guild card!
   1025545|00000000||Gratis I can offer you this couplet: "All cheapskates, skinflints, penny minders: go plough yourselves, you fucking misers!"
   1025547|00000000||The cheek! It's true what they say - every bard is a lazy good-for-nothing!
   1052191|00000000||Seen a longship from Skellige in the port.
   1052193|00000000||Me too. Not about to go back there till them apes sail off.
   1052195|00000000||I tell ye, never seen such a hunk o' crooked planks in me life. What sort o' blind shipwrights they got there?
   1052197|00000000||Their tubs might not be pretty, but they're light and swift. Could outrun any ship comes outta the Novigrad drydocks.
    543775|00000000||Why you leerin' at me Helga? Eh?! Pointy-eared fuck!
    543797|00000000||Leave me be! I didn't even glance at her!
    544964|00000000||Meanin' what? Sayin' she's ugly? Why, I'm gonna…
    360896|00000000||Age before beauty.
    360898|00000000||Nah, this is the trough, and you the bigger drunk. I insist.
    360902|00000000||You'd truly do me an honor by grantin' me the - hic-cup! - privilege to let you pass.
    465196|00000000||Noooo. You got booted first last time. You've a right to lead.
    405088|00000000||Dijkstra… and Triss?
    488648|00000000||Glad you're here. Listen…
    517836|00000000||Took a look at the building and it does not look good.
    488650|00000000||Mean it could use a bit of paint and spackle?
    488652|00000000||I mean it's a damned fortress. High walls, guards at the gate, armed men everywhere. We could never sneak in, and fighting our way in won't work - Menge would have plenty of time to escape.
    488654|00000000||What do you suggest?
    488656|00000000||Take these shackles… Put them on me.
    488662|00000000||Uh, Triss… Sure you want to do this? Out here? With everyone watching?
    488666|00000000||This might come as a surprise to you, but shackles do have uses outside the bedroom.
    488658|00000000||Uh, Triss. Sure about this? Here and now?
    488657|00000000||Mind explaining what this is about?
    488660|00000000||Mind explaining what this is all about?
    488679|00000000||Think… Bring the hunters the vile Triss Merigold, they won't just open the gate for you, they're likely to let you present her to Menge personally.
    495410|00000000||No way. Too risky.
    495412|00000000||Dandelion's life's on the line… Ciri's too. No such thing as too risky.
    488687|00000000||Really wanna do this?
    488689|00000000||Triss, think about it… Really want to walk into the lion's den of your own free will - and in chains?
    488691|00000000||Yes.
    488693|00000000||No. Can't allow it.
    488695|00000000||Nice of you to worry… But I've made my decision, and I won't change it.
    488686|00000000||All right… But what then?
    488701|00000000||Fine, let's say they take the bait… What then? We go in, I put a sword to Menge's throat and ask him where Dandelion is?
    488711|00000000||Might not work. Menge's scum, but you have to admit… Death doesn't scare him.
    496051|00000000||Always found that annoying in fanatics. So we gotta trick him into talking. Any ideas?
    488715|00000000||Uhh… Maybe tell him you have information about the Lodge - or about Philippa, even better, he hates her most of all. You'll think of something.
    491305|00000000||Wait, wanted to thank you.
    491307|00000000||Wait. I wanna thank you.
    491309|00000000||Come on. Anyone would do this…
    491311|00000000||No. Not anyone.
    491313|00000000||Stop. It doesn't befit a sorceress to blush.
    495406|00000000||What about the treasure?
    495414|00000000||What about the treasure?
    495416|00000000||If we learn anything, great. If not…
    495417|00000000||Thought you need coin from Dijkstra to help the other mages.
    495418|00000000||True, I do… Lots of ways to get gold, though. It's just not the most important thing now.
    491304|00000000||Let's go.
    491315|00000000||Still got a bad feeling about this… But tough. Let's go.
    488664|00000000||You're back… Put the shackles on me and let's go. Just please… Don't do anything stupid.
   1039286|00000000||Ah, a mutant.
   1039284|00000000||Witcher, friend!
   1039288|00000000||Greetin's.
   1039290|00000000||Ptooey! Evil eye.
   1039292|00000000||Maybe you'd join us? Pretty damn profitable, pillagin' is.
    485005|00000000||We witchers have our ways.
    485012|00000000||I thank you. Very much. The dreams, they were awful. Any way I can pay you back?
    485013|00000000||There is, actually. I'm looking for a young woman who was seen in Novigrad.
    485014|00000000||I can certainly try to help. But I'll need to clear my head first. After those deranged dreams, I feel it's full of cobwebs. Find me at the Golden Sturgeon. I rent a room there.
    485015|00000000||All right. See you there.
    485003|00000000||I told Sarah… I mean, the godling… Told her Novigrad's no place for godlings and creatures like them.
    484977|00000000||Who are you?
    484978|00000000||Triss Merigold sent me to see you...
    493687|00000000||Gods… Horrible nightmares. I was supposed to dream the history of this house… Instead, I saw furniture, hungry furniture that wished to devour me…
    493689|00000000||I know it must sound foolish, but in the dream - well, it was all too real… and not at all amusing.
    493691|00000000||The work of a godling. She made people believe the house was haunted. Also injected your dreams with her little jokes.
    484979|00000000||And you managed to wake me? I feel fortunate.
    462646|00000000||Greetings. At your service.
   1010251|00000000||It's raining buckets.
   1010249|00000000||Greetings.
   1010247|00000000||Set things right, witcher!
   1010245|00000000||Waste of words.
   1010243|00000000||That's unthinkable!
   1010241|00000000||Run, if you value your lives!
   1015041|00000000||Greetings.
   1028749|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    421081|00000000||So long.
    421077|00000000||Farewell.
    421075|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421079|00000000||What else you have on offer?
    497782|00000000||Corpse teeth and kidney stones - tried remedies for trying times!
    421073|00000000||An amulet? A bezoar? Some tortoiseshells?
    545346|391ece5b||Boatwright
    416294|00000000||Tracks lead to a burrow. Wonder what's inside.
    580427|00000000||Sod off, skiver.
    580429|00000000||Lookin' to make some coin too, eh?
    546031|00000000||Help me, master!
    594887|00000000||I know you from somewhere.
    594889|00000000||Elven blood, eh?
    594893|00000000||From now on assume your every move's observed.
    594891|00000000||Together!
    594895|00000000||Oh, yeah! That'll heal come time for the funeral.
   1019247|00000000||The sword - put it away.
   1072738|00000000||What're you doing?!
   1072740|00000000||You asked for it. Hah.
   1072742|00000000||Good dog.
   1038265|00000000||It's hardly compensation for your losses, but at least the hound won't destroy any more hives.
   1038267|00000000||Thank you, witcher! It's true, nothing like hiring a specialist!
   1038261|00000000||I roused him out, but he got away.
   1038263|00000000||Got away? Do you mean he could return? Ooph, that is not what we hired you to do. Job's only half done - you're entitled to half the pay.
   1039689|00000000||Good enough for me. Farewell.
   1038175|00000000||Your apiarian phantom was a hound of the Wild Hunt.
   1047290|00000000||Eternal Fire! Hounds run with the Wild Hunt as well?!
   1038181|00000000||About two weeks back I woke suddenly in the night. Saw the Hunt streaking across the sky!
   1038183|00000000||Hound must've gotten separated then. Couldn't go back, so it hid in the empty house.
   1038195|00000000||How did you fare?
   1038197|00000000||Did you drive off the phantom?
   1038201|00000000||Enough for today, boys. Let's go home. We've a big day tomorrow - must rebuild the hives the hound destroyed.
   1038205|00000000||Work and more work - never-ending story…
   1038269|00000000||Strange that witcher couldn't vanquish the hound.
   1038271|00000000||Well, he did what he could. We all trip up sometimes.
   1013489|00000000||All right. See you later, Sasha.
   1017734|00000000||Try to chat up the other players before the tournament begins. We must all wait for Count Tybalt anyway.
   1013487|00000000||See you later.
   1013261|00000000||The other participants - who are they?
   1013263|00000000||Come to the Passiflora often? Seem to know everyone.
   1013388|00000000||I'm here from time to time. I cannot say all the faces are familiar, but… that is Patrick Hazelnutt. Never goes anywhere without those three.
   1013476|00000000||Met a man once who traveled with two Zerrikanian warrior women as bodyguards. But those three…
   1013533|00000000||Have other talents, clearly. The halfling's Bernard Tulle, a farmer. Claims to play for pleasure, but everyone wants to win, don't they?
   1013576|00000000||Best beware of that one. He's not particularly fond of… others, outcasts, types like you. Ironic, since Finneas himself is a half-elf.
   1013602|00000000||And I'm certain you've heard of Count Tybalt. After all, he is the one who organized this tournament.
   1013605|00000000||Actually, I haven't heard of him.
   1013606|00000000||He's reputed to be fabulously wealthy. I can't say how true it is, but he was able to afford his title and the county that came with it.
   1013274|00000000||We know each other?
   1013276|00000000||Let's say we've some mutual acquaintances. I've heard many good things about you. In vivid detail.
   1013285|00000000||Hm, place like this, that's more a warning than a recommendation. What's your name?
   1013287|00000000||Sasha.
   1013341|00000000||Sasha what? Or maybe just skip right to telling me your real name.
   1013366|00000000||Place like this, Sasha will need to suffice.
   1013259|00000000||Well, well. Geralt of Rivia. And I was beginning to think this tournament would be a dreadful bore.
   1013272|00000000||I'm afraid winning coin from peasants, thugs and faux aristocrats is no great source of satisfaction for me.
    478331|00000000||Footsteps… Not good.
    478329|00000000||"Ciri… Menge is following me… He has seized the treasure… He has Dandelion…"
    489051|00000000||"You must flee."
    472998|00000000||Drunk old fool totterin' about again?
    473000|00000000||Aye, set the stable afire!
    473697|00000000||We gotta put it out!
    475037|00000000||I'll not go near there. Got a lot to live for, still.
    473699|00000000||Don't know who can calm 'im with Tammy gone.
    474217|00000000||They didn't run away - you drove them out.
    474221|00000000||Gotta admit I do think you're a prick. Not because you couldn't control them, but because you drove them away.
    474225|00000000||What?
    474227|00000000||Don't play the idiot. You gave them no choice.
    476110|00000000||No matter. I know how to find them.
    476112|00000000||Doesn't much matter now. I know how to find them.
    476114|00000000||How?
    476116|00000000||I know about the baby.
    476126|00000000||Anna… and I… It wasn't as it seemed, seems…
    366661|00000000||I'd been soakin' myself three days straight. Anna came to me, said they were leaving. I begged them to stay. She refused to hear it.
    366675|00000000||I tried to stop her. She wriggled like an eel, we struggled… she fell.
    474234|00000000||Last blasted thing I remember. Woke up in the morn, breeches heavy with me own piss, a large bump on my head. Sadly, they were gone.
    366738|00000000||Know what that's like, witcher? No, how the fuck could you? I was left with nothing! Nothing! Only the bottle…
    400283|00000000||What about the signs of fighting in the room?
    400289|00000000||Signs of a fight in the room - hole in the wall, wine all over the landing. Was that you?
    529250|00000000||Aye. We tussled… She tried to whack me on the noggin with a candlestick, but kept missin'. Hit the wall and the pillar instead.
    400291|00000000||I staggered backwards onto the table. Spilled the wine, slipped and tumbled.
    529251|00000000||Anna used that moment to flee. She rushed down the stairs, still clutchin' that damn candlestick.
    529252|00000000||I caught her on the landin'. We fell, I-- I thought I had her… then she turned and smacked me in the head.
    474236|00000000||I blacked out, don't know what happened next. When I came to, I was alone.
    400285|00000000||Tamara witness this?
    400326|00000000||Tamara present for all this? She see you quarrel?
    400328|00000000||Through the doorway, perhaps. She didn't enter the room. Shame, too - things might've turned out differently.
   1058008|00000000||The sight of her always calmed me.
    400287|00000000||What happened next?
    400336|00000000||What happened next?
    400338|00000000||Next… it only got worse. I awoke at sunset, not knowin' how many days had passed.
    400346|00000000||Thought it was all a ploughin' drunken nightmare. An' then I went to the bedchamber, but Anna was not there. Instead… there was blood, everywhere.
   1058010|00000000||I knew. She'd miscarried. My breath short, my throat locked, I neared the bed… and saw it.
    400348|00000000||It lay there. A tiny thing, defenseless… on bloodied sheets… dead. And it was my doing.
    474274|00000000||Seen a lot of dead in my time, but that must've been hard.
    474283|00000000||Unspeakably so. My legs gave out. Saw fields of corpses at Sodden… saw witches burn in Maribor…
    474285|00000000||But compared to this… all that was a rabbit's prick alongside a great oak. And the guilt is all mine.
   1058044|00000000||We don't know that yet. The amulet Anna wore - could be linked somehow. Maybe the fact that she lost it.
    474287|00000000||What did you do with the child?
    474289|00000000||Wrapped it in a clean sheet and buried it.
    474272|00000000||Must've been a terrible sight.
    366903|00000000||What did you do with the child?
   1058042|00000000||Maybe your doing, maybe not - but that amulet she wore could be important. Or maybe the fact that she lost it.
    367394|00000000||What did you do with the child?
    367425|00000000||What was I to do? Took it out and buried it.
    474291|00000000||Just like that?
    474293|00000000||Damn you! I gave no thought to a funeral. It was a horror, I wanted it to end.
    474295|00000000||That child had been my dream. I told Anna, "A little one, our little one, to make things right." Yet she died before she could be born.
    474297|00000000||Understand, witcher? My child was dead.
    474317|00000000||I sympathize, I do.
    474319|00000000||Thank you. And know that I hope you find your Ciri.
    474321|00000000||Deal we made means I need to find Tamara and Anna first. Just so happens your unborn daughter might help us do that.
    474301|00000000||I feel your pain.
    474299|00000000||Keep it together, man.
    474309|00000000||Get hold of yourself. Men like you, when they break down, look downright pathetic.
    474311|00000000||You're a heartless bastard.
    474313|00000000||Huh, mutations worked, then.
    474315|00000000||But here's the good news - your dead child might help us find the one who's still alive… and your wife.
    474347|00000000||You don't need the details.
    474355|00000000||Details you don't need to know. There's a bond of blood between this creature and your wife and daughter. I can use that bond to find them.
    400365|00000000||Well? Ready?
    474489|00000000||And try to sober up.
    474491|00000000||Do I take a shovel? To dig up the grave?
    474493|00000000||Take it. You'll need it, but not for that.
    393208|00000000||Then wait here with me. Near midnight I'll take you to where I buried her.
    400367|00000000||Get word to the common folk. Oughta stay in their homes tonight and draw a line of salt outside their doors.
    393189|00000000||Let's do this.
    393210|00000000||Need to tend to something first.
    393212|00000000||Be quick. And me? What am I to do in the meantime?
    413599|00000000||Sober up.
    393191|00000000||Come get you later.
    393179|00000000||Whatever we do, we gotta find the botchling first.
    393181|00000000||I'll show you where I buried her. And I'll dig the grave at my threshold.
    394032|00000000||If it turns out we can't transform the botchling into a lubberkin, they can bury us in it. Handy either way.
    474451|00000000||Where'd you bury the fetus? Show me.
    474459|00000000||Haven't decided what I'll do.
    474475|00000000||Still not sure what to do.
    474477|00000000||Whatever you decide, we must put an end to my child's suffering.
    474357|00000000||How?
    474359|00000000||One of two ways. Legends claim you can bury a botchling under the family's threshold, perform a ritual and turn it into a lubberkin.
    474363|00000000||That's a sort of, uhh… hob, a guardian spirit that could lead me to your family.
    474433|00000000||And the other way?
    474435|00000000||We kill it and draw some blood. Take that to the pellar and he does the rest.
    474441|00000000||Do not kill my child. It's suffered enough already. Lift the curse, that it may finally rest in peace.
    474349|00000000||A cursed creature that draws strength from killing pregnant women. Once it's strong enough, it attacks those who scorned it.
    474351|00000000||But how… how does it know?
    474353|00000000||Blood ties. They're a strong bond, a bond I want to use to find your family.
    474345|00000000||Lemme explain.
    474323|00000000||What? How?
    367688|00000000||Sometimes miscarried fetuses, if they don't get a proper burial, turn into botchlings.
    367691|00000000||Into, fucking, what...?
    476147|00000000||Don't much care what you have to say.
    476149|00000000||I'm supposed to find your family, and I will. With your dead baby's help.
    476135|00000000||Not interested.
    476120|00000000||So tell me how it really was.
    476141|00000000||All right, I'm all ears. Tell me what happened. The truth this time.
    474219|00000000||Tell me everything you remember about the day they fled. The truth this time.
    474215|00000000||How did they flee? What happened?
    473958|00000000||You knew they had run away from the start.
    473960|00000000||Yes, I knew.
    473962|00000000||Why didn't you tell me? Wasted my time.
    473964|00000000||Say I had? Say I'd said I had troubles, couldn't control my wife, my daughter? What kind of flaccid prick would you take me for?
    473948|00000000||You knew they ran away.
    473977|00000000||Expect me to believe you were a loving father to Tamara? After that scene in the courtyard?
    473989|00000000||You're free to believe whatever you wish, but she was always the apple of my eye. She had the run of the place, ask anyone.
    473997|00000000||She'd ride the horses, hunt with the men, at times join them on their rounds. And they'd send for her when I flew into a rage, for only she could calm me.
    473999|00000000||Make it sound like she led a charmed life. If that's the case, why'd she run?
    474213|00000000||I'd hardly need you if I knew.
    473952|00000000||Never hit your daughter? Really?
    473950|00000000||Anna - how'd she get you angry?
    473966|00000000||Your wife - how'd she make you angry? Too much salt in the soup? Socks never darned?
    473968|00000000||Twenty years we've known each other. She's seen me drunk and sober, she was there to greet me when I returned the victor, she was there to patch me up in defeat.
    473975|00000000||Like no other, she knew where to press, where to pinch, so it would hurt.
    473983|00000000||You beat her? For that? For criticizing you?
    473985|00000000||Argh, witcher, you haven't a clue, have you. Well, perhaps I shall tell you about it one day. One day, but not today.
    476106|00000000||Sit down.
    473938|00000000||You beat them.
    473940|00000000||I never laid a finger on Tamara, not once.
    473942|00000000||And on Anna?
    473944|00000000||That's another story.
    473946|00000000||She always knew how to spark my ire.
    476104|00000000||We need to talk.
    473302|00000000||Are you outta your fuckin' mind?!
    473304|00000000||You, you… where do I know you from, eh?
    473786|00000000||Ah, right! The witcher! Come, drink with me! Pale as a ghost, you are!
    473473|00000000||Hahahahaah! We've a hero in our midst!
    473796|00000000||The horses! Why, I'm prepared to forgive you the drubbin' you gave those pricks at the Crossroads!
    473798|00000000||You've earned yourself a barrel of Lyrian!
    473294|00000000||I know your wife miscarried. Was that before or after you beat her to a pulp?
    473296|00000000||What the fuck're you suggesting?!
    473298|00000000||Don't play me for a fool. You'd been beating them for years. Finally, they'd had enough and fled. Sound about right?
    473300|00000000||Aaarrrrggghhh…
    473306|00000000||They ran from you, didn't they?
    473308|00000000||Lying prick!
    474457|00000000||I'll try to lift the curse. No promises, though. Story of the transformation could be nothing but wives' tales.
    474461|00000000||We must try. They say every legend holds a grain of truth.
    474471|00000000||Not gonna play around with folk rituals. Rather kill it, let the pellar do the rest.
    474473|00000000||Don't be rash. Make sure it's the only way.
   1053121|700b14f8||Errant Troll
   1073712|00000000||Anyone see you come in?
   1073768|00000000||No one apart from Madame Serenity and your lackey.
   1073714|00000000||Off the street, I mean.
   1073772|00000000||No one. Nerves getting the better of you?
   1073774|00000000||I'm not nervous - just cautious. A trait you ought to nurture as well.
   1073776|00000000||I know, and I am. Wound about the streets for a time to lose any tails.
   1073778|00000000||I've worked in intelligence as long as you have. I need no lessons in spy craft.
   1073784|00000000||Thank you for agreeing to do this, Geralt.
   1073786|00000000||The sooner you finish, the better.
   1073783|00000000||Nice to chat and all, Geralt, but don't you have a job to do?
   1054286|00000000||We've a sack of mushrooms for you! For helping us!
   1032854|00000000||My husband was taken to a guard post. It's been three days now.
   1032856|00000000||I can offer no aid there.
   1032858|00000000||No aid? But the Temple Guard holds him. I've come to the Temple to ask for help.
   1032860|00000000||They did not arrest him without reason. If they hold him still, this reason persists.
    558431|00000000||Greetings.
    561782|00000000||Just in time.
    561784|00000000||Good folk! Behold the one who will protect us! Ye needn't fear!
    558432|00000000||Soon shall we summon the wandering souls. Beyond all help some will be. From these you must protect us.
    561787|00000000||Evil creatures keep at bay, keep at bay till the ritual's done.
    558460|00000000||Begin.
    558461|00000000||Keep us from harm, and let them not disturb the circle.
    558458|00000000||We can start.
    558462|00000000||Need some time to prepare.
    558467|00000000||A must is a must.
    558459|00000000||Gotta get ready.
    558475|00000000||Are you ready?
   1054347|00000000||Ah, a hearty thanks to you, Geralt!
    423075|00000000||A good one to you, young man. Hair's all a-gray, but by your face and straight back I know you to be in your youth.
    423077|00000000||Greetings. What do you sell?
    423079|00000000||Herbs, young lad. I've all sorts I gathered nearabout. You'd be surprised what useful plants grow by the roadside.
    423081|00000000||Not that surprised, actually.
    423083|00000000||Monkshood, for instance - lovely blossom, soothes aches and pains, but just a handful and you could poison a whole family. A very useful plant.
    433374|00000000||Yeah. What else would you recommend?
    433379|00000000||Have a look, young man. You seem learned in these matters, so I'll show you my special stock from under the counter.
   1086486|00000000||How about a round of gwent?
    423095|00000000||Take care.
    423091|00000000||Farewell.
    423089|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
    423093|00000000||You just might have the herbs I need.
    423087|00000000||Awfully kind of you to visit again. What sort of herbs do you need, young man?
    577831|00000000||Could you trim my hair? Grown a bit wooly.
    582739|00000000||Explain yourself.
    586521|00000000||Don't intend to. Just felt Karadin didn't deserve to be murdered in cold blood.
   1005267|00000000||If you feel otherwise, you can always go back. Without me.
   1037893|00000000||I feel like beating the shit out of you.
    582751|00000000||See you later. Some day.
    582752|00000000||So long, Lambert.
    582738|00000000||Thanks for your help, Geralt.
    586516|00000000||You're welcome.
    586518|00000000||Wanna talk about it?
   1037891|00000000||No.
    447559|00000000||Dammit! No way through! All is lost.
    447561|00000000||Relax. Maybe there's another way.
    450673|00000000||Where? The passage is straight as an arrow - not a single fork.
    450675|00000000||But listen - there's an echo behind the walls. And I can feel air coming in through the cracks.
    450677|00000000||So… something on the other side?
    450679|00000000||Mhm. Elven ruins or an old, forgotten cellar. Maybe we can get around the blockage through there.
    450681|00000000||Can't hurt to try. Got nothing to lose at this point.
    486997|00000000||Old vintages… 1235 to 1244.
    510248|00000000||Might wanna try somewhere else…
    487006|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1237.]
    487007|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1239.]

    487009|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1244.]
   1049295|00000000||Nothing happened.
   1049297|00000000||Nothing. Damn.
    487012|00000000||[Take bottle.]
    487013|00000000||[Leave bottle.]
   1049293|00000000||And... zilch.
    486996|00000000||Vintages from 1255 to 1264…
    487035|00000000||[Leave bottle.]
    487034|00000000||[Take bottle.]
    487026|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1260.]

    487028|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1263.]
    510241|00000000||[Walk away.]
    487025|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1256.]
    487032|00000000||[Leave bottle.]
    486995|00000000||1245 to 1254…
    487014|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1246.]

    487017|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1254.]
    510240|00000000||[Walk away.]
    487015|00000000||[Place bottle in cubicle for 1251.]
    487033|00000000||Hm. Satisfying click… in the next room over, I think.
    487031|00000000||[Take bottle.]
    510239|00000000||[Walk away.]
   1004327|00000000||Well, bring out the gimp.
   1004328|00000000||Think the gimp's sleepin'.
   1004329|00000000||Well, guess you'll just have to go wake him up now, won't you?
    543862|00000000||Oh yeah, where there's one freak, can't spit but hit another!
    509549|00000000||*Sigh* Lovely.
    508860|00000000||Witch hunters took his wife because she was a midwife…
    508862|00000000||… but she had droves of herbs and ointments, like a true witch.
    508866|00000000||The drill at the Temerian camp's bad, worse than at Drakenborg!
    508868|00000000||March 'em so hard, they end up carrying half out feet forward!
    508864|00000000||*Sigh* World these days…
    508870|00000000||I'm speechless.
    510116|00000000||They claim she's got a black cat? But what if she's innocent?
    510117|00000000||I'll have to think about that.
    509486|00000000||Good day.
    509488|00000000||Good day to you, sir.
    509490|00000000||Yes?
    509555|00000000||Hullo.
    509551|00000000||What's an oddity like that doing here?
    509557|00000000||You do know there're witch hunters in the city?
    509559|00000000||Witcher.
    509553|00000000||You needn't shove!
    509568|00000000||Good folk! Murderer!
    509570|00000000||Heeeelp!
    509572|00000000||Eternal Fire, protect us from all evil.
    509574|00000000||Lower your price and I'll consider it.
   1043901|00000000||Hey! What're you doing there?!
   1073640|00000000||Halt! Or we'll shoot!
   1073642|00000000||Turn back!
   1073976|00000000||Or you will be shot!
   1073644|00000000||Loose! Kill him!
   1073646|00000000||Shoot at will! He cannot pass!
   1073648|00000000||Argh, damn the bugger. The patrols will track him down.
   1073650|00000000||It's no good, you know! Patrols all around! They'll catch you! They'll deal with you!
   1073652|00000000||There! Now stay there!
   1073654|00000000||Last time you got away with that!
   1075364|00000000||If you've not had your fill of slap abouts just yet, you'll find other eager challengers in Velen and Skellige.
    506028|00000000||Durden is champion no more! Henceforth the title belongs to the drifter!
    506029|00000000||Take a good look in the mirror. You'll see your all new face, courtesy of the Tailor.
    506030|00000000||Let it be known that Durden has won the bout! And retained the title of Champion of Novigrad.
    506862|00000000||The drifter, previously crowned champion of Velen and Skellige, can now seek the title of Champion of Champions!
   1054321|00000000||Geralt of Rivia…
    519851|00000000||See his mug? Damned eyesore. Shouldn't let that refuse into taverns with ordinary folk…
    519852|00000000||Leave it… you're not on duty.
   1029785|00000000||What is it?
   1029787|00000000||Capital of the world? Bah. Nothing but chapels and brothels.
   1029789|00000000||I'd 'ave sailed back to Pont Vanis long ago if it wasn't for those Skellige pirates.
   1029791|00000000||Watch where you step!
   1029793|00000000||Guards!
   1029795|00000000||Save me… Saaaave me!
   1060196|00000000||You deaf, or you death?
   1060198|00000000||Let me alone.
   1060200|00000000||Aaaaa.
   1060202|00000000||What now? What?
   1060204|00000000||Buurrp. Akh… bleugh…
    594572|00000000||I've no small coins.
    594574|00000000||And her lad deals fisstech!
    594576|00000000||Nonhumans exhibit a natural inclination towards brigandry. Every one of them.
    567532|00000000||Wild Hunt - definitely.
    555796|00000000||They destroyed the mage's sentries? They didn't come here for a friendly chat with the elf.
   1041563|00000000||Meaning you ever thought they might've?
    555802|00000000||Froze 'em before they could attack.
    487958|00000000||Fu-uu-uck!
    487957|00000000||Heheh!
   1009019|00000000||Hello, witcher!
   1009017|00000000||Argh, some people!
   1009015|00000000||Aaaah!
    586565|00000000||Quick, shut the gate. There could be more of 'em.
    586639|00000000||Leg it! This way.
    586640|00000000||Geralt, quickly!
    501753|00000000||Dammit. Who's this now?
    501754|00000000||Cleavers' boys!
    542450|00000000||News travels fast.
    542452|00000000||Geralt, what do we do?
    439450|00000000||Know who'll give me the best price on trout?
    439452|00000000||But… 'Tain't the season for trout… Buy a bucket o' oysters - please the wife like never before!
    439446|00000000||Wanted to ask about the price of trout.
    439454|00000000||So long.
    439448|00000000||Farewell.
    425889|00000000||Wanted to ask you…
    421216|00000000||Aye? How can I be o' service?
    513034|00000000||Begone, sod off.
    355625|00000000||Even the ghouls shun me! I'll never manage on me own…
    462665|00000000||What was that?
   1071678|00000000||Wolves… perhaps?
    462667|00000000||Didn't sound like wolves.
   1071680|00000000||Because it wasn't.
    462669|00000000||Get ready.
    381736|00000000||You shall wander in fog... In fog... Forever…
    519426|00000000||Hel… Help.
    519428|00000000||A hunter of mages and witches begging a witcher for help? That's new.
    519432|00000000||Huh, you hunters sure are polite when you need something… Fine, do you a favor - against my better judgment. Gimme your hand.
    519430|00000000||All right.
    519438|00000000||No. Gonna let you die the death of a martyr in the struggle for a better tomorrow. Glory be to the Fire - yadda yadda yadda…
    519431|00000000||No.
    519435|00000000||Listen… I've lost… much blood. I need a medic to patch me up… quickly.
    523324|00000000||W-will you help?
    519434|00000000||I didn't expect…help from the likes of you.
    523321|00000000||Shouldn't be so quick to judge, maybe. A lesson your colleagues could use, too.
    449614|00000000||Half not enough for yous? Then you'll get naught, you whoresons!
    449503|00000000||So… Half for you, half for us.
    458046|00000000||There be three of yous, and four of us! It don't add up!
    458048|00000000||But it's fair. 'Twas us sussed out the old man hid his trinkets behind the outhouse!
    449505|00000000||Twas us who strangled the bugger! You was afeared!
   1070485|00000000||Bloody bandits… Can't go out in the streets no more!
   1070487|00000000||Least before they didn't used to kill women…
   1070489|00000000||Fall afoul o' the King of Beggars, and you'll get no mercy no matter who y'are!
   1004264|00000000||I asked her, "How do I get my lush to use his head? How?"
   1004265|00000000||So she gives me an amulet, says it'll quench his thirst.
   1004266|00000000||And? Did it?
   1004267|00000000||Next day he traded it for a jug of hooch!
   1017780|00000000||It were like this. First off, he had the bandits bound. Thorough like.
   1017781|00000000||Then he herded 'em in a stable… set that alight! Word is they squealed like swine goin' to slaughter…
   1017782|00000000||I heard it were the baron who's a swine for hooch. Too soused most times to herd anythin'.
   1017783|00000000||Aye, idiot tale. What'd the stable do to the baron anyways?
   1052407|00000000||Is it true you've bought three hundred ells of black cloth?
   1052409|00000000||Mhm. Deal of a lifetime.
   1052411|00000000||How so? There's a war on, folk only buy what they need, fabric grows cheaper by the week.
   1052413|00000000||But the war will end one day. And if Nilfgaard wins… black fabric will be a very valuable commodity, you'll see.
   1052415|00000000||And if Redania wins?
   1052417|00000000||Then I'll sell the cloth for shrouds. Either way, I stand to profit.
    588859|00000000||A trouble solver.
    588880|00000000||A means to solve your troubles.
    588907|00000000||What've you learned so far?
    588957|00000000||Gimme that.
    588967|00000000||Great. I'll take that now if you don't mind.
    588969|00000000||Here. Choke on it, you twit.
    589012|00000000||What can I expect to find inside?
    589018|00000000||Everything. Anything. It's an old elven temple. The witch Eilhart turned into her hideout.
    589020|00000000||Look at them. Fell into some magic trap, then monsters attacked 'em. Barely got out alive.
   1001502|00000000||Any of your men still down there?
   1001504|00000000||Dozen or so went in, they's all that came out. Rest're probably dead.
    588980|00000000||Anything else I should know?
    588988|00000000||Time I saw if Philippa's still in there…
    588990|00000000||Don't count on anyone goin' in to retrieve your corpse.
    588982|00000000||Bye.
    588981|00000000||How do you know Philippa is down there?
    588996|00000000||Think Philippa's still inside?
    588998|00000000||That we don't know. Only certain thing is she was there at some point.
    589000|00000000||Certain? How's that?
    589001|00000000||We've been after her since Loc Muinne. Pokin' out her eyes weren't enough. Radovid should've gutted her there and then.
    589002|00000000||As it is, she turned into an owl and fled. Flew across Kaedwen and Redania, then tucked herself away here.
    588963|00000000||Good work. Saved me some time.
    588965|00000000||We're thrilled.
    588955|00000000||Good work.
    588922|00000000||Word was you hadn't been able to get inside.
    588942|00000000||Till yesterday. When we found this.
    588954|00000000||Doesn't look like much, but it's got power of some sort. Opens the entrance.
    588909|00000000||Don't exactly sound delighted.
    588910|00000000||Would you expect us to? We've done half the work, now you show up to take all the glory?
    588906|00000000||You sound enthused.
    588881|00000000||Radovid sent me.
    588883|00000000||Ah, it's you… Been waiting for you.
    588878|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
    588858|00000000||A witcher.
    588853|00000000||Having trouble?
    588855|00000000||Nothing fucking but! One ploughing trouble after the other!
    588857|00000000||But what's it to you? Who are you?
    536622|00000000||Go home, merchant, and try not to come around here anymore.
    536623|00000000||I will. I mean, I won't. I mean, both, yes. Thank you, sir.
   1029753|00000000||Novigrad… the Holy See!
   1029759|00000000||Eternal Fire walk with you.
   1029751|00000000||On a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Eternal Fire?
   1029755|00000000||Ow.
   1029757|00000000||Good folk! Help!
   1029761|00000000||Eternal Fire!
   1014012|00000000||Don't try to cheat me.
   1014014|00000000||Don't try to cheat me.
   1014016|00000000||And earn a witcher's ire? I'm old, but I'm not stupid!
   1014018|00000000||We'll meet in Novigrad. I'll pay you, to the last copper. Foot soldier's honor!
   1014020|00000000||Wise.
   1014022|00000000||Wasn't it? Even the high roads are dangerous now. Not what they once were…
   1014011|00000000||Wise.
    497451|00000000||Black pearl, just like you wanted.
    497457|00000000||Beautiful, rare… like my Letta. Well, as Constable Natalis would say, you've earned a medal - or better yet, a week's leave in a brothel!
   1014008|00000000||Coin'll be fine.
   1014010|00000000||Oh yes, erm… about that. Listen… I-I feel right foolish, but… well, I didn't bring any coin with me.
    497459|00000000||Dammit. Splashing must've attracted them. You all right?
    497460|00000000||Nicked in a few places. But if I pulled through after Sodden, I'll survive this, too. So, any luck?
    486598|00000000||Menge's dead.
    486637|00000000||Menge's dead.
    486657|00000000||Ugh, a fiend. Good thing someone finally killed it.
    486662|00000000||Though another just as bad or worse will likely take its place.
    486667|00000000||Wouldn't be so quick to assume. Got a feelin' it could be a decent fellow.
    504326|00000000||What's he talkin' about?
    486160|00000000||Geralt! You recognized me! How'd you do it?
    479876|00000000||Greetings, Dudu. Heard about that souvenir Whoreson left on your face.
    479904|00000000||So… you know… everything? Have you seen Ciri?
    503984|00000000||No. Still looking for her.
    479905|00000000||Geralt! Masterful! You did great! Haven't laughed that hard in ages! Lads won't believe it when I tell 'em!
    486356|00000000||Explain one thing to me: how'd you and Dandelion manage to displease Reuven, Whoreson, and the Temple Guard all at the same time?
    486396|00000000||It's not as if we planned it…
    486552|00000000||Heheheh.
    503763|00000000||You didn't contact Priscilla. Why?
    486416|00000000||Why didn't you find Priscilla or the mummers, contact them?
    503772|00000000||I came to a few performances, different shape each time, but I dared not show myself… Feared I'd put them at risk.
    503773|00000000||Then I got word of the new mumming, saw it as my chance to learn something, anythin' about Ciri and Dandelion.
    503762|00000000||How'd you escape after the fight at Whoreson's?
    486414|00000000||I know Ciri went back to Whoreson's to get you. How'd you manage to escape?
    486443|00000000||I ran after her, wanting to keep up, but… I'd 'ave been a hindrance. She called out to me, entreated me to shape shift and disappear…
    503755|00000000||I tried to find them - Ciri and Dandelion. It was as if they'd turned to vapor. Fearing for my life, I shifted each day, becoming someone else.
    486568|00000000||Even considered turning into Ciri, to trick her pursuers, but--
    486569|00000000||Slow down, marmalade. Hmmm.
    503777|00000000||Geralt, when'd you last see Cirilla, hm? Been a while, hasn't it?
    503779|00000000||A while, yeah.
    503781|00000000||For me, likewise. Must be a full grown lass by now. Dudu, do us a wee favor - show us Ciri, for a moment.
    503784|00000000||Geralt?
    503806|00000000||I feel strange, both of you staring at me bug-eyed. Is that enough?
    503808|00000000||Yeah, plenty. Bad idea.
    503803|00000000||Transform… change into her.
    503786|00000000||Show us.
    503785|00000000||No need.
    503788|00000000||No, no need. I'll recognize Ciri when I see her. Sure of it.
    503790|00000000||I, uh… just thought you might want to see…
    503811|00000000||Not angry with me, are ye, Geralt?
    503813|00000000||No.
    503815|00000000||I feel relieved.
    503817|00000000||And Dandelion? Were you able to find him?
    503885|00000000||Witch hunters nabbed him. But there's good news, too.
    486597|00000000||We can free Dandelion - with your help.
    486644|00000000||We think we can free Dandelion. Just need your help.
    486659|00000000||What could I do?
    486670|00000000||Take on Menge's appearance. Then go and give the order for Dandelion to be moved to Oxenfurt.
    486674|00000000||We'll lay in ambush in the ravine en route. Spring Dandelion from the convoy when it rolls by.
    486685|00000000||Wait… Not so fast. How am I to be Menge? And I've no notion where Dandelion's being held…
    489329|00000000||No one else knows Menge's dead.
    489449|00000000||No one knows Menge's dead. Don't need to worry about being exposed.
    489451|00000000||No one… save you? Would this have anything to do with the fire at the witch hunters' barracks?
    489453|00000000||We were in the area.
    489455|00000000||Heheh… I sorely regret not seein' that!
    489328|00000000||Dandelion's on Temple Isle.
    489389|00000000||Dandelion's on Temple Isle. Imprisoned there. You'll need to find out exactly where.
    489521|00000000||But what if they grow suspicious? Start asking questions?
    489523|00000000||I'll bet my best axe no one'll pester the commander of the Temple Guard.
    489529|00000000||Besides, you're a doppler and an actor - and an actor and a doppler. Got double the spark to improvise your way outta any situation.
    489537|00000000||Things get spicy you'll just nip round the corner and transform into a buxom wench, a jackdaw or whatever else strikes your fancy.
    489531|00000000||Of course. It's that simple. Thanks.
    489446|00000000||You'll be fine.
    489447|00000000||Listen, you'll manage. Everybody believes Menge's missing. You can make up any story you want.
    489462|00000000||Me lads and me'll lie in ambush in the ravine. Geralt'll then join us and we'll await word from ye.
   1066495|00000000||But how am I to contact you as Menge? Send word that the convoy's left?
   1066497|00000000||You'll need to figure that out. Come on, guile's your middle name.
    489519|00000000||So? We all clear? Dudu, get your arse to Temple Isle. I'm off to assemble my crew, and we'll be waitin' for ye, Geralt.
   1063186|00000000||Yeah. Meet you in the ravine.
   1063193|00000000||We could use a bit of support. Lemme talk to Dijkstra.
   1063218|00000000||Catch him in a good mood, and he just might lend us a few bodies.
   1063220|00000000||We'd manage, we would, with just my lads, but if you miss Sigi that much…
   1063222|00000000||He's the one's got a soft spot for me. Said so himself recently.
   1063187|00000000||We could use some help. Lemme talk to Dijkstra.
   1063189|00000000||Yeah. See you in the ravine.
   1066517|00000000||Whoa! Wait! Hold on! What happens after? I-I hope you don't expect me to continue as Menge, live like Chappelle, burning the occasional heretic to keep up appearances…?
   1066501|00000000||No, once it's over, we expect to see you at the Rosemary and Thyme, where we'll all meet…
   1066503|00000000||…to get pissed like wild badgers. So? Settled? Let's get to work!
   1050653|00000000||You were marvelous! Not a single mistake!
   1074669|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I fear I'd be more successful hunting a beast than you were on stage.
   1075587|00000000||Could be. You'd still be wiser not to try.
   1050651|00000000||Not bad, not bad at all… for your first time out. Just a few minor trip-ups.
   1050647|00000000||The performance in general - what'd you think?
   1050649|00000000||I doubt the audience understood it all, but that's to be expected.
   1050655|00000000||I'm just pleased the Puffins got the word out. That was quite the crowd.
   1050645|00000000||You were right to cast Abelard as the Prince. It's likely Maxim would have shown up drunk as a fish, or forgotten about the premiere altogether.
   1050643|00000000||Such a shame Maxim went on stage inebriated after all… Some of the crowd demanded refunds.
   1050639|00000000||Here you are - your fee. I must admit your style of mumming, well, it's quite… minimalist. Did you study anywhere?
   1050641|00000000||At Kaer Morhen. Minimum expression means maximum effect. Thanks for the coin. Take care, now.
   1053806|00000000||Those boys wantin' to guide the merchants to Oxenfurt - what became of 'em?
   1053808|00000000||Don't know. They never came back.
   1053810|00000000||Must've stayed on the other side o' the Pontar, lucky snots.
   1053812|00000000||Or maybe somethin' attacked 'em 'long the way. Might be good to walk out there, look… But I'm afeared to go in the woods.
    462144|00000000||Look like claw marks. But here… an arrow. Shaft's broken off right at the skin.
    462146|00000000||Looted bare. Either someone stole the cargo after the monster attack, or our monster collects military paraphernalia.
    462148|00000000||Footprints. A survivor? Either that or the monster's a humanoid.
    470573|00000000||Clawed and gnawed. Necrophages fed here… but all the wounds they inflicted are post-mortem.
    471568|00000000||Something's fishy here… I should follow these tracks.
   1010166|00000000||Hello!
   1010164|00000000||Good day.
   1010162|00000000||How human…
   1010160|00000000||Save yourselves!
   1010158|00000000||Run! Save yourselves!
   1014949|00000000||Hello!
    576107|00000000||P-please stop… I surrender.
    576108|00000000||Might be able to look like a witcher, but that won't make you fight like one.
    576109|00000000||Yet donning your skin's enough to know what kind of man you are… what you feel…
    576127|00000000||I don't kill 'em, true. But then, not everybody applies my rules, and not everyone's got my conscience. So start stealing somewhere else. Far from Novigrad, preferably. Golden age of dopplers ended here a while ago.
    591935|00000000||I know. But I thought they'd not catch me, I thought myself too smart. Serves me right. Might've learned this lesson the hard way. Time to go, somewhere far away… But first, take this - as a token of my gratitude. So long, witcher.
    576112|00000000||Gotta leave Novigrad - no excuses.
    576128|00000000||You learned something, but not everything. I spare any monsters that aren't dangerous.
    591940|00000000||Thing is, you attacked me. Unprovoked. So that doesn't apply to you.
    576111|00000000||Glad to make an exception in your case. Draw your weapon.
   1019069|00000000||Spare you in return for a favor.
   1019071|00000000||I'll spare you, but you gotta help me in return. I need you to assume someone's form - Caleb Menge's. I need you to sail to Temple Isle and--
   1019073|00000000||What? I'll not do it! I'd never do it! You might as well kill me now, save me the torture Menge would put me through.
   1019075|00000000||Fine… Never mind. Just stop stealing, or I'll torture you myself. Now get lost.
   1037399|00000000||Let him finish. There's no brothel involved.
   1046049|00000000||You see, friend, Geralt just hit the nail on the head. For what you have there is the old publicity placard.
   1046051|00000000||Old?
   1046053|00000000||Very. From a time when my establishment was under different management.
   1046055|00000000||I, however, would never let any indecency take place in my cabaret. My very reputation precludes it.
   1046057|00000000||So, what's all this about?
   1037401|00000000||You're betrothed is a first-class artiste, and I want to offer her a position worthy of her talents. She's to be my choreographer. And that, in turn, means she'll receive a share of the proceeds from every performance she… choreographs.
   1037405|00000000||You mean to say… coin?
   1037407|00000000||And fame. No flirting required. You have my word.
   1037409|00000000||Hmm… 'spose, in that case…
   1037417|00000000||I knew you'd agree!
   1037421|00000000||It's settled, then! See you at the Rosemary, Polly.
   1037358|00000000||Let Dandelion finish.
   1037289|00000000||Ask for a beating, get a beating.
   1037291|00000000||Asked nicely, but you just wouldn't listen. And I'm not the kind to give second chances.
   1037363|00000000||Stay outta this, freak, 'fore this ends with you gettin' your head smashed in.
   1037365|00000000||Gentlemen, please…
   1037367|00000000||There it is - one word too many.
   1037359|00000000||Had enough.
   1037312|00000000||My friend asked you nicely, so please be courteous in return and hear him out. Or we'll settle this another way.
   1046043|00000000||All right.Talk.
   1037318|00000000||Hubio, right? Polly's told me so much about you. She said you're erudite, and have an open mind.
   1046045|00000000||You said that?
   1046047|00000000||Well, there's a truth to it. My mind's the open sort… But its open-sortedness ends when my betrothed starts waggin' her arse around brothels!
   1046092|00000000||Get out of here, both of yous! Polly's not goin' anywhere!
   1037288|00000000||Let Dandelion explain, or I'll split your skull.
   1046033|00000000||Whoa! What the devil's this? Get outta my 'ouse!
   1037276|00000000||Watch it. And leave the woman alone.
   1037278|00000000||What the-?! She's my betrothed!
   1046035|00000000||But I'm not your property!
   1046038|00000000||I love her. I'll not let her sway her arse in 'is brothel!
   1037280|00000000||Whoa, slow down there a minute. This is clearly one gigantic misunderstanding. One I can clear up in the blink of an eye.
   1046041|00000000||Shove your excuses up your arse! Sod off, or I'll split your skull!
   1037698|00000000||Who's Rautlec, and what's with these placards?
   1037690|00000000||Who's Rautlec?
   1037692|00000000||Never heard of him? Hank Rautlec, famous portrait artist?
   1046311|00000000||Commissioned a portrait artist to paint your placards?
   1046313|00000000||Henri's an old friend, needed the coin.
   1037702|00000000||And I decided we needed new placards to promote the opening performance. Seats won't fill themselves, you know.
   1047696|00000000||Well, I'm off!
   1047698|00000000||I'll catch up to you.
   1046230|00000000||Phew, never expected that to go so well.
   1046243|00000000||Could've skipped all that talking if you'd left it to me.
   1046245|00000000||What, so you could smack him? Stopped to think how Polly'd react to that? Think she'd be thrilled? What if he smacked you back and won?
   1046247|00000000||He wouldn't've won.
   1046232|00000000||Would've been quicker if you'd left it to me.
   1046231|00000000||You handled it well.
   1046239|00000000||You handled it well, Dandelion. Man was putty in your hands once you called him erudite.
   1046241|00000000||In negotiation, as in combat, the key is to find your opponent's weak spot and exploit it to the hilt.
   1036770|00000000||Sorry dear, Geralt can get carried away at times and…
   1046252|00000000||You know, maybe it's for the best. I felt no pity, no remorse as I watched you brawl. Can't help but think it means I've no actual feelings for Hubio…
   1046254|00000000||You're not mad?
   1046256|00000000||No. Grateful. I believe I needed a shock not unlike that one to understand that what I had with Hubio… well, it wasn't working.
   1046258|00000000||I'm ready to try something new… I'd gladly start by choreographing your revue.
   1037753|00000000||Excellent! Then I'll see you at the Rosemary and Thyme!
   1046269|00000000||Hm, kind of expected her to get hysterical, fly into a rage.
   1046271|00000000||So did I. Merely goes to show just how much we have yet to learn about women…
   1046273|00000000||One of whom's waiting for you at the Rosemary.
   1046265|00000000||Funny, thought she'd be mad, too.
   1046298|00000000||We should get back to the Rosemary. Priscilla's probably worried.
   1046267|00000000||Back to the Rosemary.
   1046266|00000000||Smart girl.
   1046275|00000000||Hm, guess not all women go for arrogant pricks after all.
   1046297|00000000||One swallow does not a summer make.
   1036774|00000000||Ugh. Told you to let me do the talking.
   1036775|00000000||If I hadn't intervened, you'd be in my shoes right now.
   1036776|00000000||I beg to differ. Many a man's started out wanting to kill me, and ended up buying me a round.
   1046249|00000000||So, time to head back?
   1046296|00000000||I've still gotta stop by Rautlec's. Commissioned some new placards from him a while ago, but Hubio came across the old version. Ploughing artist's got some serious explaining to do!
   1037697|00000000||I'll get the placards. You head back to the Rosemary.
   1037700|00000000||I'll go see Rautlec, you head back to the Rosemary. Or Priscilla will have my head.
   1046323|00000000||Really? You'd go?
   1042902|00000000||No, said that for the hell of it. Tell me where he lives.
   1042904|00000000||Port-side.
   1046325|00000000||See you soon.
   1053163|00000000||Ruben, you've served in some wars, so tell us… Black Ones're sittin' across the Pontar, a stone's throw away. Why the bloody hell don't we attack?
   1053165|00000000||Cause we've gotten no such order.
   1053167|00000000||Not askin' you, mutton head. Ruben? What's Radovid waitin' for?
   1053169|00000000||For Nilfgaard to grow weak. Rumors abound: not all the Black Ones love their emperor, some plot's afoot to dislodge him.
   1053171|00000000||So if it's growin' hot in his breeches, why don't Emhyr attack us?
   1053173|00000000||He's waitin', too. Bugger knows half of our troops are mercenaries, and sooner or later we'll not have the wherewithal to pay 'em.
   1054305|00000000||On your way? Or will you stay longer? It's far safer with you around…
   1032923|00000000||Did you see the women who came off the ship?
   1032925|00000000||Dressed for a masquerade ball.
   1032927|00000000||They laughed at us. Perhaps to them we look to be wearing costumes.
   1032929|00000000||All because of this idiotic war. Women once knew how the ladies in Nilfgaard dressed, and now?
   1032931|00000000||You're right, my ladies. Falling behind the fashions - the greatest tragedy the war has wrought.
   1053897|00000000||Things really that bad in Velen?
   1053899|00000000||Saw young'uns there, fightin' over a bit o' flesh from a dead dog.
   1053901|00000000||Met a woman willin' to sell herself for a loaf o' bread.
   1053907|00000000||Heard the cackles of folk gone mad with fear.
   1053909|00000000||So, aye… it's that bad. Worse than anywhere in the world.
   1068289|00000000||Uh-oh, got a prisoner.
   1068358|00000000||Uh-oh. Got yourselves a prisoner.
   1068360|00000000||We don't take prisoners.
   1068395|00000000||Agh. We should go before a patrol comes along. Thank you, Geralt… Ever need any help, you know where to find me.
   1066284|00000000||Hard to argue with that.
   1068383|00000000||Roche is right. Besides, killing a defenseless--
   1068385|00000000||What is with you, Roche? Did the witcher take your stones? They're sadists! He's the occupier!
   1068387|00000000||I will explain later..
   1068389|00000000||You, Nilfgaardian. Piss off.
   1068391|00000000||{Mòran taing. N'ees dhearmad a va-- } [Thank you. I shall not forget you d--]
   1068393|00000000||Go, before I change my mind.
   1068372|00000000||Roche… Noble of you and all, but occasionally, I work for Nilfgaardians. Frankly, I don't want any trouble.
   1068374|00000000||I don't like this… But so be it, you certainly don't deserve to suffer as a result.
   1068376|00000000||Well said, Geralt. A good Black One's a dead Black One. I'll strangle the bug--
   1068378|00000000||Stand aside. I'll do this.
   1068380|00000000||{Neen... Tròcair!!! } [No… I beg you!]
   1066283|00000000||Kill him, Roche. I don't want any trouble.
   1068294|00000000||You took my weapon, Roche… So I must manage with my bare hands.
   1068361|00000000||Leave him alone. There are corpses enough here.
   1068363|00000000||What?!
   1068365|00000000||You heard me.
   1068367|00000000||I did and I can't believe it! He came here to murder civilians. He's seen us. Will you have him return to his camp and report?!
   1068370|00000000||Emhyr knows we can kill his men. Let him learn that we can also show mercy.
   1068291|00000000||One left.
   1068288|00000000||One left.
   1066229|00000000||Gods dammit, Ves! Have you gone completely mental?!
   1068271|00000000||You ignore my orders. Go off on a suicide mission. And instead of donning a breastplate, you dash into battle, shirt open, navel and whatnot exposed!
   1068273|00000000||You're not my father, Roche. You've no right to tell me what to wear.
   1068275|00000000||But I am your commander, and you will obey me! Guerilla warfare. Warfare! It involves armies, for fuck's sake!
   1068278|00000000||I could not abandon them. They helped us.
   1068280|00000000||It's a soldier's job to kill, Ves, not save, not rescue. If that is not to your liking, join the Sisters of Melitele, study to be a healer. Fucking hell…
   1068283|00000000||Give me your weapon. You'll get it back when you wise up - if you wise up. Move out!
   1068286|00000000||Akh akh akh… ptooey… akh!
   1068357|00000000||{Hvren…  } [Fuck...]
    384940|00000000||Nearly there, nearly there…
    474682|00000000||What is this place?
    474684|00000000||Shh… the Wolven Glade.
    391036|00000000||Nice name. White Wolf should feel right at home.
    391038|00000000||The White Wolf - aye, good balance, for terrible things happened here of yore.
    474686|00000000||To this day, none dare mention the name aloud.
    400438|00000000||All right, no reason to dawdle.
    487136|00000000||Prepare, and prepare well. Once the spirits appear, there'll be no recourse, no turning back.
    487138|00000000||Nothing like a little encouragement…
    400440|00000000||Light the fires. The pellar will treat that as his sign to begin.
    400416|00000000||Let's start.
    400418|00000000||The fires - why do we need them?
    400420|00000000||To keep malicious forces at bay. You must watch they do not go out! Or else, it shall come!
    400428|00000000||What'll come?
    400430|00000000||Evil.
    400412|00000000||Why do we need the fires?
    400414|00000000||What will you do?
    400432|00000000||What about you? What'll you do?
    400434|00000000||The pellar must clear the stone, then draw the signs.
    400436|00000000||Then to the gods shall the pellar pray, that no evil may take us.
    400409|00000000||Here. The place.
    400422|00000000||What now?
    400424|00000000||Light the fires.
    480504|00000000||Rode through here.
    481224|00000000||Their horse collapsed… Can't be far.
   1069093|00000000||Hm, looks like it might've started limping.
   1069091|00000000||Hoofprints.
   1069089|00000000||Prints're deep. Horse was carrying a heavy load…
   1054555|00000000||Oh, aye, somethin' o' the kind dashed by. Turned left, there.
   1056581|00000000||But 'twere a wench he were carryin', swear it on me 'ead. Squealin' and wailin' so…
   1054553|00000000||Anyone ride through here? Two men, one slung over the saddle like a sack?
    485612|00000000||Grab the bitch!
   1004192|00000000||He's the Bloody Baron. No stranger to blood sport. The kind his dad practiced on his mum.
   1004193|00000000||They ran away. Then maybe robbers attacked 'em?
   1004194|00000000||Or monsters. It'd be no wonder there's no footprints.
   1004195|00000000||Swallowed them whole, boots and all.
   1004196|00000000||Aye, necrophages think leather boots a delicacy!
   1033273|a23eb19b||Redanian Woman
    416092|103ab9ab||Bear
   1046333|00000000||The White Wolf must follow the pellar. The pellar will show the way.
   1046335|00000000||We got a long way to go?
   1046337|00000000||Nay, it's not far. Through the village, then the wood, and there we will be.
   1046347|00000000||The White Wolf must follow.
   1046349|00000000||Tis not far now.
   1046359|00000000||All this the baron's land?
   1046361|00000000||Tis now. 'Twere not before.
   1049461|00000000||So who'd it belong to?
   1049463|00000000||To the lord. Vserad they called him.
   1049465|00000000||An evil man he were. Vile, cared not a lick for common folk.
   1049467|00000000||You all get together and drive him away?
   1049469|00000000||When the Black Ones came, the lord to the tower on Fyke Isle fled.
   1049471|00000000||The invaders set the fields afire, and a great hunger descended on us all.
   1049473|00000000||While the lord in abundance wallowed, there in the Tower of Mice.
   1049475|00000000||But the old gods in their ire upon him visited a punishment.
   1049477|00000000||A plague of rodents swarmed the isle.
   1049479|00000000||At first they ate all from the feast tables. Then, the lord and all his court they devoured.
   1049484|00000000||Local gods just aren't known to be tolerant.
   1046384|00000000||Nilfgaardians hit you pretty hard.
   1049571|00000000||Folk're poor here. It's rare the mighty concern themselves with the poor.
   1049583|00000000||But the invaders'll be punished, that's sure.
   1049585|00000000||Perchance they've already been.
   1049587|00000000||How's that?
   1049589|00000000||A pestilence grips their camp and will devour them all. As the mice devoured the lord's court.
   1054333|00000000||There's our brave fighter! That one don't shirk from no monsters!
   1053182|00000000||Longer it lasts, worse it gets. Radovid was late with our pay a whole week.
   1053184|00000000||He's tryin' to cheat us, too. Purse I got was full o' counterfeit crowns. Lookie here… bronze with just a lick o' gold on it.
   1053186|00000000||Means the Redanian coffers are near empty.
   1053188|00000000||Might be time to cross the Pontar, see if there's any work for us there.
   1060226|00000000||I love you.
   1060228|00000000||Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town…
   1060230|00000000||Aaaaaargh!
   1060232|00000000||I'll tell you all.
   1060234|00000000||Darlin'!
    417687|00000000||A girl and plaited flowers.
    453509|00000000||Looks like a small shrine.
   1001196|00000000||Here it is! The line, c-cut!
   1001197|00000000||And some colorful powders… paprika, cinnamon, cloves. And wagon tracks. Must've thrown the loot in a spice wagon.
   1001199|00000000||Let's follow the ruts.
   1011341|00000000||Where's that scent coming from? Cinnamon. Strange.
   1018159|00000000||I don't smell a thing.
    583459|00000000||Same as the one tied to the bolt. Gonna have to look around…
    594566|00000000||Eh?
    594568|00000000||My man's a sword swinger, too. For King Radovid.
    594570|00000000||Is it not uncomfortable? All that steel on your back?
    492749|00000000||Mum, look what I found!
    491761|00000000||That's a perty necklace! Where'd you get it?
    491762|00000000||Was lyin' in the street. So I took it.
    491763|00000000||You look me straight in the eyes and lie, just like your pa. You're a good lad.
    492754|00000000||Now go play. Mummy's got to get some sleep 'fore she goes to work.
    466472|00000000||Fuck off, or I'll mess you up.
    466474|00000000||Piss off… before I kick your asses.
    466476|00000000||We'll see who kicks whose arse! Get 'im, lads! Pound 'is gob!
    466478|00000000||Let the woman go. Then we can flirt.
    466480|00000000||Look at that - vagrant mutt's givin' us orders… Needs to know his place! Fuck 'im up!
    466470|00000000||Let her go, first.
    466448|00000000||Leave her alone.
    466450|00000000||Why's that? Want us to plough you, is that it? Doable, but you'll have to hide that mug in a sack!
    513033|00000000||Go away.
   1001138|00000000||Sit!
   1001141|00000000||Stay!
   1001143|00000000||Lie down.
   1001144|00000000||Scratch!
   1001146|00000000||Hmpf, nothing extraordinary about it…
   1001147|00000000||Lovely pups, indeed.
   1001135|00000000||I know this might sound immodest, but our hunting hounds are simply the best.
   1001136|00000000||They do seem fierce…
   1001137|00000000||Yes, but they're superbly trained. Won't even whimper without my permission.
    423098|00000000||Kingfisher. Where'd you get the name?
    423100|00000000||Master Dandelion's poetry! "The kingfisher preened, then fell in the latrine..." Know it?
    498400|00000000||Yeah. Also know the one about "Princess Annie, who drowned in the river Fannee."
    498402|00000000||Ahem… yes... At any rate, the Kingfisher welcomes poetry lovers with open arms. Some of the brightest stars in the literary firmament perform here.
    423104|00000000||See you later.
    359642|00000000||Farewell.
    359634|00000000||Show me what you're peddling.
    359644|00000000||What're you serving today?
    423102|00000000||How can I be of service?
    434803|00000000||Whoa, whoa! This here's a toll crossin'.
    467666|00000000||By what right?
    467668|00000000||By the right of a prick up your backside, wisearse! Pay up or start fuckin' swimmin'!
   1028727|00000000||Lemme through.
   1028728|00000000||Right, move on. Road's open.
   1028725|00000000||Lemme pass.
    434807|00000000||I'll cross - but I'm not gonna pay you a broken copper.
    434809|00000000||Broken's what your jaw'll be once our clubs're done with it! Votmir, have at the thrifty fucker!
    434791|00000000||Not about to give you a copper.
    434789|00000000||Fine, I'll pay.
    434805|00000000||Fine… I'll pay.
    467670|00000000||Bit of a shame, that. Would've liked the practice… But coin's not bad either. Ride on!
   1052680|00000000||I tell you, this city'll devour itself.
   1052682|00000000||What's this tripe now, Frank?
   1052684|00000000||It's not tripe, it's wisdom. Folk keep building, but room is limited. The Pontar on one side, the sea on the other… Not long now and we'll be building houses atop others.
   1052686|00000000||Unless Emhyr comes to reduce the place to rubble.
   1052688|00000000||Oh, yes… We'll have plenty of space to build, then.
    480809|00000000||I take it you're in Novigrad on important business?
    480810|00000000||Important doesn't do it justice. I'm looking for someone.
    495339|00000000||More precisely?
    495341|00000000||Young woman who's like a daughter to me.
    489718|00000000||Her?! Here?! No. Impossible.
    489720|00000000||She was here - there're witnesses, evidence. Was hoping you'd heard something.
    489723|00000000||You've been here a while - I need you to help me find something, anything, a trace.
    489725|00000000||I'll do everything I can, of course. Who might know more?
   1063307|00000000||Nice to hear a few kind words, but my friend needs his weapons.
   1063309|00000000||Course, I got 'em. Said I'd have 'em, give 'em back, so I'm givin' 'em back.
   1046026|00000000||Here's your junk.
   1046028|00000000||Thanks.
   1063311|00000000||You watch out for yourself, miss… Novigrad's not what it used to be, not a city for you.
   1062780|00000000||Madame sorceress, beautiful as ever. Damn shame to part.
   1062782|00000000||Don't fret, bound to be back soon.
    472745|0ead2ac8||Barmaid
   1032646|00000000||Locked, but looks like Zed's inside… and in hot water.
   1032647|00000000||Gotta find another way in.
   1066171|00000000||It's the village below. Black with Nilfgaardians already. They're preparing to execute folk.
   1068201|00000000||No sign of Ves.
   1068650|00000000||She may be impetuous, but she's not stupid. She's waiting for her moment. Probably attack after dusk, once--
   1068204|00000000||Shht.
   1068206|00000000||What now?
   1068209|00000000||A trio. Lightly equipped. Sneaking closer. Over there, near the--
   1068212|00000000||Death to the Black Ones!
   1068214|00000000||{Aep me! Cyrche! } [To me! They're attacking!]
   1068216|00000000||Looks like we're too late.
   1068220|00000000||Idiot! Geralt, we have to help. Follow me!!
   1029732|00000000||Awful weather… Good thing we'll leave soon.
   1029734|00000000||Appalling manners!
   1029736|00000000||You try returning by sea, what with those accursed pirates…
   1029744|00000000||They near refused to let us cross the Pontar, yet they let this sort right in. Pff. Scandalous.
   1029738|00000000||You--! You boor!
   1029740|00000000||What're you…? What on earth are you doing?!
   1029742|00000000||Nooo!
    447025|00000000||What's more, the whoresons steal young 'uns!
    447031|00000000||Yes, steal them! And subject them to vile torture till the babes transform unto beasts wretched as themselves!
    447033|00000000||And every so often a wyvern will eat a nekker, but does that make it good?
    447027|00000000||Well, he ain't easy on the eyes, but he do kill monsters, don't he?
    447023|00000000||Ah, here crawls a witcher! Look! The corpse-like visage! The beastly eyes! This is magic that's made a mongrel of a man!
    490515|00000000||Now just to hide… and wait..
   1065400|00000000||Behind the door… Best place to hide. Classic.
   1065402|00000000||Blind man would even spot me here…
   1063338|00000000||There it is. Seems I'm in for a swim.
    474431|00000000||There's the shrine. Passage must be somewhere around here.
   1010141|00000000||Ceadmil.
   1010139|00000000||Welcome.
   1010137|00000000||Ceadmil, Gwynbleidd.
   1010135|00000000||Hmm...
   1010133|00000000||Scandalous!
   1010131|00000000||Save yourselves!
    581617|00000000||They're headed for the square! After them!
    581619|00000000||Guards! Guards!
   1075655|00000000||Dandelion!
    581621|00000000||Ciri!
    581623|00000000||Ciri…
   1077548|00000000||Dammit!
   1075657|00000000||Arrest that man!
    462934|00000000||Last time I say this… Either come with me, or not at all.
    462930|00000000||Enough. Kill 'im!
    462932|00000000||Thought I was clear… No wanderin'.
   1004861|00000000||When I were in Novigrad…
   1004862|00000000||Novigrad? You've not poked your nose out of the village…
   1004863|00000000||Me father took me once!
   1004864|00000000||Probably to sell you to a beggar, but none was interested.
    481105|00000000||You stink of dead men. Get out.
    481106|00000000||One round, you said… and that were it! Now sod off.
   1046539|00000000||If it's human speech you don't understand, I'll explain it with iron, you bastard.
    516890|00000000||The witcher defeated Olaf - champion of all Skellige for years! No one could best him, 'cause the whoreson feeds on man flesh!
    516966|00000000||Let's start.
    516967|00000000||All right, come to daddy.
    516892|00000000||Let's fight.
    516895|00000000||Don't feel like fighting right now.
    516894|00000000||Farewell.
    516893|00000000||What would the baron think?
    516954|00000000||Business seems good, even with the baron gone.
    540470|00000000||Life's short, but art's eternal.
    516942|00000000||Baron's gone, but seems business is booming.
    540454|00000000||Folk're more eager than ever to see the men go at it.
    516939|00000000||The baron know this is how his men amuse themselves?
    516940|00000000||Baron knows all about it. Even bets on the fights sometimes.
    516941|00000000||Bets like a dumb fuck. Always loses.
    516889|00000000||This here witcher defeated the Novigrad champion, the terrible elf known as the Tailor!
    516891|00000000||The witcher is champion of Novigrad and Skellige! Will our sergeant break his winning streak?
    516887|00000000||I'm ready.
    516888|00000000||Hah! Look who we have here!
   1075459|00000000||It's not the time for brawls, now. Come back another day.
   1075486|00000000||See the flames? What're you thinkin'? There's no fightin' now!.
   1004820|00000000||Say what you will, but his lass was different.
   1004821|00000000||She'd bring nourishment anytime one of us fell ill… Always helpful.
   1004822|00000000||Maybe he got angry, killed her, buried her in the woods?
   1004823|00000000||Or it were one of his bandits?
   1037310|00000000||You're back! So? Got the acid?
   1031456|00000000||Mhm. Use it carefully. It's about as caustic as things come.
   1031457|00000000||I know. It's burned many a man where I come from.
   1037322|00000000||Armor's ready, now for the last touch. We'll soon see who's better - Fergus or me.
   1053605|00000000||The Passiflora's Novigrad's most famous bordello. But there's also Crippled Kate's, the Rosemary… and the streetwalkers, naturally.
   1053610|00000000||What say the priests to all this? Such debauchery in the light of the Eternal Fire, right under their noses - they're not bothered?
   1053612|00000000||Officially, they're tremendously bothered. Unofficially… They drop in themselves - not to save wayward maidens.
    520132|00000000||They were looking for something…
   1032076|00000000||And when I came to, I realized I'd just left the Vivaldis' bank penniless!
   1032077|00000000||Mind-control, spell-castin'. What sorcery's this?
   1032074|00000000||To destroy my whole stock of mead I toiled to bring from Skellige?
   1032075|00000000||Skellige mead? They've no gods in their hearts!
   1032072|00000000||...all my coin, the deal of a lifetime, all cocked up…
   1032073|00000000||Not like I care, mate. Now sod off!
   1049232|00000000||Gods, why? Why?!
   1049234|00000000||Me treasure, me crumb…
   1049237|00000000||Who had she wronged…?
   1049239|00000000||Gods… Give her back!
   1054580|00000000||Leg it!
   1054582|00000000||Not another drubbin'! We're leavin'!
   1054586|00000000||Told you this place was no good. Told you, didn't I?
   1054584|00000000||Ploughin' freaks. Ptoo!
    173713|00000000||*Sniffs* Ugh. Sure wasn't lavender they kept in there. Might be worth looking around, though.
    500844|00000000||What ails you?
    499132|00000000||Can't see outta one eye, m'lord.
    499133|00000000||Icht'am'Azrain.
    499134|00000000||Thank you, m'lord. A right miracle you've worked. I'd like to repay you.
    499135|00000000||Convince those knaves on the City Council that spells are not needed on a whim, but positively indispensable.
    499136|00000000||They won't listen, m'lord. They's scared o' Menge.
    499137|00000000||In that case please convey that if any of them should fall ill, he can stick his head in the flames of the Eternal Fire.
    499138|00000000||Now permit me some rest.
    490234|00000000||We'll manage this. I'm sure.
    490243|00000000||Cheer up. We can manage this, I'm certain.
    490269|00000000||Famous last words, right there.
    490235|00000000||Pull yourself together.
    490271|00000000||Get a grip, Dandelion. We must focus on the task at hand.
    490273|00000000||I'm just saying…
    490275|00000000||Well then be silent.
    490262|00000000||Have you learned where Whoreson is keeping Dudu?
    490264|00000000||Room on the top floor. One with the balcony.
    490266|00000000||I'll need to cross onto the roof. Wait for me in front of Junior's house. And I know it's difficult, but do try to look inconspicuous.
    489410|00000000||If they… If they hurt you… Whoreson will pay.
    490237|00000000||I'll go in alone, you know. You'll stay outside.
    490239|00000000||I can't let you go alone. Anything happens to you, Geralt'll rip my head off!
    490241|00000000||Someone must secure our retreat. There's bound to be a struggle, things could get intense. We'll need to flee fast, disappear in the crowd.
    490233|00000000||I'll go in alone, you know.
    489393|00000000||Got a bad feeling about this…
    490230|00000000||Calm down, Dandelion. We can't leave Dudu in Whoreson Junior's hands, you know that.
    490232|00000000||I know, I know. But my gut can't be reasoned with, and no amount of sympathy I feel can silence it, blot it out.
   1053883|00000000||I heard about Leslav… Will ye need any help with the funeral?
   1053885|00000000||Won't be no funeral. Gonna burn the body, scatter the ashes.
   1053887|00000000||You're what..? 'Tain't fittin'! Ye gotta put him in the ground, near his forebears!
   1053889|00000000||Have ye not heard what goes on at the cemetery? Soon as they bury one, a monster comes out o' the woods, drags the body off.
   1053891|00000000||I'll throw me son in the fire. I will not give him up to some devil to be devoured.
   1004295|00000000||Told you not to gaze in the well, Yanna!
   1004296|00000000||All right, gran.
   1004297|00000000||Your face could catch some vodnik's eye.
   1004298|00000000||And your ma don't have coin for a witcher.
    355685|00000000||You sure?
    355687|00000000||I beg ye... Do it quick.
    409155|00000000||Then burn my remains.
    355689|00000000||All right.
    409161|00000000||Thank ye. Take this. Thought I'd leave some coin for me young 'uns… but they've no need of it now.
    355681|00000000||I'll do it.
    355691|00000000||Sorry. Can't do that.
    355693|00000000||I beg ye…
    409187|00000000||No.
    409189|00000000||No? Why the hell not? You disgusted? Afeared of your conscience? Gods dammit, do it quick - I'll pay ye.
    468694|00000000||If you won't… get out o' my sight. Let me die in peace.
    355683|00000000||Not about to kill you.
    409141|00000000||Looking for ghouls? Why?
    409090|00000000||No one else to do me in. Been in a bad way for days, final breaths, like… but somehow can't die. So strong since I were a lad, dammit…
    409092|00000000||Hmm… We met before?
    409094|00000000||Aye. You pulled me from under a pile o' stiffs. I was sure the scourge'd never touch me. So sure, so foolish…
    409118|00000000||Listen. You did me a kindness once, do me another. Got a sharp sword there. Finish this.
   1031736|00000000||Does this look to you like armor that stops bolts?
   1034364|00000000||Compensate the man.
   1034367|00000000||Now. Let us see what this other suit is worth.
    426902|00000000||Not interested.
    426906|00000000||Maybe another time.
    426908|00000000||You ought to try. Few get the honor to play with the owner and his closest associates.
    440386|00000000||Refuse and someone could feel shunned, insulted even.
    426914|00000000||I'm not greedy. I've won enough, thanks.
    426916|00000000||You misunderstand. This is not a request.
    456056|00000000||Take him upstairs!
    426910|00000000||Not going anywhere.
    426912|00000000||All right.
    426898|00000000||If that's the case, I accept the invitation.
    426900|00000000||Come with me.
    426904|00000000||Sounds interesting.
    367175|00000000||Getting good hands.
    370163|00000000||Luck of the draw, today.
    370165|00000000||You might make better use of that luck, then.
    456036|00000000||We've a room for specially selected upstairs. Really big stakes there.
    424951|00000000||This is the place. Good luck.
    558625|00000000||Ye who wander on the gale,
    561852|00000000||Ever caught in this world's thrall,
    561854|00000000||See this sign, gentle, pale,
    568179|00000000||Ye we summon! Ye we call!
    561856|00000000||Ye we summon! Ye we call!
   1076849|00000000||Few even think to help elves in these times. I'd be amiss not to reward you, vatt'ghern. Find me in the camp nearby. I shall have something for you.
    501542|00000000||Thank you! If you hadn't intervened, they would have killed me. And Louisa, and the boy… I tremble at the thought.
    501543|00000000||Triss Merigold. Find her. Might be able to help you.
    501544|00000000||I hope so. Take this. I must abandon magic for good. You might still find use for it. Perhaps the next time you encounter mage hunters…
    501545|00000000||Yeah… Something tells me it won't be long… Farewell.
   1044539|00000000||Got a meeting with Rosa, a fencing lesson.
   1044541|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, yes? Miss Rosa stepped out for a walk. Near Temple Bridge, she said. She asked that you join her.
   1044543|00000000||Guess it's gonna be an interesting lesson. Thanks.
    531684|00000000||Due to meet Rosa.
    531692|00000000||Farewell.
    531685|00000000||Farewell
    531683|00000000||Greetings. You here for a specific reason?
   1032946|00000000||I'd like to buy my wife a Nilfgaardian shawl.
   1032948|00000000||I have none.
   1032950|00000000||What? But they're all the rage now.
   1032952|00000000||I carry no goods from Nilfgaard. They say Radovid doesn't look kindly upon it.
   1032954|00000000||And what's Radovid to do with Novigrad? We are an independent city.
   1032957|00000000||Not for long, they say…
   1028759|00000000||Not hungry, not thirsty, but I sure wouldn't mind a round of gwent.
   1028758|00000000||Cards?
    422021|00000000||Farewell.
    422017|00000000||Farewell.
    422015|00000000||Show me what you got.
    422019|00000000||What're you serving?
    422013|00000000||What'll it be?
   1051178|00000000||No beast to speak of in the woods. Just elves from a Scoia'tael band that attacked the convoys. Here… their squirrel tails.
   1051180|00000000||Scoia'tael, you say? And I thought we'd exterminated the last of those vermin. And the nonhumans left had wised up. Well, seems we'll need to pacify 'em again. Make a list of all the long-ears around, hang every tenth one… that should do it.
   1051182|00000000||Yeah. Definitely.
   1051184|00000000||I see we're of a mind on this. You're a good man. Here, the gold I promised you… and the pass. Good luck.
    470587|00000000||There's no beast in the woods. Just Scoia'tael.
    470589|00000000||Scoia'tael, you say? Thought we'd rid ourselves of those vermin. So, you gut them?
   1019676|00000000||Elves aren't monsters, so no… But I won't cry if anything happens to them.
   1051176|00000000||Hah, 'course you won't. A good nonhuman's a dead nonhuman, as my father would say. Can't give you no reward, you didn't do the job… but here's the pass I promised. For informing the proper authorities. We'll make quick work o' them.
    470583|00000000||No monster in the woods. Just Scoia'tael.
    470595|00000000||No. Searched the woods, didn't find a thing. Might've moved on.
    470597|00000000||That or you're one shite witcher… What're you still doing here? You'll not get any coin - just a kick in the arse, if you're lucky. Get lost!
    470585|00000000||No. Didn't find anything.
    462956|00000000||You're back, finally. Did you get the beast?
   1053790|00000000||{Uhwyr nevydd aen'en reigmeide en Byways encerdalad? } [Any word of the patrol that went to Byways?]
   1053792|00000000||{Neen. Yn ess'voolaen so va'ess que slecht. } [No. And something tells me when we get it, it will be bad.]
   1053794|00000000||{Esse'iare a va. } [We should send a search party.]
   1053796|00000000||{Ceanndant ess'voerboten. Esse'diccet o colled rheagor gverin. } [The commander forbids it. He said we cannot risk losing more men.]
   1053798|00000000||{Yn lle rhive en gvobr. Aure am gvybode aep reigmeid. } [Instead, he has posted a bounty. Gold for information about the patrol.]
   1053800|00000000||{Esse’gràin bloede moeras... Mire, n'esse creasa aep caer. } [I hate these bloody swamps… You will see, not one of us will return home alive.]
    512466|00000000||Look below!
    512467|00000000||A snitch - and traitor! See how he fights!
    512468|00000000||Disappointing…
    512469|00000000||But the day's not over yet!
   1034765|00000000||Yoana's the artisan, not Fergus.
   1034770|00000000||General, Yoana's the master artisan, not Fergus. She crafted this armor to prove it.
   1031481|00000000||Sorry, can't help.
   1031521|00000000||Got you your acid, but that's where I draw the line. Not about to risk my life again.
   1037224|00000000||Please. If you don't, I'll never prove I'm the master artisan, and that Fergus is nothing but a fraud.
   1037240|00000000||Sorry, can't help you.
   1031522|00000000||So, no volunteers? As I thought. The farce has ended, at last.
   1034848|00000000||How much for the armor?
   1034850|00000000||Well, it's just as I said…
   1031523|00000000||So, that's that. Shame you refused to trust me. Fergus… the midget's an amateur, and I made a beautiful suit of armor. Not my first, either…
   1034857|00000000||Naught left for me here. Maybe I'll have better luck elsewhere. Farewell.
   1037238|00000000||Sorry. Farewell.
   1037237|00000000||All right, I'll help.
   1031510|00000000||Fine. Hope I won't regret this…
   1031511|00000000||Don your armor, both. I will await outside.
   1031480|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
   1034824|00000000||About the test.
   1034825|00000000||I wanna know more about the test.
   1034827|00000000||I ordered armor that would stop bolts - how do you think I intend to test it?
   1034835|00000000||Geralt, you've nothing to worry about. This armor will easily withstand a bolt. Acid-hardened, they'd need a ballista to pierce it. Help me, please.
   1034783|00000000||For gods' sake, Yoana… What do you think you're doin'?
   1034787|00000000||Temeria remains a wild land, it seems. Insubordination of this kind is not something we Nilfgaardians allow.
   1034791|00000000||If I may, general. I am Fergus' subordinate in appearance alone. It's what we agreed, as few would ever believe a woman to be a better armorer than a dwarf.
   1034793|00000000||You are right. I, for one, do not think it possible. But you are confident in your abilities. Let us put them to the test. Not on dummies. In live combat.
   1034811|00000000||Ho, ho, quite a crowd.
   1034804|00000000||You there. Put on this armor.
   1034806|00000000||Err… I'm just here to shoe me horse…
   1034808|00000000||Mine is not a request.
   1034813|00000000||General, I crafted this armor for a man. It can't fit me properly.
   1034815|00000000||Then find another to wear it.
   1034816|00000000||Geralt? Will you help?
   1034766|00000000||Exactly what it looks like. Yoana crafted a suit of armor for you, general. To prove she's the superior armorer.
   1034764|00000000||Yoana made her own suit of armor. It's better.
   1034748|00000000||Geralt! It's done.
   1034750|00000000||Looks… very professional.
   1034375|00000000||Welcome, general. Armor's all ready. Came out splendid, if I do say so myself.
   1031463|00000000||Rather coarse. I trust the appearance does not reflect the quality.
   1034759|00000000||General, I've also made a suit. If you please…
   1034763|00000000||What is the meaning of this?
   1068545|f9e02e89||Bayor
   1074072|00000000||Good luck to you. Save Gran, please. Got me fingers crossed.
   1061967|00000000||Looks like a good spot…
   1061969|00000000||A master monster slayer in the world's largest city… looking for rat shit… Sheesh.
   1061971|00000000||Last piece of incense. Good thing, stuff really stinks.
    549185|00000000||None shall pass.
    549184|00000000||Halt!
    594548|00000000||Go in health.
    594550|00000000||Every man for himself.
    594552|00000000||Everyone's always "I, me, mine." Selfish twats.
    496530|00000000||You have bandages at home? Some spirit? He laid a claw or two on me, unfortunately.
    496531|00000000||I-I've naught, miss… but my lord - he's a powerful man. He's sure to help ye.
    496536|00000000||Might even reward you for cuttin' the werewolf down.
    496538|00000000||Very well. Lead us to your lord.
    496516|00000000||We must get to the village.
    496517|00000000||We found a corpse in the woods.
    496519|00000000||You're lucky we came this way. Found someone far less fortunate in the forest.
    496521|00000000||Oh, Yaren, must be. We was returnin' from Midcopse when the brute attacked. I managed to flee, but Yaren, er…
    496523|00000000||The little one - no details.
    495951|00000000||Why… you really gave 'im a drubbin'! Never seen anythin' like it!
    495952|00000000||Girl! You can come out now! Come on!
   1017577|00000000||If not for the witcher, where'd we be?
   1017579|00000000||You'd still be ruttin' in mud, ploughin' gorgin' on acorns…
   1017581|00000000||I knows it, I know. We've the gods to thank for that master witcher, we do!
    480905|00000000||Dammit! By a hair!
    480906|00000000||See that? Not nearly as haggard as you think me!
    486981|00000000||Congratulations.
    486983|00000000||Unnecessary. Better you bid your sword farewell. I await my reward!
    480907|00000000||What?
    486986|00000000||Another chance to win.
    480903|00000000||You're wind, not woman!
    486972|00000000||Worthy of the best horse! The mare is yours!
    486989|00000000||Thank you!
    505681|00000000||Haha-hahahaah!
    505691|00000000||Aaaaa!
   1003832|00000000||You crook, you thief! You're filth from under Hemdall's ball sack!
   1007577|00000000||Ah, troll bugger you blind!
   1003833|00000000||I want me coin back, ye slag!
   1007580|00000000||Tell that to your mother!
   1020769|00000000||It's a trap! Fall back!
   1022570|00000000||Protect the king!
   1004226|00000000||Where'd you get the silver?
   1004227|00000000||Merchants were at Crow's Perch. Cost me a cockerel and a piece of griffin hide.
   1004228|00000000||Sweet mother! That's a fortune!
   1004229|00000000||You saw what's left of Heatherton?
   1004230|00000000||Silver arrowheads - that's what I'll have waitin' for the Hunt when it shows again.
   1010815|00000000||We must leave the city at once. Is everything ready?
    584237|61af3c4e||Traveler
    503555|00000000||Riders ready?!
    407531|00000000||Why do you wanna fight me?
    422442|00000000||Hm, why're you challenging me? Don't recall doing anything to offend the Maid Bilberry.
    407537|00000000||Well… Why… Uhm… Then swear - swear Maid Bilberry's the most loveliest of all!
    422444|00000000||Thing is, I've never laid eyes on her.
    422446|00000000||Ahah! Ahh! I shall wash your scorn away with thy blood, fiend! Stand and fight!
    407533|00000000||At your service. Let's get this over with.
    407529|00000000||All right, let's do this.
    422290|00000000||Halt! Stand and duel! I challenge you!
    407521|00000000||Boots a bit big, maybe? Careful not to trip.
    407523|00000000||Halt, I say! I am Ronvid of the Small Marsh, bound by a sacred oath…
    407525|00000000||Ooh, that's rough. My sympathies.
    407527|00000000||… to honor Maid Bilberry, fairest of all maids I know, by dueling a hundred knights to the death. Now draw your sword posthaste, for I've ninety-nine left after you.
    591235|00000000||I've a bad feeling about this…
   1040684|00000000||Zireael not recognized. Intruders. Destroy the intruders.
   1042051|00000000||Teleport over there.
   1042063|00000000||We must activate it quickly. I've a feeling another golem's about to surprise us.
   1042057|00000000||Another swallow…
    591233|00000000||Look, it worked.
    559833|00000000||Come on.
   1040150|00000000||How many sentries can he have?! This elf must be utterly paranoid!
   1052187|00000000||It's grown awfully quiet.
   1052189|00000000||Is that bad?
   1053352|00000000||A bit like the calm before a storm…
   1061541|00000000||Once you finally find Ciri, what will you do? Any plans?
   1061543|00000000||Depends what she wants.
   1061545|00000000||Imagined it - how it will… transpire? What will she say? What will she look like?
   1061922|00000000||No.
   1061928|00000000||I'm sorry. For getting ahead of myself. At times I forget…
   1061935|00000000||… we hardly know each other, certainly not enough to discuss personal matters.
   1061937|00000000||Not to worry. We'll get there.
   1061534|00000000||And that would be that! I knew we'd manage.
   1061536|00000000||That so? Make sure and tell me beforehand next time.
   1061930|00000000||My intuition's a fine instrument, witcher. Don't underestimate it.
   1061932|00000000||I've some veeery good feelings about you, for instance. In several domains.
   1061548|00000000||Uh-oh.
   1061550|00000000||What? Got that feeling again?
   1061943|00000000||And more…
    572431|00000000||Murder… Everyone saw it!
    572432|00000000||They came for me. And for you.
    505739|00000000||But I paid in advance, the entire month.
    505741|00000000||You did… But you paid the old price. The risks are greater now, and so should the rewards be.
   1084926|cf7152db||Armorer
    590678|00000000||Goddamn fools.
    590755|00000000||Shoddily armed for assassins.
    593882|00000000||These're just scouts. Came to see if Louis was telling the truth. Rest must be waiting nearby.
    593884|00000000||And your old pal probably knows where.
    593886|00000000||He was the only one knew I'd be here. Must've told them. Think me and him are due for a little chat…
    579110|00000000||Good luck.
    579111|00000000||In that case - good luck.
    579112|00000000||Wanna come with? Sight of two witchers might loosen his tongue quicker.
    593951|00000000||Besides, we haven't seen each other in ages. You could tell me what's new in the world…
    594048|00000000||Maybe next time, Letho. Got something else to take care of now.
    594050|00000000||Sure. So long, Wolf. Nice seeing you.
    594052|00000000||Same. Don't get killed.
    593953|00000000||Some other time, maybe. See you.
    593952|00000000||Why not. All right, I'll go with you.
    593967|00000000||Put it that way… All right, I'd love to come.
    594043|00000000||Stay close to me. It's one of those places that's hard to find if you don't know where to look.
    579113|00000000||Hmm, could be interesting. Love to see it.
    593893|00000000||Come along. Sight of two witchers should loosen his tongue that much quicker.
    579109|00000000||Love to see that.
   1046303|00000000||You're lookin' weak. Ye feel sickly?
   1046305|00000000||Been havin' bad dreams. Me brother, comin' back in me nightmares…
   1046307|00000000||But how am I to bury him when I don't know where the Black Ones did the whole lot in? He's somewhere in the woods, no doubt in a mass grave…
   1046309|00000000||When the pellar holds Forefathers' Eve, you can beg 'im for forgiveness.
    498507|00000000||You an artist? A sword swallower?
    498509|00000000||No. A witcher.
    498511|00000000||Hm, never heard of that.
   1028761|00000000||In the mood for some diversion. A game of gwent'd be best.
   1028760|00000000||How about a card game?
    422037|00000000||Farewell.
    422033|00000000||Farewell.
    422031|00000000||What're you offering?
    422035|00000000||What'd the cook make today?
    498480|00000000||Hello, there! Welcome!
    422029|00000000||Welcome to the Chameleon. We get all sorts here, so you're sure to fit right in!
    564298|00000000||Keep your eyes open.
    564299|00000000||Think they're really here?
    595198|00000000||Don't know. But like I said, I've grown real careful.
    406270|00000000||Keira's up to something. Better see what it is.
   1050668|00000000||A light… Top floor of the tower.
    526376|00000000||Expecting visitors?
    526380|00000000||Got company. Who is it?
    471983|00000000||Care for a drink?
    472028|00000000||How about I buy everybody a round?
    472783|00000000||Why would you?
    474629|00000000||Got the coin for it, simple as that.
    472030|00000000||I don't drink with strangers.
    472789|00000000||We share a round, won't be strangers anymore. Then we go our separate ways.
    474631|00000000||And which way might yours be?
    472054|00000000||Cheers.
    474587|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    474593|00000000||I'm a witcher.
    493939|00000000||Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other - for humans.
    493941|00000000||Only got one prick, though. In case you're wondering about that, too.
    474596|00000000||Don't touch 'im. Don't even look at 'im. Worse than lepers, that lot.
    474598|00000000||Saw one in action once. Killed a half dozen, blood everywhere - freak didn't even show a drop of sweat.
    474600|00000000||Got the stench o' corpses on 'im.
    473690|00000000||If you wanna rest, come with me. I've a bench you can use.
    472064|00000000||To your health. And mine.
    472066|00000000||Bottoms up.
   1063637|00000000||Cheers, then.
   1063638|00000000||Who's this baron?
   1063640|00000000||A baron holds these lands? Must be quite a man - doesn't seem to care a lick about all the imperials here. More and more arriving, too.
   1063642|00000000||Bloody Baron's not some poncey prick son of a rich lord. So no - he's not like to piss his britches at the sight of a black-winged head.
   1063644|00000000||This is interesting stuff.
   1063646|00000000||Our baron's baron 'cause that's the way we want it. And if that strikes anyone as wrong, well, we encourage 'em to speak their mind.
    474678|00000000||Like to know who I'm drinking with - just like you.
    474680|00000000||We're the baron's men. And you're in his land.
    474674|00000000||Like to know who I'm drinking with.
    472060|00000000||Just curious. Kinda wondering what you're doing here.
    472062|00000000||I don't like curious types.
    474670|00000000||Really. How badly?
    474672|00000000||So bad that I kill 'em.
    474676|00000000||Wonder what you're doing here.
    472056|00000000||Who are you?
    474633|00000000||Oh, aye - an' why do you care?
    472050|00000000||Who are you?
    474651|00000000||On my way to Novigrad.
    474653|00000000||City of whores and whoremongers.
    474639|00000000||Heading to Novigrad.
    474637|00000000||Not your concern.
    474641|00000000||Is it just me, or is that none of your fucking business?
    474643|00000000||I must be hearing things.
    474645|00000000||You ain't. He meant to insult.
    474649|00000000||I'll have to kill 'im, then.
    471985|00000000||Someone who'd prefer not to be bothered while he's having a drink.
    471987|00000000||Heh! Hear that? We've a distinguished gentleman in our midst!
    474591|00000000||Shine your boots, guv'nor?
    471989|00000000||No. Wouldn't want the grime on your hands to rub off on them.
    472024|00000000||Bolo… did you hear what I heard?
    476195|00000000||Go away. Or I'll kill you.
    476197|00000000||Dammit. Enough!
    471981|00000000||Back off or die.
    471973|00000000||Innkeep! Vodka!
    474579|00000000||Who's this 'un?
    471979|00000000||Brave warrior, looks like. Got two swords, see?
    474582|00000000||Oi, gray boy! What's the point of havin' two swords?
    476188|00000000||Wonder if he keeps an extra prick in his trousers, too.
    476190|00000000||You fuckin' deaf?
    474585|00000000||Gonna say who you are, or do I need to loosen your tongue with me knife?
    526378|00000000||Haven't finished my drink yet.
    526375|00000000||Haven't finished my drink.
    474520|00000000||You gotta go! I'll open the back way for ye!
    472986|00000000||Looking for a man. Goes by Hendrik.
    472988|00000000||What you want with 'im?
    472990|00000000||Wanna talk to him.
    473411|00000000||What about?
    471904|00000000||Gimme a bottle of something strong.
    372185|00000000||Many strangers come through here?
    372187|00000000||I'll not prattle about other folk. Suppose you're a tongue wagger - it'll only bring me grief.
    408063|00000000||I wanna know about travelers, not locals.
    408065|00000000||They come, they go… I don't want trouble - with locals or travelers.
    372177|00000000||Many strangers come through?
    372179|00000000||Food that scarce?
    372181|00000000||Food's gotten scarce.
    372183|00000000||Folk venture into the fields before sunup to catch frogs, gather acorns, grind'm into flour. Whosoever's got a hen don't sleep nights so he can watch his bird.
    410357|00000000||Can't your dogs do that?
    410359|00000000||One night a few weeks back, Temerian guerillas crept from the forest. They snuck 'tween the huts, clubs in hand.
    410361|00000000||Dogs bayed and barked, then howled and yelped, and then fell silent as the grave. That rabble then gathered near the old pits. I saw 'em - built fires, salted the meat…
    472703|00000000||Only the wildest of hounds about now, the kind that don't come near men. Except when hunger drives them to attack, that is.
    372157|00000000||Nothing on the spit.
    372159|00000000||We've naught to eat, that's certain.
    372137|00000000||Anything to eat?
    372189|00000000||Who rules these lands now? Nilfgaard?
    372191|00000000||Black Ones're garrisoned nearby. But they're still too weak to rule. So they struck a deal with the baron. Man's a puppet of sorts, but it's clear they've promised him somethin' in return.
    472705|00000000||If he had his way, he'd serve no man but himself.
    410479|00000000||A baron?
    410481|00000000||Aye, a righteous man and a just lord. Can't say an ill word about 'im.
   1063624|00000000||Got a family name for me?
   1063626|00000000||Dunno naught about families. But I'll not say an ill word about him or them.
   1063628|00000000||Wouldn't dream of making you badmouth him. Just wanna know a little more. He ruled for long?
   1063630|00000000||Not long. And you'll have to be content with that, I'll say no more.
    372139|00000000||Who rules this land?
    372145|00000000||Gotta go.
    372147|00000000||Such a shame.
    372141|00000000||Gotta go.
    372133|00000000||This is the Inn at the Crossroads, right?
    372149|00000000||This the Inn at the Crossroads?
    372151|00000000||Tis indeed. Novigrad road wends through 'ere. But armies and bandits - that's all that's on 'im now.
    410242|00000000||Novigrad a long way off?
    410244|00000000||Not that long. But with the Redanians just the other side of the Pontar, you'll not get there without a pass.
    410246|00000000||When we had hunger here, the pox, folk tried to flee there. Reds turned 'em back, or drowned 'em in the river.
    372161|00000000||How far to Novigrad?
    372163|00000000||War's brought some grief.
    372173|00000000||The Black Ones've brought you some grief.
    372175|00000000||Huh, no more than the Redanians. Same beast to my eyes. Reds stole our grain, said it were for the brave lads dyin' as they defend the Northern Realms.
    410238|00000000||Black Ones now make us give up what we stashed from the Reds. Say the emperor'll bring peace, but that comes at a price.
    410240|00000000||And when they clashed, red against black, corpse eaters came to feast on the dead. Cemetaurs and strixens crept from the woods, sniffin' for carrion. Howl so fierce these days that folk daren't leave their huts come night.
    372143|00000000||Why you pesterin' me?
    372129|00000000||Greetings.
    372131|00000000||Hm?
    410102|00000000||Got any beer?
    410104|00000000||The Black Ones burned down the brewery, so I've got some charred oak spirit.
    486502|00000000||So, how are things?
    492463|00000000||Good. More and more people come to our secret clinics looking for help.
    486504|00000000||Menge's hounds not scarin' 'em off any more?
    492465|00000000||I guess incurable disease is more terrifying than torture.
    486506|00000000||In that case, I'll count on more tribute comin' in.
    486508|00000000||You already take eighty percent of what we receive.
    480765|00000000||Aye, but don't forget it's me who secures the nooks and crannies where you and yours can hide.
   1074051|00000000||I do not like this place… I sense evil in the air.
    583590|00000000||Come on.
    548772|00000000||There you are.
   1074252|00000000||Good of you to come. I've been waiting for you.
    490324|00000000||So you enjoy good company, like to make new acquaintances?
    490326|00000000||Hehehehee. Plan to introduce me to someone interesting?
    489463|00000000||And now, my dear Dodo... I believe I'll try a different tool. Afraid I'm bored with this one.
    489464|00000000||You're fucking barmy, Junior… Anyone tell you that?
    490321|00000000||No, most say I'm nice… once they get to know me.
   1035317|00000000||What're you doin'? Why're you choppin' this?
   1035319|00000000||I'm fashioning a new model. Two-piece.
   1035320|00000000||What's gotten into you again?
   1035321|00000000||Wait and see. Just need to join these with the rivets, then clamp 'em loosely. Pieces'll move freely, then.
   1004270|00000000||The baron, through his men, has a mind to your well-bein'! And to that end, you've to provide them sustenance.
   1004271|00000000||What's that mean?
   1004272|00000000||It means you're to hand over a sack of flour or a piglet, dumbarse!
   1004273|00000000||Fail to, and the red flamin' cockerel will wake you, one and all!
   1071740|00000000||Gods… Where're we to find these goods? We're eatin' burdock ourselves…
    450979|00000000||Bloody Baron - how'd he get that moniker? There a story to it?
    450987|00000000||A time ago, when he was still in the army, some Black 'uns had holed up in a dye works. Baron and his men were ordered to take it. Others might've bided their time, starved 'em out, but the baron's an hasty one, attacked straightaway.
    450989|00000000||The Black 'uns surrendered. Baron and his men took most of 'em alive. But one of his blokes knocked over a vat of red dye. It all ran into the river.
    450991|00000000||Folk took to sayin' that the river'd flowed red with blood, er, that the baron had slaughtered his prisoners to a man. Been known as the Bloody Baron ever since.
   1033222|00000000||Kind of ironic.
   1011964|00000000||Well, a week before, he'd massacred a whole squadron in Ingholm. But far fewer heard that story.
    569935|00000000||The Bloody Baron - how'd he get his name?
    450993|00000000||Baron's not from around here, right?
    450995|00000000||He's Temerian, but from other parts. Folk say he deserted along with his company. Showed up here one day with his stragglers. They'd all had enough of the wanderin'.
    450997|00000000||So they took the old lord's castle, and the baron became master of Crow's Perch.
   1011999|00000000||Reckon once the Black 'uns feel sure they hold the land, they'll let 'im keep Crow's Perch, give 'im a true title.
   1011965|00000000||Baron ruled here long?
    569937|00000000||Thanks, Farewell.
    569936|00000000||Farewell.
    569934|00000000||Wouldn't mind a drink.
    570158|00000000||Wouldn't mind a drink. Show me what you got.
    570156|00000000||Hm, greetings.
   1006046|00000000||Burnt doppler - why the stench is entirely different, not human at all…

    473823|00000000||"Clashed with a Witch"
    473872|00000000||Somehow they learned Hendrik was looking for Ciri. Thus the torture…
    476458|00000000||I'm too late. My only leads - the baron, and some witch.
    526352|00000000||Damn.
    473870|00000000||Think that's all.

   1062114|00000000||Interesting headings…

    491865|00000000||Oy, Master Witcher! We've a gift for you!
    491291|00000000||But why ever would he want that?
    491293|00000000||Man'll be thrilled. Come on! Go!
    491302|00000000||Uhh, hmhm… We're, uh, grateful - we wanted to demonstrate that. So… we got this wee gift for ye.
    491362|00000000||Portrait of the hierarch. Nice.
    491363|00000000||Oh, it's nothing, really - got oodles of 'em. Just… if you wouldn't mind not mentioning where you got it… All right?
    491366|00000000||All right. Farewell.
    574091|00000000||No strong cards, no gold king - shan't be entering, shall we? Do we not know the rules?
    574092|00000000||But I've coin aplenty!
    574093|00000000||Then I suggest you return with better cards. And buy some more suitable attire. Achoo!
    515594|00000000||Come one, come all… Sack of flour bein' hauled here for the winner. No one out there wants to seize this chance?
    515595|00000000||Gray-haired fellow like you's got to be experienced. Will you fight Stan Fishgulper?
   1052532|00000000||I tell ye, I caught an eel thiiiis biiig! Five foot long, thick as me arm… and oh so plump!
   1052534|00000000||Not surprisin'. In wartime eels grow fat.
   1052536|00000000||Oh… why's that?
   1052538|00000000||Cause they feed on corpses. Pontar's thick with 'em now.
   1052540|00000000||So the world turns. Fish eat men, men eat fish and round and round it goes.
   1066792|00000000||Looking for a barber? Well, you've found one. Welcome! I'll ploughing shave the gentleman's noggin for half price!
   1066799|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a lot.
   1066805|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a bunch.
   1066801|00000000||This is not the look I wanted.
   1066803|00000000||And this is not the fate I wanted. I was to be an alderman in Mahakam. Instead, I shave and cut tramps and ragamuffins! Life deals what it deals, you shrug and you take it!
   1066798|00000000||Wrong cut, wrong coif.
   1066795|00000000||This is not what I wanted.
   1066797|00000000||What do you mean, not what you wanted? Are you cut and coiffed? You are. And even as even can be, I'd say.
    577814|00000000||Gimme a haircut? Uh, long as your hands aren't too shaky…
   1066793|00000000||Ah, welcome back to you! Satisfied customer always comes by again, eh?
   1066788|00000000||All right. How bad can it be?
   1066789|00000000||Another time, maybe.
    583991|00000000||All right, ladies! Dig deep, 'cause nose pickin' time's about to end!
   1027952|00000000||All of you on stage, now! High time to rehearse!
    546304|00000000||You're welcome.
    546307|00000000||Stop, can't handle all this gratitude. We really oughta learn our manners from the Elder Races, that's plain to see.
    546330|00000000||What would you expect? Payment? Or am I to fall into your arms, perhaps spread my legs for you?!
    546612|00000000||Go, vatt'ghern… And remember - we neither need nor want your pity.
    546305|00000000||Nothing I can do about that.
    546306|00000000||Then why get involved at all?
    546607|00000000||You didn't scare those boors off for my sake, but for your own. To feel just and noble. A knight on a swiving white steed. Or do I have it all wrong?
    546303|00000000||Nothing I can do about that.
    546598|00000000||You can breathe. It's over.
    546302|00000000||Over? For you, perhaps - you'll go your merry way… But I must stay here. And they will, too.
    546296|00000000||Leave her be.
    546298|00000000||By what right're you givin' me orders? Eh?
    546301|00000000||Let's go, Raddy. Killin's like battin' an eye for witchmen.
    546246|00000000||Leave her alone.
    546276|00000000||This is none of my business. Figure it out yourselves.
    546248|00000000||Just not my business, this.
    546247|00000000||You gotta tell the truth.
    546269|00000000||Why don't you just tell the truth?
    546272|00000000||Whaddaya mean, why? She's a nonhuman, lyin's in their blood!
    546574|00000000||Don't let that fair face beguile you, witcher. Pretty as a picture on the outside, she-elves… but the most vile filth within.
    546260|00000000||Think the lady's grown tired of your company.
    546261|00000000||Lady? What lady? See her ears? She-elf! And everyone knows that elves are always doin' somethin' on the sly!
    546262|00000000||I'm not doing anything, I swear it. I must just fetch some water.
    546263|00000000||Where will you put it? Where's your jug, eh?! Where's your bucket?!
    466280|00000000||Thank ye, sir… Don't know who y'are, but… I thank ye. They'd 'ave slaughtered us like swine…
    587216|00000000||Oh my, certainly took my request to heart.
    589905|00000000||Mean you weren't being serious? Still got time to change…
    589907|00000000||Don't you dare. You look great.
    587238|00000000||Everything's ready, we can go.
    589947|00000000||My, don't you look splendid. Sadly, I've got bad news.
    589949|00000000||Better not be joking. What - doublet doesn't match my boots, or vice versa?
    587237|00000000||It's not that.
    587192|00000000||I got a message - the Vegelbuds have postponed the ball. A family emergency, apparently.
    589974|00000000||Yeah, heard something about that.
    587249|00000000||Got a fox mask for you.
    587250|00000000||Thanks. Think anyone'll recognize me?
    590001|00000000||Well, I'd recognize you with a sack on your head.
    590004|00000000||You don't count.
   1000096|00000000||Learn anything else about Albert?
   1000098|00000000||Learn anything else about Albert?
   1000100|00000000||Well, almost none of the mages have heard of him. An amateur, I guess.
   1000106|00000000||So why the interest - temple guards first, then hunters?
   1000108|00000000||He's easy prey. And that's exactly why we should help him.
    587188|00000000||Bought the masks.
   1092247|00000000||Not yet.
    587190|00000000||Not yet.
   1083642|00000000||Need to prepare before we go.
    587189|00000000||Got a fox mask for you.
   1092245|00000000||Got a fox mask for you.
    587251|00000000||Come back once you've got it all.
    587241|00000000||We still have to wait for Ingrid Vegelbud's message.
    587194|00000000||Were you able to get everything we need?
   1092246|00000000||Do we still need it?
   1000080|00000000||We still need it?
   1000083|00000000||Ingrid wrote that she's counting on me. The ball's not canceled, it's just postponed.
   1092244|00000000||Bought the masks.
    587240|00000000||Just a shame you didn't dress up like I asked.
    590020|00000000||Really expected me to show up in a lacework collar, ruffles on my trousers?
    590022|00000000||You'd even look great wearing a bustle.
    590047|00000000||Doubt I wanna know what that is. For now, you'll just have to survive on bread and witcher.
    587566|00000000||[Put on wolf mask.]
    587568|00000000||[Put on bird mask.]
    587567|00000000||[Put on harlequin mask.]
    587243|00000000||Well then - shall we go?
    587242|00000000||A shame events like this are so rare. Without them I'd never get to see you dressed up.
    590024|00000000||Argh. Damn doublet's chafing my armpits. And it feels like they sewed wires into this.
    590025|00000000||I'll be sure to admire your valiant suffering the whole time.
    587208|00000000||Ingrid's servant brought a message - the ball's back on.
    587202|00000000||Geralt!
    589984|00000000||Someone's in a good mood.
    589993|00000000||So?
    589995|00000000||Nothing. Just, you look good when you're giddy.
    587187|00000000||You get everything?
    595020|00000000||Bought the masks.
    595021|00000000||Got a fox mask for you.
   1000079|00000000||Do we still need it?
    595022|00000000||Not yet.
   1055097|1084682c||Peasant
    383487|00000000||No thanks.
    383501|00000000||No thanks. Didn't come here to drink.
    383503|00000000||Hmph. As you will. But I'll not sit here adry, if you don't mind.
    408820|00000000||Before the war, there was a distillery nearby, best in Velen. But the whoresons burnt it to the ground.
    476926|00000000||I said already - I know who you are. Truth be told, it's the only reason we're talking.
    476931|00000000||Lovely place.
    476936|00000000||Lovely place.
    476932|00000000||Get to the point.
    476938|00000000||Didn't come here to talk about the scenery.
    476939|00000000||You're wrong to avoid the topic. You've just arrived, plain to see. And the local swamps and bogs - they're interesting to say the least.
    405725|00000000||Can you get to the point.
    476963|00000000||Get to the point already.
    476964|00000000||Ciri. That's why you've come, isn't it?
    476965|00000000||So she was here.
    476991|00000000||That a threat?
    476993|00000000||What's that supposed to mean? That a threat?
    476994|00000000||Oi, not as clever as I suspected you'd be.
    476995|00000000||No, it's no threat. I'll spell it out for you - I know who you're looking for.
    476967|00000000||She showed up some time ago - exhausted, wounded, and stinkin' like a soaked hound after a hard hunt.
    476969|00000000||Later I learned she'd come from the swamp…
    405731|00000000||You know I'm looking for Ciri.
    405733|00000000||I do.
    405701|00000000||I see where this is going.
    476943|00000000||Someone loses their way 'round here, he becomes damn hard to find.
    476944|00000000||What're you getting at?
    476959|00000000||Many have lost loved ones here. Some their wives, others their daughters…
    476954|00000000||Swamps, bogs, marshes everywhere…
    476956|00000000||Exactly.
    476934|00000000||I don't.
    476930|00000000||It's awful.
    476927|00000000||How do you like it here in Velen?
    476923|00000000||I know who you are. Truth be told, it's the only reason we're talking.
    405695|00000000||To the matter at hand - I'm Phillip Strenger, though the blobtits 'round here call me the Bloody Baron.
    405697|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Blobtits call me the Butcher of Blaviken.
    383497|00000000||Why not.
    383499|00000000||Hah! A man after me own heart. Hmm… with Foltest dead and Natalis' whereabouts unknown… bloody hell, who's a loyal Temerian to drink to these days?
    408786|00000000||Himself and his company?
    408788|00000000||Good enough.
    383481|00000000||Glad to have a drink.
    383479|00000000||Make yourself at home.
    408798|00000000||Now, where'd I put the bloody vodka…?
    408784|00000000||Ah, there it is! A snifter?
    549314|00000000||All right… That's done.
    470424|00000000||Maybe I oughta try the lamp?
    549295|00000000||Must be Jackamar's grave.
    504109|00000000||Our winner and the tavern's new champion is… the witcher called Geralt! Here is your prize.
    504087|00000000||I made you a lucrative offer, did I not?!
    504088|00000000||Yeah, but there's nothing quite like robbing a thief or cheating a cheat.
    504089|00000000||I shall remember this. Master Claytop never forgets a slight.
   1046643|00000000||Archibald O'Neill is another brawler you can fight. You'll find him near the entrance to the slums.
   1049677|00000000||There's also Mortimer, captain of the Guard. He can usually be found near the Oxenfurt Gate.
    505995|00000000||The witcher has fulfilled all conditions required to challenge Novigrad's reigning champion - Durden the Tailor!
    505997|00000000||The bout is to take place beyond the city walls after dusk.
    504084|00000000||You're bothering me, Master Claytop.
    504080|00000000||I trust you'll remember this lesson for the rest of your life. You stood to make a killing, but had scruples, instead.
    504081|00000000||Not too shabby, witcher.
    504082|00000000||Good fight. Congratulations.
    504085|00000000||Congratulations! A beautiful fight. Your reward, as promised.
    504111|00000000||The witcher Geralt has been defeated. It follows logically that Georgius Georg, known also as Piledriver, remains unbeaten!
    590945|00000000||Bad weather's bad for business.
    590947|00000000||Greetings! Welcome!
    590953|00000000||White One! Taken a peek at my wares yet?
    590965|00000000||Everyone to me! To me!
    590949|00000000||Best wares this side of the Pontar!
    590951|00000000||Hey!
    590963|00000000||Go on, don't think twice, just buy!
    590955|00000000||Oh, apologies.
    590957|00000000||Eternal Fire!
    590959|00000000||Oh my! Oh my!
    590961|00000000||Good folk! Give these marvels one more gander!
   1043912|00000000||Help! Anyone! Thief! Thief!
   1030410|00000000||A hunter of witches had an itch in his britches,
   1030412|00000000||so he sought comfort in the halls of lace.
   1030414|00000000||A strappin' lass he found, with a bosom profound, and a mysterious, charmin' face.
   1030416|00000000||In her minge was a balm that his fire did calm, brought a happy end to his hunt.
   1030418|00000000||But come the next morn he saw why his fire had died - his poor prick had turned into a cunt!
    490486|00000000||Got a job for you. Madame Irina's preparing a premiere. Need you to spread the word.
    490488|00000000||Why, we'd be delighted!
    490490|00000000||How much I need to pay you? We want the whole town talking about it.
    490492|00000000||Argh, nonsense. We shall do it for free.
    490493|00000000||You rid us of those bullies - consider it payment.
    490495|00000000||All right… You'll want to see Madame Irina to get the details.
    490510|00000000||We'll see her right away. You know it's heartening - a witcher not just partaking of cultured diversions, but aiding them.
    490512|00000000||Shit happens. See you at the premiere.
    490412|00000000||I want to hire you.
    490476|00000000||Glad I could help. Farewell.
    490414|00000000||Bye.
    490413|00000000||What did they want from you?
    490416|00000000||What'd they want from you?
    490418|00000000||We premiered a ballad recently - "Holy Hemmelfart, who his faith ignores, gorges himself, diddles old whores…" they'd been hounding us since.
    490420|00000000||They broke our instruments, dispersed our crowds… Lately, they took to lurking outside our home.
    490422|00000000||Didn't look terribly pious to me. Church of the Eternal Fire hire thugs like that now?
    490469|00000000||Yes, the city's full of such gangs.
    490371|00000000||Who… Who are you?
    490373|00000000||Geralt. A witcher. Looking for the Puffins - that you?
    490405|00000000||Yeah, that's us… but… you thrashed Fatso's boys. We saw everything from the window.
    490407|00000000||They your friends?
    490409|00000000||No! The opposite! They'd been hounding us, we dared not leave our home because of them.
    446273|00000000||{female bard sits by the window, plays the lute - sad, melancholic tune}
    366968|00000000||Nice tune… Damn sad, though.
    369074|00000000||Then it successfully conveys my mood… What do you seek here?
    369115|00000000||All right... Say I get Fatso and his boys to leave you alone. Will you publicize Irina's play then?
    369117|00000000||Of course, but… You shan't find it easy. There's no talking to that lot…
    369119|00000000||I'm not a great talker anyway.
    367010|00000000||Will you publicize the play if I help with Fatso?
    366976|00000000||They harm any of you?
    383753|00000000||They harm any of you?
    383755|00000000||No, not yet. But it's merely a question of time.
    383757|00000000||Nissa overheard talking about setting fire to something.
    446293|00000000||Don't want any coin from you. In fact, I'm willing to pay you, provided you agree to get the word out about Madame Irina's new play.
    446295|00000000||Oof, afraid that's impossible… Ever since we premiered our fateful ballad about "Holy Hemmelfart, who his faith ignores, gorges himself, diddles old whores," Fatso's gang has been harassing us incessantly…
    446297|00000000||Fatso's gang?
    446299|00000000||Common thugs in the Church's pay. City's full of gangs like that now.
    446303|00000000||They threatened Nissa - said they'd round off her pointy ears with a carving knife.
    446309|00000000||They don't let us perform, chase away spectators, destroy our instruments. Lately, they've taken to lurking outside our home. We're at wit's end, no clue what to do…
    446289|00000000||Got a job for you.
    446291|00000000||Another thug? Thanks.
    369105|00000000||Another thug? Flattered. Thanks.
    369107|00000000||Forgive us... You look threatening, and we've had our share of trouble lately.
    369109|00000000||Nissa's on edge these days. We all are.
    446275|00000000||Looking for the Puffins... Have I found them?
    446277|00000000||We've no coin. Leave us be!
    369111|00000000||Think there's been a mistake…
    446279|00000000||Sorry... Thought our landlord had hired another thug to collect from us…
    369082|00000000||Looking for the Puffins. This the place?
    446281|00000000||Never mind... So long.
    369080|00000000||Never mind.

    446285|00000000||Mood hasn't improved much, has it?
    446287|00000000||No reason it should have...
    551882|00000000||Something's not right…
    553189|00000000||Locked.
    418879|00000000||See that? Murdered half the folk of White Orchard, that one…
    418881|00000000||You can see the killer in his eyes.
    418883|00000000||Shhh, he might hear you.
   1053262|00000000||Mummyyy… Can trees walk?
   1053264|00000000||Don't be foolish. 'Course they can't.
   1053266|00000000||But me and Sophie saw one that did! And it had horns. Like a deer!
   1053268|00000000||What?! Where'd you see this tree?! Tell me!
   1053270|00000000||In the woods, outta town. We was gatherin' berries, 'member? You made jams outta 'em.
   1053272|00000000||You're never to go there again, understood? Never.
   1054349|00000000||"Witcher" - it even sounds proud.
   1084584|00000000||Open up! I command you to open the door!
   1084587|00000000||You needed merely to ask.
   1084590|00000000||Aaaaaaargh!
   1084592|00000000||Aaaaaaargh!
   1084594|00000000||That settles the score…
   1084597|00000000||And that was from the heart.
   1084600|00000000||Forgive me… I could not deny myself the pleasure.

   1064807|00000000||Eavesdropped on us. Back at the warehouse.
   1069996|00000000||What?! And you didn't think it worth mentioning?!
   1064809|00000000||Lads… The time to discuss this is later.
   1064811|00000000||Radovid is dead. It matters not by whose hand. Mission accomplished. Now let's get the hell away. Place'll be thick with Redanians in minutes.
   1064813|00000000||Let's go.
   1070662|00000000||We can discuss this later.
   1070664|00000000||Radovid's dead. Doesn't matter who killed him. Now let's get the hell out of here. Place'll be overrun by Redanians in minutes.

   1001915|00000000||Ah, Geralt. You know I've always liked you, but now it feels like more… You helped my daughter.
   1001917|00000000||A friend's daughter asked me for help. Not in the habit of turning my back in those situations.
    158974|00000000||Wanted to talk.
   1001919|00000000||Telling you Geralt, since you and Hjalmar defeated the Ice Giant together, I see you as one of our own.
   1001921|00000000||I got the look of a Skelliger?
   1001923|00000000||You've got the heart of an an Craite.
   1001991|00000000||Son's King of Skellige. Congratulations to you.
   1001993|00000000||Tis a great honor for the an Craite dynasty. First time one of ours sits on the throne.
   1001995|00000000||What kind of king will Hjalmar be?
   1001997|00000000||One who sheds blood, praises courage and condemns cowardice.
   1001999|00000000||And unites the clans against Nilfgaard?
   1002001|00000000||Of course. He's already decreed new longships be built.
   1001972|00000000||King Hjalmar - any thoughts?
   1049638|00000000||Any news of Hjalmar? His venture going well?
   1049641|00000000||Hah! Tempted after all, eh? If you're itching to join him, it might not be too late.
   1049653|00000000||Hm, maybe I should visit Undvik…
   1049655|00000000||Ask at the New Port. Clan Torrdaroch survivors lie around there. They refused to hunt the giant, but they're willing to talk.
   1049624|00000000||Any news of Hjalmar? His venture?
   1049667|00000000||Sorry, remind me - where'd Cerys go?
   1049669|00000000||Spikeroog. Got it in her head that she must help Udalryk.
   1049671|00000000||How?
   1049673|00000000||I've the same question. He's a brave man, some say hot-tempered and hasty, but…
   1049678|00000000||If Cerys wanted glory, she'd 'ave done better to sail with Hjalmar. As it is, who knows what ideas bat about in her head.
   1049665|00000000||Where'd Cerys sail off to? Remind me.
   1002394|00000000||You'll be hard pressed to defeat the imperial fleet.
   1002396|00000000||We will conquer or perish. Hjalmar and Cerys showed us how to die like heroes.
   1002398|00000000||Can't say how sorry I am about your loss, jarl.
   1002400|00000000||They died a good death.
    410219|00000000||War with Nilfgaard's already started from what I've seen.
    410221|00000000||We're ready for it.
   1002242|00000000||Nilfgaard's got a mighty fleet.
   1002246|00000000||My children know how to deal with foes.
   1001973|00000000||Think you can beat Nilfgaard?
   1002292|00000000||I found Ciri.
   1002294|00000000||Hah! I knew you'd do it! Safe and sound, I trust?
   1002296|00000000||Yes. She was fleeing from the Wild Hunt.
   1002298|00000000||Bring her to Kaer Trolde - she'll be safe here. And I must see how she's changed after all these years.
   1001974|00000000||I found Ciri.
   1002312|00000000||Thanks to you and Cerys, we know who's responsible. It's enough for me.
   1002314|00000000||Not gonna try to capture the berserkers?
   1002316|00000000||They were but tools, Wolf. I'd rather sever the hand that wields the sword than merely break steel.
   1002302|00000000||You and Hjalmar, you killed everyone who might've told us something.
   1002304|00000000||I know there're no witnesses, no evidence. But you must have suspects.
   1002306|00000000||Daily I ask myself who has gained from this crime? The answer is simple: Svanrige.
   1002308|00000000||Think he's capable of such treachery?
   1002310|00000000||If not him, then his mother.
   1072052|00000000||The inquest is ongoing. I'd rather not be hasty to condemn.
   1002300|00000000||The massacre during the feast - know anything new?
   1001975|00000000||Anything new on the massacre during the feast?
    574877|00000000||Of late, look seaward and you'll see their sun on a sail, starin' right back.
    574879|00000000||We've yet to capture any of their crew, but only a fool wouldn't know they're planning something.
   1041283|00000000||What's new in Skellige?
   1084402|00000000||What's the situation in the Isles?
    410215|00000000||See you, Crach.
    375961|00000000||Farewell.
    375959|00000000||Queen Cerys - any thoughts?
   1001977|00000000||Your daughter - first woman to rule Skellige.
   1001979|00000000||She'll be a good queen. Knows what she wants.
   1001981|00000000||Yeah… so what does she want?
   1001983|00000000||To unite all of Skellige's clans. A difficult task, no one has ever managed it, but Cerys is stubborn.
   1001987|00000000||Thinking long-term, then. Think she'll succeed?
   1001989|00000000||She's got a powerful ally. In me.
    496860|00000000||Quite the spring in your step for a man your age…
    496861|00000000||If you'd seen me in my prime! Thirty miles a day I did in full dress!
    496866|00000000||That witcherin' of yours, that good work?
    496867|00000000||High risk, low pay, clients are ingrates - so no, not really.
   1029111|00000000||Watch out! Behind you!
   1029136|00000000||Help! I can't… I can't hold out alone!
   1017971|0687b403||Smith
   1049258|00000000||Come on, good folk, clap for her! Clap! Witch needs some encouragement! Dance, cunt!
   1049264|00000000||Mercy… No more… I can't…
   1049266|00000000||Dance, wench. Dance 'fore I put a bolt through your gut.
   1049250|00000000||Good sir, ha' mercy! Me? A witch?! I made salves, is all! For meself, me achin' bones…
   1049252|00000000||Shouldn't 'ave placed your faith in witchcraft, sought out a medic instead.
   1049254|00000000||But I did! Surgeon took a sack of crowns 'fore he said there were naught he could do. The salves, they helped…
   1049256|00000000||Is that so? Wizardry helped you, eh? Let' see. Dance for me, witch. Or I'll put you down!
   1012862|00000000||Hmm...
   1012860|00000000||Hey!
   1012864|00000000||Greetings.
   1012858|00000000||I don't know…
   1012856|00000000||Hey!
   1012854|00000000||Bloody weather.

   1025527|00000000||Koviri yews are a sure thing, pure profit at no risk.
   1025529|00000000||Mhm. You said the same of Temerian bonds.
   1025531|00000000||An exception that proves the rule. The appearance of unexpected circumstances.
   1025533|00000000||Hm, I suppose that's true… Very well, buy them… After all, lightning never strikes in one place twice in a row, does it?
   1031344|00000000||How can I help ye?
   1031442|00000000||Need some armor made. Witcher's armor.
   1031352|00000000||Need you to make me some armor.
    421504|00000000||What're you selling, what's good?
   1090538|00000000||What do you have in stock?
   1086470|00000000||Care to play gwent?
   1031443|00000000||Take care, now.
   1031353|00000000||Farewell.
   1037524|00000000||Interesting accent…
   1037525|00000000||Interesting lilt in your voice. You originally from Skellige?
   1037553|00000000||Ard Skellig. Spent my whole childhood in Holmstein.
   1037555|00000000||Why'd you leave?
   1037556|00000000||Always had a liking for the smithy. I'd sit there all day, taking things in - the heat of the furnace, the smell of hot steel, the pounding hammers…
   1037557|00000000||At seventeen winters, me da told me he could teach me no more. Sent me out there into the world, bid me to hone my craft.
   1037560|00000000||A few years on, I had my master crafting papers. Then the war broke out and I landed here…
   1031345|00000000||Geralt! Good of you to come by. What can I do for you?
    582592|00000000||Please join me for the final.
   1014304|00000000||I must admit, I did not expect this outcome. Bet a rather large sum on another player, in fact.
   1014306|00000000||Might've guessed there were multiple games going on.
    582590|00000000||Well played. Congratulations on both your victories. I'd wanted to summon the guards, initially, but…
    582591|00000000||Yeah, it's better I took care of it.
    580356|00000000||Hey, there!
    580358|00000000||Here's some advice. If you can't sing it well, sing it loud!

   1006704|00000000||You're free now.
   1006706|00000000||Oh, thank you… Thank you! If not for you…
   1006708|00000000||He asked… if I did everything. And I said, "For the right price, of course." And then he smiled… Oh gods, it gave me the shivers… And then he hit me. So hard I passed out.
   1006710|00000000||I was bound when I came to. And he was heatin' the poker, in the fire.
   1006712|00000000||Calm down. He won't hurt you anymore. He won't hurt anyone.
    460072|00000000||… and then, a colossal boom!
    460074|00000000||Oh!
    508779|00000000||And? And?
    508782|00000000||Nothing. I leapt out of the way in time, naturally, and it merely singed my eyebrows.
   1000380|00000000||Alchemy can be a dangerous sport.
    508792|00000000||Oh my!
    509165|00000000||One needs the agility and reflexes of a panther. Wrrraor!
    477306|00000000||A book? You mean to patch a henhouse?
    477308|00000000||My grandad once returned from his travels with a book. Fetched enough to buy him a home.
    477311|00000000||Stop chattering and help me search!
    465771|00000000||I can't let this happen. I won't.
    465773|00000000||Figured it might end this way.
    499168|00000000||Get him!
    465767|00000000||Can't let this happen.
    499157|00000000||No interest to me.
    465775|00000000||This is just not my business.
    465777|00000000||Clever man, clever man. You'd fit right in if you cared to join us.
    465769|00000000||As you were.
    499162|00000000||What's going on here?
    499164|00000000||Sir, me daughter… Help us!
    499166|00000000||My men need some diversion from time to time. They get jumpy elsewise.
    499156|00000000||What's going on here?
    465749|00000000||You'll shut your trap if you want this to be done soon! The man needs to concentrate.
    465751|00000000||You're whoresons, all!
    465753|00000000||I said shut it.
    465757|00000000||What you lookin' at? Wanna be next for a thrashin'?
    475161|00000000||Don't kill me! 'Tweren't me! I'd never dare!
    475163|00000000||A witcher! Hair white as milk. He went that way!
   1008684|00000000||Witcher.
   1008725|00000000||Iconoclast!
   1008727|00000000||You jest!
   1073470|00000000||Ghouls dragged the body downstairs. But it wasn't their kill.
   1073472|00000000||Skin's unnaturally pale, cracked… Hm…
   1073474|00000000||Dried blood. Really old.
   1073476|00000000||The singeing, on the other hand, is fresh… unnatural. Medallion vibrates near it.
   1072970|00000000||Oughta explore the tower.
   1072961|00000000||Blood trail leads to the cellar.
    349255|00000000||Hide the children! Bar the doors! Quick!
    482578|00000000||All right. Time to check the attic.
    401705|00000000||Why have you come...? Why spill this blood...?
    488000|00000000||Are you here to grant me death…? Or is my freedom your wish…?
    405305|00000000||You claim I can free you.
    405311|00000000||You claim to be imprisoned. How so?
    405313|00000000||I am bound here... In fetters of magic... I wander endlessly... A labyrinth of leaves…
    405315|00000000||The children... I know all... I know what awaits them... Free me, please... I must help…
    405317|00000000||If something threatens the orphans, I'll help them myself.
    405319|00000000||The children have been taken... Free me, please...
    405323|00000000||I can be a gale... A gallop unchained... I shall save them... Only I can…
    416461|00000000||I saw women, children even, lying dead on this hill. Did they want to destroy you?
    416518|00000000||To nature... To the forest and earth... All death is alike... Every death is equal…
    416520|00000000||I cry... I wail... None listen…
    416431|00000000||Found corpses on the hill. Murder victims.
    487452|00000000||If you can save the orphans from the meadow, I'll help you.
    487454|00000000||I will find them… Free them…
    487456|00000000||Open the door of my cage… Blood is my escape…
   1048341|00000000||Go now… And return through the passage I have opened.
    391540|00000000||Gather and return... To the hillock's depths... To the tree's rotten heart…
    405325|00000000||Pierce my heart... Let blood flow…
    418861|00000000||To be born again... I must first be consumed...
    487580|00000000||I'll gather what I need to free you. Then return.
    487531|00000000||Be back once I have everything.
    487530|00000000||Why do we need a black horse?
    391491|00000000||The beast and I shall be as one… As when I lived... We shall be a gale... Nothing to stop us.
    487583|00000000||A wild steed... From meadows moist…
    487533|00000000||A horse.
    487585|00000000||Where'll I find your remains?
    487587|00000000||My bones… They lie in a solitary mound…
    487589|00000000||Nearby… due west…
    487534|00000000||Your remains.
    487532|00000000||Raven feathers.
    391485|00000000||Got some raven feathers.
    487529|00000000||Find my remains... And bring me a mount…
    391487|00000000||A wind-born steed... A black squall turned horse…
    391459|00000000||Swarms of ravens attacked me not far from here. Might be some feathers on the ground or in their nests.
    391461|00000000||Bring the feathers of ravens... With them I'll be free…
    403982|00000000||Don't have any raven feathers. Gotta look around.
    403984|00000000||Raven nests you'll find… near Downwarren…
    396048|00000000||A rite you must perform… With the black of raven feathers... the white of my bones... And a swift steed…
    586663|00000000||A mare, wild and free… in meadow's pasture caught… dark as a bottomless well… black as the depths of night… Such a beast, no other.
    401945|00000000||Gather these and bring them here…
    487458|00000000||Deal. I'll help you.
    487460|00000000||Imprisoned for years... I shall be free again…
    487462|00000000||Break my fetters… Blood is my escape…
    401833|00000000||I'll help you.
    401957|00000000||Dare harm me... and against you will rise... all the powers of nature…
    401955|00000000||I don't believe you, spirit. Too many claim you're evil. Your words alone - not enough.
    401835|00000000||I don't believe you.
    452653|00000000||I can't decide just yet.
    482266|00000000||You must come back... Free me... I beg you…
    482270|00000000||Beware my sentries… They stand guard still…
    452651|00000000||Gotta think this over.
    419899|00000000||Why do you think the kids from the meadow are in danger?
    419901|00000000||The sisters took them. They shall not return.
    419903|00000000||Where'd they take them? I can help.
    419905|00000000||It is done already... It cannot be undone... There are no roads... To Aard Cerbin…
    419907|00000000||They shall all die... Let them be saved...
    419897|00000000||The kids in the clearing are in danger?
    498173|00000000||The Crones? Whaddaya know about them?
    498175|00000000||The sisters are older than the oldest trees… Velen is their realm… All life here serves them…
    498177|00000000||The sisters live concealed. You will not find them. They hear all… you cannot hide.
    498171|00000000||The Crones - whaddaya know about them?
    416821|00000000||Found human corpses on the hillock. They were murdered.
    452664|00000000||I'm back.
    452666|00000000||I've been waiting... You've returned... Your decision?
    491208|00000000||Help... Help... Help... I long to be free once more...
    452668|00000000||At Aard Cerbin... Death looms for the orphans…
    482264|00000000||Free me, I beg you... I can help them…
    405200|00000000||I can hear a voice. Can't see who it belongs to, though.
    405202|00000000||I am but a spirit... I am but a whisper…
    405307|00000000||Whisper to the wolves. Tell them to stay away. Who are you?
    405309|00000000||Once I protected them... Now they protect me… I protected this spot… from the Crones.
    489470|00000000||The Crones killed me… My spirit they captured… Imprisoned me in the tree...
    491206|00000000||Help... Aid me... Free me... I wish to be free again…
    401829|00000000||I sense no wrath…
    405914|00000000||Didn't come here in anger.
    416514|00000000||Beguiled by darkness. But your heart... It is not black…
    401723|00000000||Didn't set out to hurt anyone. I was attacked - had to defend myself.
    405178|00000000||Why was I attacked?
    405184|00000000||I was attacked.
    405186|00000000||This is my prison... A fortress besieged...
    420688|00000000||Murderers I await… And my forest protects me…
    405188|00000000||Murderers?
    405190|00000000||Murderous sisters... Killed my body... Now my soul they hunt... For I defy them.
    416528|00000000||What do you know about the Crones?
    416532|00000000||Must know the Crones pretty well.
    416534|00000000||They are Velen's curse...
    416536|00000000||They hear all through severed ears… They weave hair and twist lives…
    416538|00000000||They take their strength from a broth of human flesh…
    416530|00000000||Why did they kill you?
    416546|00000000||Why did they kill you?
    416548|00000000||The Crones want this land. They'd rule the wood alone.
    419929|00000000||I stood in their way… I had to die…
    405182|00000000||Who are you?
    405291|00000000||Who are you?
    405293|00000000||I abandoned my Circle... Where I'd kept the balance... The Crones killed me... And cursed my ghost…
    405295|00000000||Never heard of a druids' circle in Velen.
    416524|00000000||I wander eternally through a maze of boughs... Helplessly sliding o'er rustling leaves…
    498580|00000000||I don't like that guy.
    497715|00000000||Brandon? I don't either. He's much too fat.
    499861|00000000||Can't help but agree. But no - notice how he didn't try to haggle?
    499863|00000000||Must really want the rats out.
    499865|00000000||Triss… He's a merchant. He makes his living by haggling.
    499867|00000000||If I worried about that sort of thing, I'd starve to death in this city.
   1052567|00000000||You know Gerard? Fellow from the hills outside town, brought sheep cheese to market?
   1052569|00000000||Course I know him. Good man. Always asks about me wife, gives me treats for the kiddies. How is he?
   1052571|00000000||Dead. They say somethin' stole his ewe. 'Stead of movin' on, he went to look for it… and perished.
   1052573|00000000||A few days on a dog brought his hand back to the village. That's all his family got to bury.
   1052575|00000000||Shame to hear it… Know what did him in?
   1052577|00000000||Some beast… And no one's in a hurry to find out what kind. Even though there's a bounty on its head.
    477719|00000000||Dog's bollocks, I didn't want to kill him.
    477720|00000000||Mighta thought of that beforehand.
    477721|00000000||Aaargh…
   1069932|00000000||One Nilfgaardian mole less.
   1069934|00000000||Can't actually know he was a spy.
   1069936|00000000||Oh, he was, he was. I know them on sight. Seen my share
   1069938|00000000||On your way, now. You're no use to us.
   1069940|00000000||Fuckin' neutrality… Fatherland needs to be defended.
    477722|00000000||Let's search his body. Might've been carryin' documents, a message.
    477725|00000000||You're on your own.
    477726|00000000||Thanks for your help - one Nilfgaardian spy less.
    504846|00000000||Take this. It oughta prove useful.
    477716|00000000||He's dead.
    477718|00000000||You should go.
   1069994|00000000||Ah! Had it right. Purse full of Nilfgaardian florens.
    434986|00000000||Quiet, wait till he leaves.
    467852|00000000||Maybe he's got food.
    467854|00000000||Even if, he won't give us nothin'.
    377299|00000000||Easy... Jumpy, are we? Sheathe your steel? Please?
    173504|00000000||Got a simple question. You're gonna give me a simple answer.
    427956|00000000||Where's the Putrid Grove?
    358430|00000000||In… in Lacehalls… Down an alley… Man guardin' the gate… Gotta give 'im the password…
    381470|00000000||What is the password?
    381472|00000000||Old sow's farrowed piglets.
    427958|00000000||See? Just gotta make the effort.
    173528|00000000||Stop… Enough… I was just followin' orders…
    525761|00000000||Huh, rest of the candlestick. And wine stains. Somebody smashed a bottle.
    528376|00000000||From Toussaint. Yeah, Erveluce. Scent hasn't died. Wonder where it'll lead me.
   1073994|00000000||Wooden candlestick. Stem's broken.
   1073996|00000000||Hmm, it gets interesting. Piece of wood looks like the stem of that candlestick. No coincidence there.
   1074058|00000000||Hmm… fight might've happened here. Oughta look for clues.
    525754|00000000||Mangled bit of a candlestick. Someone smashed it against the wall and broke clear into the wardrobe.
    525755|00000000||Getting interesting. Might be more traces of fighting. Gotta look around.
    471675|00000000||Fresh flowers. He expects them to return any minute. Takes hope.
    525712|00000000||Incense, and an old key. Wonder what it unlocks…
    525715|00000000||Anise, sandalwood and something else… Saffron?
    525750|00000000||What's this? Ah. Gotta wonder who wanted to hide the hole… and what's on the other side.
    471673|00000000||The baron and his wife. Hm, look happy enough.
    525769|00000000||Damn, trail breaks off. Could find something else, though.
    525759|00000000||Deep nicks. Hit with a heavy object.
    525742|00000000||Wall's a different color. Something used to hang here.
   1057969|00000000||Hm… that painting? Right size.
    359610|00000000||Hm? Damn ugly for a doll.
    475524|00000000||The kind you'd stick with pins to hurt someone.
    397282|00000000||Won't find much else here.
    471685|00000000||Hmm… spruce wood. Smells of juniper incense. Some sort of folk talisman, protective.
    475560|00000000||Question is - against what?
    338070|00000000||An altar. So, the Eternal Fire's made it to Velen.
    574220|00000000||We can.
    574221|00000000||Well, let's have a name, then, and we shall issue an entry ticket.
    574222|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    575454|00000000||Gerard… of Rivia. The match will start soon, but the hoi polloi must first be driven out. We will please wait. Achoo!
    574217|00000000||We can.
    574210|00000000||As I thought. Let's return once we've collected better cards, hm? And a thousand crowns for the buy-in, of course. Achoo!
   1001108|00000000||Not yet.
   1001109|00000000||Then why bother us at all? Return with the coin.
    574218|00000000||Not yet.
   1010395|00000000||Cards are in order… But can we afford the buy-in?
    574130|00000000||Firstly, we must have the proper effects. Let's have a look at our cards, shall we?
   1000931|00000000||Heard you play for high stakes here.
   1013862|00000000||Wanna enter the tournament.
   1013902|00000000||So long.
   1013863|00000000||Farewell.
   1013867|00000000||Achoo! Yes?
   1038524|00000000||Seems mom didn't teach this little griffin not to play with its food…
    400720|00000000||Thank you. We got nowhere to go back to. Novigrad - that's a chance of a new life.
    400722|00000000||Stay off the roads. Liable to run into another patrol.
    400724|00000000||Shan't be taken like that again. We'll be as careful as hares in a field bared by winter!
   1072054|00000000||But you, you was cast in a different mould than us. More like the hero that lies in the tomb 'neath Crookback Hills.
   1075841|00000000||Tomb's in a cave in a hillside. Downwarren's at the foot o' the hill. Folk say treasure inside's a sight to behold, huge hoard. Might find somethin' that suits you. Good luck.
    363528|00000000||Gold coin…
    425113|00000000||Trail ends here. Dandelion must've loaded the treasure onto a boat…
    520838|00000000||Witcher, sir! Help a woman in need!
    521022|00000000||Come back, Sir Witcher! If you shan't help me, who will?
    521203|00000000||Enjoy rummaging through others' possessions?
    521204|00000000||Relax, I--
    521214|00000000||You're a thief, sir. Do you know the punishment for thievery in Novigrad? Severance of the hands.
   1048404|00000000||You must go now. I've no time for you, I must gather my things.
    521277|00000000||I'm not done with you!
   1056241|00000000||Here… A key to a treasure. There are three in all. Follow the hunters to find the other two. I… must flee. Now.
    524665|00000000||Don't enjoy being tricked.
    524667|00000000||Tricked? I only said my house was haunted. I could not know it was hunters…
    524669|00000000||Mhm. Except the hunters knew exactly who they were waiting for. Reeks of a trap to me.
   1056239|00000000||Very well. Perhaps I've not been completely candid… Especially as I've no gold for the reward, either. Which does not mean you shall walk away empty-handed.
   1056243|00000000||You saved my life… I don't believe you wished to, but you did. A reward is in order.
    524663|00000000||Don't like being tricked.
    524616|00000000||Thanks, see ya.
    521373|00000000||Thank you ever so much. Behold - your reward.
    524671|00000000||Then go outside, get some air. I've given you your reward, you've no reason to stay.
    524078|00000000||Sounds like a wight or a puffbow… Fine, I'll tend to it.
    524080|00000000||Thank you ever so much! Come with me… I will show you the way.
    520870|00000000||Fine.
    520873|00000000||Sorry. Don't have time for this right now.
    520874|00000000||No time to defend me from specters? What kind of witcher are you?
    524058|00000000||A busy one.
    520871|00000000||Don't have time.
    520839|00000000||What's the problem?
    520867|00000000||My house, something haunts it. It howls, rattles chains, shatters plates… I fear merely being there.
    524054|00000000||Will you see what sort of phantom this is? I'll spare no amount of gold!
   1048321|00000000||Will you see what specter haunts me? I've gold, it's no object, I'll spare no amount!
    524673|00000000||So long - and be careful. Lots more of those… phantoms all over town.
   1053531|00000000||I require a gift for my wife.
   1053533|00000000||Understood. Does the gentleman have anything specific in mind?
   1053535|00000000||Oh, I don't know… Whatever's most expensive.
   1053537|00000000||Ooh… A special occasion on its way, an anniversary, perhaps?
   1053539|00000000||That's the rub - it already came. Yesterday. And I forgot.
    386125|00000000||Found you all. Now you gotta keep your word and help me talk to Johnny's friend.
    386127|00000000||Why wouldn't we? Promised, didn't we?
    519423|00000000||Take pity, sir. I've a sick child… even more misery besides!
    401694|00000000||Back... Turn back... Turn back… Turn back…
    401696|00000000||Gone… Begone… begone… Begone….
    455187|00000000||Aye?
    450170|00000000||Mind if I go inside the workshop?
    450172|00000000||I've not even peeked inside since… since they found Fabian. But I'll open it for you if you want.
    450126|00000000||We've talked enough.
   1004241|00000000||Fine, we've talked enough.
   1004247|00000000||Won't learn anything else here. Take care.
   1004243|00000000||Need to look around.
   1004245|00000000||Be my guest. Just beware o' the dogs.
    455185|00000000||Open the workshop for me.
    572426|00000000||Already know what happened. Fabian was in the workshop. Murderer attacked him there. They struggled, Fabian was overpowered… then tortured. For a time.
    455161|00000000||I needn't know the details. Truth be told, I haven't the stomach for 'em.
    455163|00000000||When it was over, the murderer dragged Fabian to the courtyard. Then made a pyre of sculptures, set them aflame.
    455165|00000000||But… why? Why do all that?
    455173|00000000||To teach a lesson. To him, you… the whole city.
    455153|00000000||Already know exactly what happened.
    457938|00000000||Had a look at your sculptures.
   1004211|00000000||And? Lifelike, aren't they?
   1004213|00000000||Mhm. The women especially. Never seen a bust that size on Melitele.
   1004215|00000000||Oh, aye - Fabian's handiwork. I told him - brother, tits like that would crush her back, whittle 'em down. He said nay, they'd sell better this way. Told me to shut me trap.
   1004217|00000000||And sell they did. Till one sermon at the Temple, when the celebratin' reverend said that who so buys idols from the nonhuman Meyers sins twofold - as a heretic, and as a lecher. That was the end o' that.
    457924|00000000||Looked at your sculptures.
    450085|00000000||Tell me what you know about the murder. In order, in detail.
   1004176|00000000||Twas like this. Had some work in Oxenfurt, and I was comin' home. Saw a plume o' smoke risin' over the city. Thought to meself, "Blast it, gonna miss 'em burnin' another hag!" But the smoke wasn't comin' from Hierarch Square… it was comin' from here.
    450087|00000000||See the soot stains? That's where they burned our sculptures. Folk gathered 'round the blaze… and found Fabian here, beside it. They'd already loaded 'im on the cart by the time I arrived.
    450093|00000000||Talk to your neighbors? They see anything suspicious beforehand? Hear anything?
   1004182|00000000||Claimed not to. But even if they had, they'd not 'ave helped. In Novigrad folk give bleedin' orphans in the street a wide berth so as not to stain their poulaines. What do they care about some dwarf?
    450114|00000000||Know much about the murder?
    450116|00000000||Your brother have any enemies?
    450122|00000000||Your brother have any enemies? Anyone dislike him? Threaten him, maybe?
    450124|00000000||Nay… 'Twas Fabian who threatened this one lass.
   1004203|00000000||Oh, he were a good dwarf, a craftsman like no other. But he were an incorrigible whoremonger as well. Whenever we'd put a bit o' coin aside, I'd say, "Let's buy some tools, quality timber." No. He'd grab the purse and head out whorin'.
   1004205|00000000||Took to following one in particular. He'd say, "'Tis all your fault, dirty bitch, human dishrag!" - and other obscenities. Don't rightly know what that was about. Maybe he was in love with her?
   1004207|00000000||Know where I can find her? This… dishrag?
   1004209|00000000||City cemetery. She died a few days back. Quietly, in her sleep. Her ponce said a fever took her.
   1004120|00000000||So, who might you be?
   1004122|00000000||The stiff's brother. Gus's the name. We ran a workshop together - "Meyer and Meyer."
   1004124|00000000||Mhm. What'll it be now - "Just Meyer"?
   1004126|00000000||Nay, mate. I'll be closing it down now. Soon as I find a buyer for this shack I'll head home to Mahakam. Be nearer my family, or what's left of it…
   1013834|00000000||So, whaddaya wanna know, what can I tell you about Fabian?
   1004117|00000000||So, you are… ?
   1004118|00000000||Charming creatures.
   1004130|00000000||Charming as beasts go.
   1004132|00000000||Ye daft? Even I'm scared o' them. But better a barkin' dog than an evil man at your door.
   1004134|00000000||Got someone particular in mind?
   1004136|00000000||Sure as shite. Bugger who did Fabian in.
   1004138|00000000||Soon as they'd hauled his corpse off, I ran to a mate who raises fightin' dogs. Bought these two mutts. Cost me a chunk o' change… But I sleep sound, at least.
    572411|00000000||Anyone home?
   1004108|00000000||Begone! Or I'll sick me hounds on ye! Mauler! Striga! Come!
   1004114|00000000||Relax. I'm here about Fabian Meyer. Looking for his killer.
   1004116|00000000||That's altogether different. Sit, ye stupid mutts, lie down! C'mon, come on in. Slowly now, lest they bite ye.
   1071315|00000000||Pardon me… Witcher Geralt? Of Rivia?
   1071378|00000000||No, Gehrlat of Lyria, merchant.
   1071380|00000000||Heh, she warned me. Of this sort of thing. That you might say so.
   1071374|00000000||No, a merchant. From Lyria.
   1071373|00000000||Yeah. I'm him.
   1071376|00000000||Yeah. What do you want?
   1071382|00000000||I've a message. For you.
   1071385|00000000||Hang on. Who from?
   1071387|00000000||Read it. You'll know.
   1071317|00000000||Sent by Triss, must've been. I should find her.
    385914|00000000||Found me.
    557726|00000000||Greetin's.
    557723|00000000||You goin' north, master?
    557724|00000000||Why do you ask?
    557725|00000000||Thought you could see if anythin's happened to our men. They've been gone a while.
   1067345|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1067351|00000000||My reward - how do you wanna figure it?
   1072715|00000000||Oh, ah, we thought-- But aye, ye… you're owed for your trouble.
   1067355|00000000||Why so dear?! Ye think we've a dwarven vault nestled in the underbrush? That's too much, definitely.
   1067357|00000000||Dunno, dunno… Could ye drop it a bit more?
   1067361|00000000||Would ye strip a man of his breeches o'er his head? For a small favor?! Take what's offered, or I'll find another.
   1067359|00000000||If that suits ye, excellent.
    557788|00000000||What do you need?
    557789|00000000||Merchant caravan came through not long past. Hired some of our boys to guide 'em to the bridge. They were due back yesterday…
    557790|00000000||Fine. Keep my eyes open.
    557791|00000000||Me brother Thomil lead 'em. Talk to him when you find them. Clever man, not like the rest of 'em, eh?
    557712|00000000||What do you need?
    557776|00000000||Farewell.
    557715|00000000||Farewell.
    557713|00000000||Found your friends.
    557797|00000000||I found your friends.
    557798|00000000||Aye, I've spoken to 'em. Eh, too damn bad Thomil didn't make it…
   1073544|00000000||Master witcher, a word, if ye will. Might have a job for ye. Couple of our folk have gone missin' and--
   1073546|00000000||Think I ran into them, cave north of here? A wyvern attacked them, one lost his life, but the others should be here soon.
   1073548|00000000||Dammit all, we never should've split, let 'em go off on their own. The wyvern… did ye cut it down? All the one of ye?
   1073550|00000000||Your friends weren't exactly eager to help. Didn't find the decency to offer a reward, either.
   1073552|00000000||How am I to know ye speak the truth?
   1073554|00000000||Suppose we can wait till they get back. Though I should charge you more, if so.
   1073913|00000000||Naye, no need. Gods'll judge ye if you've not spoke the truth.
    557805|00000000||Here, take this.
    591445|00000000||Thanks.
    557770|00000000||Master, ye witcher Geralt of Rivia?
    557771|00000000||Depends.
    557772|00000000||Some of our folk claim a witcher, a great hero, dragged 'em from a wyvern's maw. We've a reward…
    557773|00000000||Then I'm definitely Geralt of Rivia.
   1004425|00000000||Heard you can get food from the baron's men.
   1004426|00000000||Get it? How?
   1004427|00000000||You know… You just gotta…
   1004428|00000000||Sweet Melitele!
   1004429|00000000||They give you a lot?
   1030425|00000000||He order 'em captured or killed?
   1030427|00000000||We were to kill, find any excuse…
   1030429|00000000||You could always claim they tried to use magic.
   1030431|00000000||Witch "hunters," my arse… witch butchers, more like.
    572604|00000000||Keira? Where…?
    589960|00000000||Put me to sleep with a spell. Means she's up to something.
    589962|00000000||Fyke Isle. The tower.
   1021596|00000000||Come to bask in our misfortune?
   1021598|00000000||I know you! You're the one killed King Foltest!
   1021600|00000000||I hate every last one of you.
   1021582|00000000||Leave me alone.
   1021584|00000000||Pfff.
   1021586|00000000||Get stuffed.
   1021588|00000000||I've had enough.
   1021590|00000000||Gods!
   1021592|00000000||We'll all die!
   1021594|00000000||Sod off!
    555150|00000000||Salah vatt'ghern!
    555151|00000000||Bloede varh'he!
    555149|00000000||Marh'vae!
    555148|00000000||I wonder how long you'll last.
    475190|00000000||Run for your lives!
    475188|00000000||Fire!
    563105|00000000||Let's go. This way.
    563100|00000000||There must be another entrance - I'd bet more than coin on it. The elven mage surely had some sort of a shortcut.
    563107|00000000||We going?
    563108|00000000||Mhm.
    592476|00000000||Meaning we didn't actually have to meander around these ruins?
    592477|00000000||Of course we did. The entrance is very well-protected. I'd never have found it from the outside.
    407543|00000000||Yes, but next time…
    417453|00000000||Challenge me again - raise your hand, draw your sword, look at me the wrong way… and I'll kill you.
   1049928|00000000||You so sure o' that?
   1049930|00000000||Yes.
   1049932|00000000||We shall see!
    417445|00000000||Next time I'll kill you.
    417451|00000000||Get outta my sight.
    417455|00000000||Go back to Maid Bilberry and apologize for being an ass. Quick, before I change my mind and break your bones.
    422645|00000000||We shall meet again!
    407541|00000000||Yes, luck stood with you! B-but the next time we meet…
    407557|00000000||Had enough?
   1072304|00000000||We're no longer prisoners - that's what's important. All will be well now. It must.
   1072302|00000000||We were lucky to land here… Perhaps we can start anew, live again.
    360040|babf8b78||Prisoner
    537562|00000000||All right. What've you got there?
    537575|00000000||Magic accessories. Alchemy ingredients, potions, and much more.
    542493|00000000||Interesting. Don't look a bit like a mage.
    542495|00000000||True, perhaps because I'm not a mage. I just… take care of the sundries the poor folk who burn at the stake leave behind. Ensure they end up in the right hands.
    540854|00000000||Has to stay out of your way. 'Cause he sells the things dead mages leave behind.
    540858|00000000||Eternal Fire burns bright thanks to men like you. Hans! Gustav! Added pay to whoever nabs the halfling!
    537534|00000000||He sells the property of dead mages.
    540874|00000000||Left his soup on the burner.
    540875|00000000||I've half a mind to put you on the burner, wise arse. Got my eye on you. Let's go!
    537535|00000000||Left his soup on the burner.
    540852|00000000||The halfling - what did he want? And why'd he bolt when he saw us comin'?
    540847|00000000||Naught but rarities, at unbeatable pri--…. Oh shit! You didn't see me here!
    537580|00000000||Fine, what do you have?
    537496|00000000||Show me what you got.
    537581|00000000||I don't do deals with vultures.
    537497|00000000||I don't buy from vultures.
    546063|00000000||Lookin' to buy?
   1053583|00000000||What village're you from?
   1053585|00000000||Willows. It's in Temeria, two days' road from Vizima. Nilfgaard arrived there just afore winter.
   1053587|00000000||Black Ones didn't do no harm, not at first… Till guerillas attacked their garrison, that is. Then they set our hovels alight.
   1053589|00000000||Why? You hadn't done nothin' to 'em!
   1053591|00000000||Nilfgaardians are strict masters. Exact punishment for every crime. Even if they can't catch the criminal.
   1030920|00000000||Must be that legendary forge… Need to look around for tools.
   1037084|00000000||Just remembered it now.
   1037088|00000000||Tell you the truth, I just remembered.
   1037090|00000000||Ehh, Geralt. Preaching morals to me, yet you forget who you've killed?
   1037029|00000000||Lambert, let's talk about this.
   1037031|00000000||No, let's not. This is one of those situations, serious situations, when you don't ask unnecessary questions and just help your friend.
   1037027|00000000||We need to talk first.
   1037026|00000000||Fine.
   1004832|00000000||Where'll we meet once I'm back?
   1003632|00000000||At the Nowhere Inn.
   1003633|00000000||All right. I'm off. Good luck.
   1037082|00000000||Find anything on Hammond's body? Something that might help us?
   1003705|00000000||No.
   1003706|00000000||Then I have a request. Go back, to wherever you found him. Look for anything about Karadin. Hammond might've kept some souvenirs of the old days…
   1004851|00000000||I'll go to Tretogor, find Selyse. Meet you back at the Nowhere Inn.
   1003708|00000000||Found some letters on Hammond's body… might be helpful.
   1003709|00000000||I'll look 'em over. Meet me in the morning at the Nowhere Inn.
   1003796|00000000||What about Selyse?
   1003797|00000000||Let's see what's in the letters, first. Might not need to go to Tretogor at all.
   1037086|00000000||Vienne was talking. Didn't want to interrupt.
   1037083|00000000||Didn't want to interrupt Vienne.
   1003699|00000000||No point in my going to Skellige. Hammond won't tell anybody anything.
   1004838|00000000||Why not?
   1004840|00000000||I killed him.
   1004842|00000000||Why didn't you say anything?
   1037025|00000000||You gotta help me, Geralt. Best thing'll be to split up. You sail to Skellige, try to squeeze something outta Hammond.
   1004860|00000000||I'll go to Tretogor and meet with Selyse.
    580191|00000000||Hmmm?
    580193|00000000||Ta ra ri rrra ra…
    426598|00000000||What the… Over here!
   1052240|00000000||They found another corpse yesterday. Drained to the last drop, not a ounce o' blood left. Skin and bones.
   1052242|00000000||Blast… Streets ain't safe no more.
   1052244|00000000||Ah, you got nothin' to fear. Haven't you heard? The beast only attacks rich blokes. Won't even glance at you.
   1052246|00000000||What's this drivel…? Since when's a monster care if a man's wealthy or poor?
   1052248|00000000||Maybe they taste different? You know, a fish lives in the muck's got different flesh than one that swims clear mountain streams.
   1032838|00000000||Our father's fallen ill with a strange disease.
   1032840|00000000||So we have brought this incense and entrust it to the Flame of the Eternal Fire.
   1032842|00000000||For only it has the power to heal the mortally ill.
    480688|00000000||Won't get in that way. Gotta find another.
   1043766|00000000||Oughta look among the villagers. Might find one brave enough to help me.
    504040|00000000||There he is! Get 'im! Explain to him exactly why it's a shite idea to cross Master Claytop!
    441243|00000000||Help me! Arrrgh!
    482418|00000000||Put it down, please… That's blood… Don't spill it… Please…
    482417|00000000||Stop… Go away… Don't do that… Leave it!
   1018954|00000000||Here's the wagon. Smell the cinnamon now?
   1018955|00000000||Aha. I was right about the warehouse.
   1001211|00000000||Try to get in through here.
   1001212|00000000||Lead the way.
    416620|00000000||Nooo…! Nooooo…!
    431715|00000000||Remember your last conversation with Dandelion?
    431669|00000000||These packages... Any chance they were trunks, travel cases? And this girl - possibly a trobairitz?
    431671|00000000||Yes, yes! Now I remember: she's a traveling performer, sailed in from Kovir… Talented family, innit?
    431673|00000000||Exceptionally. And very loving as well, I'm sure.
    431675|00000000||If you only knew! Dandelion even wrote a poem for her… "To My Dearest Callonetta," or somesuch. Oh, to have a brother like that!
    431869|00000000||Dandelion thinks you're a maid-servant.
    431873|00000000||I'm under the impression Dandelion thinks you still serve the la Valettes…
    431875|00000000||Oh, that's 'cause I never told him I stopped. Didn't want him to treat me any different…
    431879|00000000||And your husband has nothing against it... your old friendship?
    431881|00000000||Course not! Sweetiekins couldn't be happier that Dandelion's raisin' me sophistication.
    431749|00000000||Who do you favor, m'lady?
    431751|00000000||Can't decide between the black stallion and the gray mare. Keep goin' back and forth, back and forth.
    436398|00000000||Sorry. Don't believe we've been introduced.
    431753|00000000||I'm Geralt.
    431683|00000000||I'm Molly, m'lord. Wished to see me?
    431685|00000000||Call me Geralt.
    431857|00000000||Geralt? That Geralt? The one Dandelion's rescued time and time again?
    501463|00000000||That's right… except it's the other way around. I'm always saving him.
    501464|00000000||Mean to say it weren't Dandelion saved you in Flotsam by severin' your noose with an arrow from a hundred paces?
    501499|00000000||What? Dandelion couldn't… Er, never mind. Any idea where our master archer might be at the moment?
    431711|00000000||Actually, I'm always rescuing him.
    431709|00000000||Yeah… If not for him…
    501466|00000000||Mhm. Wouldn't be here if not for Dandelion.
    501467|00000000||Told me all about your adventures. How he'd ready you for battle with his songs, how he tamed the kayran by playin' his lute…
    501502|00000000||I meant that literally. Dandelion's why I'm here - came to ask you about him. Know where he might be?
    501504|00000000||No… sadly, I haven't got a clue. We've not seen each other in ages.
    431861|00000000||Ever since I became Lady la Attard, it's been nothin' but balls, banquets and other such… what's it… congregations. Awful tiring, all this…
    431859|00000000||The baroness don't approve of our acquaintance. Says Dandelion's a good-for-nothin' layabout - can you imagine?!
    436404|00000000||But… maybe his sister could help you? Such a nice girl…
    501616|00000000||Know where I can find her - Dandelion's sister?
    440477|00000000||Oh no. Whenever I asked Dandelion when we'd visit her, he'd grow all quiet, then change the subject.
    431867|00000000||You aware Dandelion doesn't have a sister?
    431721|00000000||Thanks, farewell.
    431837|00000000||Thanks, Molly.
    431839|00000000||Wait… before you go… I've got a request.
    431843|00000000||Dandelion told me once he'd show me his etchings, but he never did. And I'd so like to see 'em…
    431849|00000000||Won't be too hard to convince him. He loves showing off those etchings - to anyone he can.
    431851|00000000||Oh, that's wonderful! Thanks, and good luck to you on your search!
    431871|00000000||Thanks, farewell.
    431863|00000000||Remember your last conversation with Dandelion?
    431725|00000000||Any chance you remember your last conversation with Dandelion?
    497957|00000000||Course! He came to borrow some coin for a barge…
    497970|00000000||What? Why'd he need a barge?
    497971|00000000||To take me on a romantic cruise, of the canals, by the light of the moon!
    501530|00000000||Said there'd be strawberries and that wine with the bubbles, and he'd sing me arias… But… I've not seen him since.
    431719|00000000||Dandelion doesn't have a sister. You aware of that?
    431853|00000000||You do realize Dandelion doesn't have a sister.
    431855|00000000||Sure he does! Saw her meself! Funny, she don't look like him at all… blonde, for starters. Maybe they've different fathers?
    501612|00000000||Mhm. Different mothers, too.
    501614|00000000||Maybe… But you could see he cares for her, looks after her, the way he carried her packages and…
    432230|00000000||And here we are. Thank you for your company.
    432232|00000000||Likewise. See you.
    432222|00000000||Gladly. It's a long way to Novigrad. Road oughta seem shorter with some company.
    432224|00000000||I'd say the same. Well then, let's go.
    432218|00000000||Yeah, I'd like to go back.
    432226|00000000||No. Actually came to say goodbye. I'll get back on my own somehow.
    432228|00000000||As you will. In any case, I thank you for a pleasant afternoon.
    437220|00000000||No, thank you. Till next time.
    432220|00000000||Thanks, I'll head back on my own.
    432216|00000000||Ah, Geralt, there you are. Shall we return together?
    580320|00000000||Uh-huh?
    580322|00000000||Rubbish, rubbish.
   1064491|00000000||Witcher! At last. Now, we're all present…
   1064493|00000000||Mhm. And up the fucking creek. Why've you summoned us? Radovid's on his ship. We'll not get to him there, I've told you.
   1067585|00000000||Stop it. I've an idea how to draw him onto dry land.
   1067601|00000000||But all in due course. Let's start by confessing our sins. I let Philippa Eilhart in on our plan. Mea culpa.
   1067603|00000000||Bravo. Bloody braaavo.
   1067605|00000000||Now, now. It's not a disaster. The lady sorceress is highly unlikely to warn the brat. What's more, she's willing to help us kill him. Naturally, it's nothing I'll ever agree to... But Phil, she's inspired me. Call her my muse.
   1067587|00000000||Inspired you to do what?
   1067627|00000000||Patience. We've yet to get to the substance of the matter. Geralt… do I recall correctly that Radovid's hired you to find Philippa?
   1067629|00000000||You're nosy. It pisses me off.
   1067631|00000000||You're nosy. Starting to piss me off, you know?
   1067659|00000000||I know. Forgive me, it comes with the job.
   1067661|00000000||No. You're not a spy anymore, remember? Chose the life of a criminal.
   1067663|00000000||No, that choice was made for me. Philippa forced me to flee Redania. Radovid prevented me from returning.
   1067665|00000000||Dijkstra, infernally sad story, really fuckin' tugs at the heartstrings, but do you mind getting back to the matter at hand?
   1067667|00000000||Yes, right. Geralt, be so kind as to answer the question. He give you the contract or not?
   1067628|00000000||Sounds about right. What's your point?
   1064583|00000000||Mhm. But I wasn't interested.
   1067726|00000000||Good idea. I'll divide my men, post half on one end, other half on the other, by the gate. And in the middle, Ves with a well-oiled crossbow.
   1064631|00000000||I'm in… But once it's done. What then? There'll be an uproar in the city, panic maybe. Need a place where we can wait it out.
   1064633|00000000||Thought of that already. Remember Madame Irina's theater? Abandoned now, not a soul looks in there. Thaler and I will await you there.
   1067714|00000000||Await us? Unwilling to risk your own necks?
   1064635|00000000||Not the point. Dijkstra and I've many cocksuckin' virtues, but fightin' ability's just not one of them. About as fit for that as we are for a bleedin' beauty pageant.
   1064637|00000000||Don't worry, Geralt. My people're battle hardened. They'll manage. You just bring them the king.
   1067716|00000000||Do what I can. Where's his ship moored these days?
   1067762|00000000||Just round the corner, in Novigrad's port. And for your sake, I hope he's in a good mood when you look in on him.
   1064596|00000000||I'm in.
   1067718|00000000||No way. I'm out.
   1064610|00000000||No. Out of the question. If that's how you want to do it, I'm out.
   1064612|00000000||Geralt… Are you yellow?
   1064614|00000000||Gave it a thought, saw the light. Never should've gotten involved… Farewell, kingslayers.
   1064618|00000000||You know, it's just not something I'm willing to do.
   1064620|00000000||What? Geralt, what're you saying?
   1064622|00000000||Your plan - pretty damn risky. And I've got somebody to live for, I've got Ciri to find.
   1064624|00000000||Ciri's not the whole damn world.
   1064626|00000000||Speak for yourself.
   1064615|00000000||Not for me.
   1067728|00000000||You see, Geralt. All we ask is that you invite Radovid out for a stroll, bring him to the bridge. We'll take care of the rest. So what'll it be?
   1070837|00000000||Good idea. I'll divide my men, post half on one end, other half on the other, by the gate. And in the middle, someone with a well-oiled crossbow.
   1067720|00000000||Let's say Radovid bites, believes me, and none of that's a given… What then?
   1067722|00000000||You'll tell him you've found Philippa's hideout. Somewhere where we can easily set a trap, and ambush… Suggestions?
   1067724|00000000||Bridge to Temple Isle. Built up, both sides. Lots of nooks, gates. Easy to block off from the rest of the city.
   1067717|00000000||Let's say Radovid bites. What then?
   1067669|00000000||What's your point?
   1067671|00000000||We can use Philippa without involving her, provided you help.
   1067673|00000000||Radovid expects you to report to him, bring him information about her. All you need do is mention her name, intimate that you've a lead, you're on her trail…
   1064589|00000000||Oh, he'll swallow that. Hook, line, sinker and a good bit of the rod as well!
   1064581|00000000||Mhm. Only thing I've found is her hideout.
   1064483|00000000||Who's there?
   1064485|00000000||Witcher Geralt.
   1064487|00000000||Get in here.
   1064489|00000000||Boss awaits upstairs.
   1064629|00000000||Ugh, well, the prick just popped our pumpkin.
   1067772|00000000||Ploughing neutrality.
   1067764|00000000||The bridge must be clear.
   1067766|00000000||My lads'll make sure of that.
   1067768|00000000||Guards round the temple - what about them? Won't they bloody congregate when they see the fightin'?
   1067770|00000000||If they're paid a tidy sum, they won't.
   1074965|00000000||Will you bloody tell us what this is about?
   1074967|00000000||Just as soon as Geralt arrives. Should he arrive.
   1075419|00000000||If you won't ploughin' talk, least you can do is pour a round. Bloody suspense has made my throat dry.
   1049418|dfa72f66||Worker
    417697|00000000||It's terrifyin' here… It's too quiet.
    417699|00000000||Chop, chop. Speed up. Let's get this over with.
    444375|00000000||I remember the screams. Inhuman, they were. Now it's silent. They're dead, all dead.
    444377|00000000||Don't think about that. Keep walking.
   1012474|00000000||You're dandy.
   1012471|00000000||One relic meets another.
   1012469|00000000||Cheer up.
   1012467|00000000||I don't like it.
   1012465|00000000||You're dead already.
   1052397|00000000||How's business? All goes well?
   1052399|00000000||It goes. But I'm still in the red.
   1052401|00000000||The war, eh?
   1052403|00000000||Not exactly…
   1052405|00000000||Students had been buying all on credit for the last half year. They were to pay me next semester… then Radovid drove them out. And my gold with them!
   1087880|c385e52b||Ponce
   1065857|00000000||Secret room… Probably where Dandelion and his cohorts planned the heist.
    381402|00000000||What a dump… Looks more like a beggar's hovel than a margrave's townhouse.
    486749|00000000||Dandelion made some interesting friends…
    500983|00000000||Haha! Look at the redhead!
    500984|00000000||Go on, chase her! When a woman runs it means she wishes to be caught, desperately!
    448587|00000000||Fresh footprints. Johnny ran through here - fleeing something.
   1004299|00000000||Me man went to see the witch again…
   1004300|00000000||She's enchantin' 'em, I tell ye.
   1004301|00000000||Suckin' the life from their bodies!
   1004302|00000000||Since me husband went to her, all he does is sit outside, pick his teeth!
   1004303|00000000||Doe'n't help with anythin' anymore!
    515744|00000000||I don't know you, but-- Arghh! I thank you!
    515745|00000000||Introductions later!
    515746|00000000||Witcher! Why are you here?!
    515747|00000000||Tell you later!
   1032649|00000000||Half the crew didn't show again today.
   1032651|00000000||I wonder what excuse they'll dream up this time.
   1032653|00000000||Same as the last. Poisonin'… "Fit food goes to the troops, we're left with rotten fish."
   1032655|00000000||True, generally, but not with these blokes. Take a tour o' the taverns in Harborside, you'll see what's poisonin' 'em.
    384865|00000000||Ever fight a dragon?
    384875|00000000||Gonna kill the kikizmores?
    384861|00000000||Look! Look!
    384871|00000000||Don't know nothin'!
    384863|00000000||There ain't no kikizmores here!
    384867|00000000||Da!
    384869|00000000||Mum!
    384873|00000000||Is that… that an Undvik blade?
    572453|00000000||Pff! Got wetter when me kitty cried!
    572455|00000000||G'day!
    572457|00000000||What about ye?
    572459|00000000||Hey!
   1000593|00000000||No worries.
   1000599|00000000||No worries.
   1000595|00000000||General Voorhis?
   1000597|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! So I was not entirely mistaken.
   1000601|00000000||Hm, pleasure, as always. This is…
   1000609|00000000||A beautiful and mysterious lady. Let us leave the formalities to the event's end, when all will remove their masks.
   1000613|00000000||More fun that way, wouldn't you agree?
   1000615|00000000||I would, sir.
   1000611|00000000||And now I must beg your pardon - I really must find Derghoff, and quickly. A lovely evening to you both!
   1000592|00000000||General Voorhis?
    528476|00000000||Gregor, have you seen Derghoff? Just moments ago…
   1000591|00000000||Oh, apologies. I mistook you for my friend, sir. He wears a similar mask.
    467323|00000000||What do you want?
    467343|00000000||Name's Muggs, Rostan Muggs. Need your help in a grave matter.
    467319|00000000||How can I help?
    467353|00000000||What's this grave matter?
    467355|00000000||I came here on business. Sadly, just there across the river, toward the bridge's end, I was attacked.
    475762|00000000||Smashed a bottle of the finest dwarven spirit on the bugger's skull, but the robbery was still a partial success.
    467357|00000000||Tell me what you want already. And be brief.
   1038584|00000000||Thief ran off with me documents. Very important documents. I'd need you to get 'em back for me.
    467365|00000000||It'll cost you. I don't work for free.
    467367|00000000||That I know… Since the dawn o' time, no witcher's lifted a finger without pay. I've a smatterin' o' coin in the soles of me boots. Return the documents, and it's yours.
   1040518|00000000||Fine. See what I can do.
    467327|00000000||It'll cost you.
    467321|00000000||Not interested.
    475764|00000000||Sorry. You'll have to get someone else to help you.
    467361|00000000||Swarmy goatfucker! Here I tell you me troubles, trust you like a brother, and this is how you repay me?! A pox eat your stones!
    467363|00000000||And you think this is witchers' work because…?
    475766|00000000||Why wouldn't it be?
    475768|00000000||Well, not like your papers were stolen by a manticore or a drowner…
    467325|00000000||Sorry. I'm not a city watchman.
    467381|00000000||Here. Now pay up.
    467383|00000000||Of course I will! Give ye all I've left. Wouldnae have it any other way!
    467333|00000000||Got your documents.
   1072375|00000000||Seem really valuable to you, these papers. Think you oughta pay me more.
   1072377|00000000||More, but how? I ain't got more.
   1072373|00000000||Need more coin.
   1084354|00000000||Your documents - I'll try to find them.
    467385|00000000||All right. I'll see what I can do.
    467341|00000000||Don't have time for this now. So long.
    467331|00000000||So long.
    467329|00000000||I know who "robbed" you.
    467371|00000000||Found the thief who took your documents.
    467373|00000000||Ah, it can't be! Let's go get 'im! You can hold 'im while I take what's mine.
    467375|00000000||Slow down. See, this man said he never attacked you. Said you lost to him at cards.
    467377|00000000||Ach, cheeky bastard! But like me Aunt Rosalie always said, lies got but wee legs and don't run far.
    475770|00000000||The documents belong to me employer. A deed to a townhouse in Vengerberg. And true enough - I'd been drinkin'… got a bit carried away. And I lost 'em in a game o' cards.
    475772|00000000||Then you whacked the winner on the head with a bottle.
    475774|00000000||Wh-wh-what was I to do? He weren't willin' to give 'em back! When the scoundrel drew a weapon, I fled. But without them papers, I havenae the gumption to show me face at home.
    467345|00000000||Well?
   1053687|00000000||As soon as we find the laboratory, we will kick up our heels and live the high life.
   1053689|00000000||Tame that frown, Rian, I've tired of dungeons and dragons both.
   1053691|00000000||Dikker, you clod. I told you to watch where you place those boats of yours.
   1053693|00000000||These are elven ruins, there's a trap everywhere you step!
   1053695|00000000||Ahh… Hey, Maxi, are you certain this is the corridor?
    478609|00000000||Bravo! Jolly good stuff!
    491023|00000000||What you want?
    491024|00000000||Find yer own drinkin' 'ole.
   1073792|00000000||No, I don't.
   1073794|00000000||Here. Anyone asks, you didn't get it from me.
   1073796|00000000||Right. Thanks.
   1073799|00000000||Yeah, I got one.
   1073801|00000000||All right. Good luck.
   1073803|00000000||Thanks, see you.
   1066581|00000000||Let's talk. Must know why I'm here.
   1066583|00000000||Take it it's about our cobbler friend. Yeah, he came through here on his way out. Didn't come back, though.
   1066585|00000000||Patrol went out yesterday, reported an abandoned cart a ways off the road. Aimed to go out there, see if it's his. Couldn't get away.
   1066589|00000000||Thanks. Good enough to start with. Farewell.
   1073790|00000000||Hold on. You got a pass? Won't get back through without one.
   1066508|00000000||Down to business.
   1066509|00000000||Serve a king you despise?
   1066511|00000000||Seem to have lost all respect for the king. Why serve him?
   1066561|00000000||What'm I to do? I was born a Redanian, I won't desert.
   1066563|00000000||Besides, I enlisted when Vizimir was still on the throne. Now that was a good king, wise and just.
   1066579|00000000||Radovid's somethin' else. He's got war on the brain. And I don't want Redania to look anythin' like that.
   1066340|00000000||Nice job decorating your guard post.
   1066344|00000000||By orders of our gracious and merciful ruler, the good king…
   1066483|00000000||What was their crime?
   1066485|00000000||One on the right's a pellar from a village nearby. Gave some bloke the wrong advice, bloke's mates informed on him.
   1066513|00000000||Neighbor held a grudge against the one on the left. Accused him of witchcraft.
   1066505|00000000||Just humans at each others' throats. That's not Radovid's fault.
   1066507|00000000||Hm, who do you think set down the laws that mean folk hang for such "offences"?
   1064164|00000000||Looking for Gregor.
   1066315|00000000||You've found him. Who're you?
   1066317|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Dijkstra sent me.
   1066333|00000000||Been expectin' someone. Let's take a walk.
    471800|00000000||Claw marks… Deep…
    593051|00000000||This is getting interesting…
    592990|00000000||[Step away.]
    592989|00000000||[Inspect corpse.]
    592992|00000000||Hmm. Cuts… made with long claws. Flesh torn clear off.
    471802|00000000||Hmm, no man did this…
    471804|00000000||Tuft of fur… Ugh, whatever lost it hasn't bathed in a while.
    471806|00000000||Mff… Smell of a rotting corpse. Blood spattered all around.
    471812|00000000||Werewolf - no doubt about it. Gotta be careful.
    486052|00000000||Must be Hanna… Torn to pieces, literally…
    551700|00000000||Blood, and paw marks… Wonder where they lead…
    560668|00000000||Man's clothes - shredded, but no sign of blood.
    592179|00000000||Who rips their own clothes off, leaves 'em in the woods?
    560930|00000000||Sorry it had to end this way…
    561706|00000000||Looks like a hunter's quarters.
    561845|00000000||Notes… Wonder whose…
    567492|00000000||Hmm…Must've climbed this… Should look around some more.
    586726|00000000||Shit, climbed the tree. I can't get up there.
    592187|00000000||Maybe find something else on the ground.
   1055415|00000000||Hm, blood's just barely dried. He was dragged here. Wonder where from.
   1055585|00000000||Hmm… Where was I?
    414072|00000000||There it goes - pffft!
   1021382|00000000||Greetings.
   1021384|00000000||Don't scare me young'uns.
   1021386|00000000||What?
   1021388|00000000||Children! Gather 'round!
   1023332|00000000||I heard that, too!
   1021390|00000000||Oh no.
   1021392|00000000||Where're my young'uns?! Aaargh!
   1021394|00000000||Eh, swine.
   1023330|00000000||And Vizima… Vizima they're to raze!
   1023334|00000000||Then plant cabbage where our capital now stands…
   1021398|00000000||Once Nilfgaard arrives here, where'll we flee to?
   1021396|00000000||Black Ones took Vizima, they'll take Novigrad, too.
   1021400|00000000||My regards!
    429743|00000000||Then I chased the pansy all the way to the garden!
    430653|00000000||Did you catch 'im?
    429745|00000000||No luck! Writhin' and slippery the bugger was, quick as a tomcat. Scrambled out the hole in the back wall.
    497321|00000000||Sounds like he might've been an acrobat…
    497322|00000000||Maybe so. Both misses are fond of freaks…
    560903|00000000||Argh, loads o' misfortune, loads… Some horror took Hanna first, now they found Margaret and Niellen dead…
    592261|00000000||Shame, that. The was good folk.
   1058579|00000000||Don't know they were that good. No such thing as good folk these days. What ye have's folk who manage to get away with things.
    560900|00000000||She were a good girl… Shame she's gone…
    560901|00000000||You blame her? Lost her sister, then her sister's man, parents died long past…
    592315|00000000||She did well to go. Be better off elsewhere. Find joy, maybe.
   1058300|00000000||Ye hear? They found Margaret in the woods, bloody somethin' awful, torn to shreds. Some beast must've nabbed her…
   1058302|00000000||Aye, heard folk talkin'. She must've happened on wolves… But Niellen, that's who I feel for.
   1058557|00000000||Horrors o' some sort took his wife, now her sister… Got none left to him in this world…
   1058559|00000000||True. No wonder the lad up and left. Might could find solace elsewhere.
    586162|00000000||Daddy, will Aunt Hanna visit today?
    592266|00000000||No… She'll not, child…
    586160|00000000||Why? Where is she?
    592268|00000000||Argh, if only I knew…
    586167|00000000||She's such a good lass. Find her, please…
    586169|00000000||All right. Forgin' and hammerin' won't do itself.
   1013918|00000000||You want something?
   1013916|00000000||Ah, humans.
   1013910|00000000||Ahh...
    416491|00000000||I must live... I must...
    416493|00000000||You shall perish...
    416489|00000000||I shall live... Live... Live... Live...
    472921|00000000||Da! Da! Strangers!
    472925|00000000||Da! A stranger! Saw him over there!
    472929|00000000||Strangers comin'! Run for your lives!
    472931|00000000||Jacko! Hanna! Go home, now!
    473906|00000000||The baron's men approach, sir. Leave while you can.
    571589|00000000||What's the meaning of this! Such rudeness and vulgarity!
   1040318|00000000||Young people these days!
    398907|00000000||Miss… Cow's a-wheezin', won't rise from the barn floor. Pus streams from 'er snout.
    170308|00000000||Do I look like a dairy maid to you?
    353920|00000000||No, miss, but you know things. 'Tis our last cow, none other left in the village…
    170310|00000000||Rest died of hunger, or soldiers led 'em off. Oh… we're as good as dead without her.
    353924|00000000||I shall give you herbs. Mix them with water drawn from the spring at midnight, then make the cow drink them. But first you must clean out your barn. Thoroughly, is that clear?
    414085|00000000||Thank you, miss! A thousand thanks!
    372682|00000000||Enough! I've had my fill for the day - go home!
   1113286|e5a3b8da||Traveler
   1055174|7d719e1d||White Mouse
   1049338|00000000||A pleasure doin' business with you. But next time…
   1049340|00000000||Try and be more careful undressing the stiffs. A coat's tough to sell when it's got blood all over the marten fur collar…
   1049342|00000000||I save bein' gentle for when I diddle your mum's twat.
   1049344|00000000||If you don't want it, the baron's men'll buy it.
    580184|00000000||Yes, kind sir?
    580186|00000000||Don't look back in anger!
   1046396|00000000||Tell me whatcha want, dammit!
   1046398|00000000||Placards.
   1046400|00000000||There ain't no ploughin' placards here!
   1047718|00000000||And Rautlec? Where's he?
   1047720|00000000||Same place as always - Vegelbud estate. Losin' his last crowns at the races!
   1046402|00000000||See, wasn't that easy? Coulda said so right away…
   1046380|00000000||Don't know how much Rautlec owes you, but everythin' in this house is mine!
   1046382|00000000||Want to get somethin' back? Try the Vegelbud estate - Rautlec's losin' his last crowns at the races, I wager. Now get the hell out of here!
    446688|00000000||You wander this gods forsaken isle all you want. But if you're not bound for the tower, I'll wait here.
   1055083|445c61e2||Maiden
    499427|00000000||Jorre, ye dimwit! Drop one more and I'll keelhaul you!
    503067|00000000||Got a minute?
    503069|00000000||Preparin' my boat, can't ye see? Nilfgaardian dogs - we're to hunt us some!
    503071|00000000||Got bigger game in mind. Morkvarg.
    503080|00000000||Aaah, so them's your apples. All right, ask away. In praise of Freya…
    499436|00000000||The garden - what happened there?
    499454|00000000||You were there when Morkvarg raided the garden. Heard you alone survived.
    499458|00000000||True. I managed to flee. Great Mother was lookin' out for me that day.
    503090|00000000||Mhm. But she didn't give a lick about the priestesses.
    503094|00000000||Apparently… Morkvarg had them bound, then slit their throats like horses for the sacrifice. And he laughed. Understand? He laughed.
    503103|00000000||But Archpriestess Ulve cursed him with her dying breath. "You are beastly now - remain so for evermore!" Ahh, saintly woman!
    503123|00000000||What happened to Morkvarg?
    503181|00000000||What happened to Morkvarg?
    503212|00000000||Hard to believe, but fur rose through his skin, and his mug stretched forth into a muzzle, like a dog's or a wolf's. He howled, long and grieving, then lunged at his men.
    503222|00000000||They tried to run, but he was fast as lightnin'. As he killed them, clamped his jaws round their throats, they turned to ash - just like that! Ash that seeped from 'twixt his fangs.
    503877|00000000||Not good. Curse must be complex, multi-leveled.
    503879|00000000||Such is the Great Mother's power.
    503124|00000000||Didn't help the priestesses?
    503158|00000000||Didn't help the priestesses? Why not?
    503160|00000000||How could I? Alone against a dozen raiders that-- Why you starin'?
    503173|00000000||Just wondering. You people - obsessed with honor, courage and so on… But you just cut and run? Strange.
    503179|00000000||I ain't proud of it.
    509795|00000000||Since that day, I been seekin' a worthy death at sea. Seems the goddess, she's not seen fit to summon me. Yet.
    499451|00000000||Farewell.
    503218|00000000||See you.
    503088|00000000||Goddess guide your sword.
    503220|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    503125|00000000||Thanks.
    503122|00000000||Liar.
    503258|00000000||Liar.
    499630|00000000||We don't need to fight.
    499635|00000000||I'm no knight errant, I'm a witcher. Didn't come here to bring you to justice.
    503458|00000000||Diggin' up the past - what's that for?
    503460|00000000||Need to know what actually happened in the garden. Gonna lift Morkvarg's curse.
    503374|00000000||Why would you bloody do that? Whoreson should suffer till Ragh nar Roog - the day after, actually!
    503478|00000000||It's what I do.
    503497|00000000||Used to say the same myself… till Morkvarg gave the order to sail for Hindarsfjall.
    503470|00000000||Lift curses - that's what I do.
    503468|00000000||Couldn't care less what you think.
    503493|00000000||Might surprise you, but I couldn’t care less what a lying murderer has to say.
    503495|00000000||Compared to Morkvarg, I'm a ploughin' saint.
    503498|00000000||I've raided often and cruelly, killed women, children, whatever my axe happened to hit. But priestesses? It was too much, even for me.
    503514|00000000||When… when it was over, and Morkvarg was drinkin' with the rest, I took this out.
    505030|00000000||Wolf fang pendant… covered in runes.
    504907|00000000||I got it from my da, who was godi of our village. Told me that anyone I cut with the fang would suffer a fate worse than death. Spoke true, it seems.
    503544|00000000||Your pop-pop mention how to reverse this?
    503546|00000000||Victim needs to get the fang, is all. But I'll not give it to you. That whoreson should suffer.
    503594|00000000||Listen, the priestesses? They really long to get their garden back. And as I see it, you owe them, don't you think?
    503600|00000000||All right, take it. But it don't come free - want one thing in return.
    503637|00000000||Won't tell anyone about your past. Give you my word.
    503639|00000000||Not that. If you do, I'll just find you and kill you.
    503641|00000000||Once Morkvarg's human again - you can't let him leave. No matter what.
    503547|00000000||Do it for the priestesses.
    503548|00000000||Hand it over.
    503587|00000000||I'll take the fang. You can either hand it over or…
    503589|00000000||Word of advice - never threaten a Skellige warrior. Especially one's got command of a longship.
    499631|00000000||Can't wait.
    499632|00000000||You're daft. You're alone. What's your plan, eh?
    503322|00000000||Lemme show you.
    499628|00000000||Meet them gladly.
    503326|00000000||What? I swear it on the Great Mother's tits--
    503328|00000000||Cut the act. Don't buy your piety one bit. You were one of Morkvarg's men.
    503330|00000000||Well, well. Sharp y'are… Didn't see one thing, though.
    503333|00000000||Lads here around me - they're mine. Armed to the teeth to the man. Let me introduce yous.
    499491|00000000||Liar.
    499453|00000000||Lied to me.
    499422|00000000||Greetings. Praise Freya.
    503591|00000000||Go on, lads! One to kill him gets his swords!
    459153|00000000||That's what happened. Told you true.
    395697|00000000||What happened to the ashen-haired woman?
    395705|00000000||What happened to the woman?
    395707|00000000||Fuck if I know…
    459151|00000000||One of the boys - got her in the back… But she's alive, I swear it!
    547180|00000000||Dudu - what happened to him?
    547182|00000000||Dudu - what happened to him?
    547184|00000000||I don't fucking know… Prick vanished!
    548840|00000000||There one moment, gone the next…
    395703|00000000||Is that all?
    443693|00000000||Got anything else to say?
    443695|00000000||I've told you all I know! Everything…
    443697|00000000||You hurt the woman I'm looking for… You tortured her friend.
    443703|00000000||She attacked me! I've a right to defend myself!
    443705|00000000||I beg you… Got what I deserved… Have mercy… Please…
    433128|00000000||Lemme tell you where things stand.
    459315|00000000||I'm looking for this woman, 'cause she's like a daughter to me.
    459317|00000000||And that's why I just can't let this go.
    433130|00000000||Nooooo!
    395639|00000000||You gotta die.
    395653|00000000||I'm no executioner.
    427760|00000000||Thank you… I'll make it up to you, I will… This is my city, and--
    443684|00000000||Shut up.
    443687|00000000||Know what? Gotta wonder what your friends from the Big Four'll say when they find out you're working for Radovid…
    443689|00000000||Hey! Wait! What're you saying?
    459313|00000000||Waaait!
    395641|00000000||Refuse to sully myself with your blood.
   1004170|00000000||Then both forces attacked, one from either side…
   1004171|00000000||Cavalry swooped in from the wood, a wall of infantry marched from the swamp. Our boys wished to surrender…
   1004172|00000000||…but the Black Ones would take no prisoners.
   1004173|00000000||They gathered our men, stood 'em in a circle… and cut down every last one like the butchers they were.
   1004174|00000000||Poppies cover the meadow now. Or perhaps they're kingcups, drunk on blood from the soil.
   1052475|00000000||Played at Whoreson's den lately?
   1052477|00000000||Stopped goin' there after they sol' me dirty fisstech.
   1052479|00000000||That's good. Word is Wiley's fallen out with the rest o' the Big Four.
   1052481|00000000||Goin' all in, then… Damned foolish bet.
   1052483|00000000||Not if he's got a daft high card up his sleeve…
   1000919|00000000||Nobility's naught to us, young count. Try anything and you will get bruised.
   1000917|00000000||Hm, doubt it.
   1000832|00000000||Albert Vegelbud?
   1000833|00000000||Please step away, miss.
   1000829|00000000||Here you are! So, about this private showing…
   1000830|00000000||Under any other circumstances I'd give you the full monty.
   1000831|00000000||Oh. I'm sorry, I…
    495929|00000000||Lemme be!
    495930|00000000||Enough! Stop it!
    495928|00000000||Begone! Get!
   1062240|00000000||Think I can't hear you? I hear you fine.
   1062242|00000000||You lookin' to ambush me? I'll not let you. Won't trick me, oh no.
   1062238|00000000||Oh no you don't… I can see yous lyin' low'. You don't fool me.
    424244|00000000||Va fail.
    424240|00000000||Farewell.
    424238|00000000||What're you offering?
    424242|00000000||Show me what you're willing to sell.
    424252|00000000||Que?
   1038081|00000000||Apiarian phantom, my ass! Hound of the Wild Hunt. How the hell did it end up here?
   1038164|00000000||Roach'll run you down.
   1038303|00000000||Dammit. Lost it.
    523776|00000000||Out of my way.
    524042|00000000||Move.
    524043|00000000||No, sorry. We talked, it was amusin', now about face and forward march.
    529407|00000000||Gonna walk in the camp now.
    529408|00000000||Aye, naturally.
    529427|00000000||And you're gonna go look for hornbills.
    529428|00000000||Aye, I'm goin', indeed.
    529311|00000000||You'll let me in. Now.
    529429|00000000||I get it. You're the local funny man.
    529430|00000000||What was that?
    533216|00000000||Funny? How you mean that?
    529312|00000000||Gotta admit, I am amused.
    486287|00000000||You blind, Hortensio? That's Geralt, old friend of mine.
    533204|00000000||Come in, Geralt.
    524048|00000000||I see. And behind you - that's a berry pickers' camp?
    524049|00000000||We're, uh… birdwatchers.
    527917|00000000||Lemme guess: that sword's in case you run into a hornbill?
    527918|00000000||No. Hornbills aren't endemic to this area. Don't migrate here, either.
    523775|00000000||What do you do here?
    486285|00000000||Lookin' for Roche.
    486286|00000000||No one here by that name.
    497001|00000000||Anythin' else?
    461003|00000000||Gotta pass yet? Don't be botherin' me if you don't!
    460891|00000000||Turn back. Bridge is closed.
    460893|00000000||On whose orders?
    460895|00000000||By order of His Grace, King Radovid himself. Which means I'm not to let me own mum through without a valid pass.
    460863|00000000||How do I get a pass?
    460869|00000000||Listen, how do I get a pass?
    460873|00000000||You've got to have important state business the other side. Then you'd get one.
   1033216|00000000||How much I gotta pay to have important state business?
   1033218|00000000||No need to be clever, witcher. Just gotta know the right people.
    460875|00000000||Which ones are they?
   1033219|00000000||Someone from the new regime'd be best. Or maybe… you know Albin Hart's brother-in-law?
   1033633|00000000||Who?
   1033634|00000000||Ehh, never mind.
    460871|00000000||Guess that means I'm done here.
    460867|00000000||Farewell.
    460865|00000000||Got a pass.
    460879|00000000||Mhm. I've got a pass.
    460881|00000000||Hmm… let's see…
    461058|00000000||Everything looks to be in order.
    460883|00000000||All right, let me cross.
    460885|00000000||Are you in a rush? Got somethin' concealed, maybe?
    460887|00000000||Wanna frisk me?
    460889|00000000||Hah! What? You out for a fondlin'? We've no time for games, witcher. Lads, let 'im through!
    433148|00000000||Yield, or end like your brother.
    433150|00000000||Never!
    452889|c5cf51e4||Old Sage
   1064184|00000000||O yoooooo!
   1067527|00000000||Fu… Cu… Cuckfunt!
   1067529|00000000||Heheh, didn't I say you were a moron, Ogg?
   1067531|00000000||Told you a hundred times - "fucking cunt." Not bloody "cuckfunt!"
   1073811|00000000||Ogg angergets! Ogg hitmake! Diemake!
   1064186|00000000||Infernal fuckin' mess. We should sod off.
   1067533|00000000||Diekill… Cu… Cucky!
   1067535|00000000||Fuck me, Ogg, you're never gonna get it.
   1073813|00000000||Ogg bigforce! Cobbleringer in gosoup!
   1067782|00000000||Rooogg! Here comes! Helps Rogg!
   1074399|42d828d0||Cultist
    382204|00000000||Dopplers to the stake! Burn 'em all!
    381795|00000000||Tear me a new one?! We'll see about that! On your feet, boys! Give 'em a taste o' hell - in the name o' the Church!
    381797|00000000||Give us a hand, witcher! Can't take 'em on our own!
    381791|00000000||Take more than threats to keep us quiet!
    381793|00000000||S'all right. I'll try me knuckledusters. Come here!
    381732|00000000||He's right! Oy, mummers! Don't know the Eternal Fire's commandments?
    383731|00000000||Blasphemers! Oughta teach them respect for the faith!
    381734|00000000||What you on about! Shut the fuck up and clap, afore I tear you new arseholes.
    381789|00000000||Give it a rest, mate. Can't you see it's all in fun?
    383733|00000000||It's a comedy - a ghoul could play the prince. Lighten up, for gods' sake.
    182528|00000000||Witcher! Your task is a matter most tender.
    182530|00000000||A monster shall show at tonight's feastly splendor.
    182532|00000000||Stand guard, beware, kill the beast if he shows...
    367962|00000000||Majesty! The monster slayer awaits! Your summons he's answered and stands at the gates!
    367964|00000000||Show him in, I must speak to the man.
    367979|00000000||And a grateful queen shall reward your woes.
    341218|00000000||To slay beasts most foul...
    182585|00000000||To slay beasts most foul - 'twas for this I was made,
    182587|00000000||I kill as my calling, not just to get paid.
    367996|00000000||But a fiend and a maid? No, this must cease.
    367998|00000000||Though at least, ere he goes, he'll enjoy a last feast!
    182600|00000000||He's swallowed the bait, this fool of a witcher!
    182602|00000000||I'll ensure the foul beau reveals his true figure.
    182604|00000000||The monster revealed, the witcher shall strike,
    182606|00000000||the beast will he slay, thrust his head on a pike!
    182608|00000000||Ah... My child will pity her love, this beast.
    182549|00000000||I kill monsters for pleasure... And…
    182598|00000000||And... No man is my measure…
    341216|00000000||I kill monsters for pleasure...
    367981|00000000||Your reward you'll receive on my finest pillows.
    367977|00000000||But first - some wine - to steady my hand.
    367975|00000000||Lest that dread beast take my daughter's hand.
    182650|00000000||My dear! Long have we hid our love's tender fires.
    368014|00000000||Months we've restrained our loins' hot desires!
    368016|00000000||In stealth we'd meet, in deceit, like liars.
    368018|00000000||Tonight shall it end - be my wife, that's my plea!
    182652|00000000||That having said - I'll get down on my knee.
    182654|00000000||Our hearts' torment over, we shall love for centuries!
    182656|00000000||Oh, darling, I will, I will, I will!
    394056|00000000||And then I shall pluck your ripe virginity!
    394052|00000000||Tonight shall it end - Be my wife, that's my plea!
    394042|00000000||Months I held back my loins' hot desires!
    394038|00000000||My dear! Long have we -hic- hid our love's tender fires.
    394040|00000000||In stealth we'd kiss… uh… deceitful, like liars.
    394054|00000000||Our hearts' torment over, we shall love for centuries!
    182658|00000000||Oh, darling, I will, I will, I will!
    182660|00000000||Wait! With wine must we toast this moment joyful.
    182664|00000000||If not, a foul curse shall rend your lives woeful.
    394062|00000000||Argh! 'Tis not wine… but a brew spiked with silver!
    394066|00000000||My bowels contract, a foul beast to deliver!
    394064|00000000||Soon all shall see my true monstrous figure!
    368024|00000000||Hark! Hark! 'Tis no prince, but a doppler impostor!
    182670|00000000||Soon all shall see my true monstrous figure!
    394060|00000000||Treason! 'Tis not wine, but a brew spiked with silver!
    182668|00000000||My bowels contract, a foul beast to deliver!
    368026|00000000||If the maid loves him... It seems we've lost her…
    368028|00000000||Seems men's hearts can love for changelings foster!
    182674|00000000||Behold, witcher, the beast of which I spoke!
    182676|00000000||Unleash your sword! Let fly the killing stroke!
    182696|00000000||Stop! Stop! Beast or man, 'tis my love, my betrothed!
    182698|00000000||Sheathe your blades! Fear a doppler? 'Tis a thing most foolish.
    182700|00000000||Changing one's shape does not make one ghoulish.
    182702|00000000||Remember! 'Tis not flesh a monster makes…
    182715|00000000||But a lack of morals... And a surfeit of cakes…
    182708|00000000||But a heart that is base, such as in this knave aches!
    396633|00000000||But a base heart…
    182717|00000000||Witcher, 'tis true! This wretch's foul suspicions…
    182719|00000000||…tainted my mind with this plan so malicious.
    182721|00000000||The doppler must live, my daughter he'll wed.
    182723|00000000||Beast or man, she loves him truly, without dread.
    182731|00000000||Tis our tale's end, good folk, and it's moral is this…
    182752|00000000||No monster is he whose shape can shift.
    182754|00000000||Show love for dopplers... As well as for fish.
    396657|00000000||Show love for the dopplers...
    182756|00000000||The witcher is just - a true doppler's friend.
    182768|00000000||But you, foul page, in chains you shall end.
    182772|00000000||Guard! Call the guard! Remove the traitor at once!
    182770|00000000||Guard! Call the guard! Remove the traitor at once!
    182694|00000000||Stop! Stop! Beast or man, 'tis my love, my betrothed!
    396621|00000000||Seems men's hearts...
    396637|00000000||But a base heart…
    396649|00000000||Show love for the dopplers...
    396647|00000000||No monster is he...
    396635|00000000||But a lack of morals…
    396625|00000000||Seems men's hearts...
    396623|00000000||If the maid loves him...
    396641|00000000||But a heart that is base…
    396639|00000000||But a lack of morals…
    182742|00000000||No monster is he...
    182744|00000000||Show love for the dopplers...
    332049|00000000||Hey! Hear the princess' command? Come up here!
    332051|00000000||Come on then, guv'nor! Up you go! On stage!
    332053|00000000||Toss the traitor scum in the dungeon!
    332055|00000000||Don't be afraid. In the end, everyone'll live happily ever after.
    337566|00000000||Doppler and princess wed the same night.
    337568|00000000||The servant's heart melted, he wept at the sight.
    396653|00000000||Show love for the dopplers...
    396651|00000000||No monster is he...
    396655|00000000||No monster is he...
    182706|00000000||But a base heart…
    182704|00000000||But a lack of morals…
    396631|00000000||But a lack of morals…
    396615|00000000||If the maid loves him...
    396617|00000000||Seems men's hearts...
    396613|00000000||Seems men's hearts...
    396611|00000000||If the maid loves him...
    396619|00000000||If the maid loves him...
    341228|00000000||Hey! Hear the princess' command? Come up here!
    341230|00000000||Come on then, guv'nor! Up you go! On stage!
    341232|00000000||Toss the traitor scum in the dungeon!
    341234|00000000||Don't be afraid. Everyone lives happily ever after in the end.
    341236|00000000||Doppler and princess wed the same night.
    341238|00000000||The servant's heart melted, he wept at the sight.
    367994|00000000||Maybe he's hid...
    368000|00000000||Maybe he hid... In the cellar... Or a barrel of beer.
    368002|00000000||Perhaps 'midst the guests he hides, in fear?
    367992|00000000||Perhaps 'midst the guests…
    367986|00000000||Gathered are we, a host fair and noble,
    367988|00000000||to celebrate this day the princess's betrothal!
    367990|00000000||Alas, no monster do I see or hear...
    432971|00000000||Thank you, witcher.
    477021|00000000||Bloody elves. They'd invent any excuse to rob me.
    477023|00000000||Please, take this - a sign of my gratitude.
    379750|00000000||Maybe he meant this bottle...
   1054317|00000000||My regards to a true professional.
    497714|00000000||I'll cover half the space, you take the other half. Look for evidence of rat activity.
    498574|00000000||Mhm… Thing is, I know what evidence of manticore activity looks like, but rodents…?
    498578|00000000||Geralt, we'd both rather be somewhere else. I'd rather be sitting in a royal council meeting, but they killed my king.
    501312|00000000||Look for crevices… And droppings…
   1063330|00000000||Once we place this incense, what then?
   1063332|00000000||I'll cast a spell and the rats will leave.
   1063334|00000000||Can't do that without sprinkling incense? Don't really feel up to looking for rat shit.
   1063336|00000000||Stop whining!
   1033047|00000000||Reinforcements! I'll handle them!
   1033046|00000000||They're trying to surround us! They're mine!
   1034934|00000000||Shoot at will!
   1044056|00000000||"Full Armor of the 7th Daerlan Brigade." Excellent condition.
    444254|85f9c72d||Succubus
    449947|00000000||You… so, ye still alive? Y-ye sure there's naught wrong with ye?
    385160|00000000||Still sniffin' 'round here, are ye?
    416279|00000000||Greetings.
    385164|00000000||I met your "Ladies."
    385168|00000000||Met your "Ladies" - and I think "Crones" is more fitting as a name for those monstrosities.
    405930|00000000||Why d'ya say that?
    405932|00000000||Just the look of them - hideous monsters clad in human robes and skin.
    405934|00000000||Fisstech must addle your city folks' brains. I ain't seen all the Ladies, true, but the Whispess, she's shown herself. A true beauty, that 'un.
    461343|00000000||Tree said the Crones are evil.
    416273|00000000||Tree said the Crones are evil.
    416275|00000000||Examined the Whispering Hillock.
    416277|00000000||Thought you'd not return… What did ye learn?
    416329|00000000||Your Ladies of the Wood are three murderous sisters.
    416331|00000000||Lies! Foul lies! Speak not so 'fore you bring their wrath upon us.
    416333|00000000||The Crones tricked you.
    416337|00000000||The Crones - they've tricked you, they manipulate you.
    416339|00000000||Ye been told cruel lies, witcher. I beg ye, don't believe them.
    416335|00000000||Why do you trust Crones?
    416341|00000000||You trust women you've never even seen? Why?
    416343|00000000||Ere the evil took root on the hillock, the Ladies always helped us. Healthy babes were born. And once a year we got a giant pot of boiled meat.
    416398|00000000||Once a year, that's it?
    416400|00000000||At the time of the feast, the Ladies of the Wood give us the scrapings from their table.
    416396|00000000||We'll never see eye to eye.
    416402|00000000||Can see we'll never agree on this.
    416404|00000000||Now here's what interests me - who caused such hatred towards our guardians to grow in ye, witcher? Why d'ye trust such a one, and not me?
    416422|00000000||You've served those murdering hags faithfully for years. Set out to destroy the forest, clear the hill of trees.
    416424|00000000||Aye. I'll not deny it. The Ladies commanded it - but we failed them.
    416426|00000000||Egh, if there be a tortured soul beneath that hillock, callin' for justice, we'll answer its cries. But in mine eyes, 'tis not justice it yearns for but blood.
    420686|00000000||Don't blabber to me 'bout guilt and punishment. In my reckonin', somethin' wants our lives, but we're not keen on dyin'. And that's all in your hands.
    412833|00000000||Who are the Ladies of the Wood?
    396573|00000000||Others call them the Crones, but you call them the Ladies of the Wood.
    396575|00000000||Those who name them Crones, them's heartless fools. The Ladies of the Wood have watched o'er this land for ages.
    396577|00000000||In what way?
    396579|00000000||They drive out evil powers. They say a hundred springs ago, they saved Velen from a plague of werewolves ravaging our flocks.
    385166|00000000||Farewell.
    385174|00000000||Good health to you. Farewell.
    449955|00000000||So long, ealdorman.
    449953|00000000||Farewell.
    449951|00000000||What happened here?
    449957|00000000||Where is everybody? What happened here?
    449959|00000000||Ain't no everybody. Everybody cut everybody else down. Brother lunged at brother, son at father…
   1059822|00000000||What… what are you saying?
   1059824|00000000||A black mare came. Reared up o'er there, by that hut, and… then the madness started. Took ahold o' folk. Mothers carryin' babes suddenly smashed 'em against stumps, and…
   1059826|00000000||The horror… Me tongue don't wanna say what my eyes've seen… and me mind hopes to forget.
    449949|00000000||Ye'd best not come 'round here no more. Whole place ought to sink into the earth.
   1009299|00000000||Ahh... Should've built a roof…
   1009296|00000000||Mm-hm...
   1009287|00000000||No offense, but, uh, you're scaring my customers away.
   1009294|00000000||Care for a nibble?
   1009285|00000000||A beverage, maybe?
   1009291|00000000||Hungry or stupid?
   1009289|00000000||Don't hit the cook!
   1045665|00000000||Bet you're sweaty in all that armor…
   1045667|00000000||Why you care?
   1045669|00000000||Wouldn't you rather sweat on me?
   1011622|00000000||The Ripper! Aaah!
   1011620|00000000||At least this one bathes.
   1011618|00000000||Hey, I'm available.
   1011616|00000000||Gotta pay for looking, too.
   1011614|00000000||That's just over my whore's head.
   1012056|00000000||Ugh...
   1012054|00000000||Farewell.
   1012046|00000000||How are you?
   1012042|00000000||*Ptooey* A witcher? Here?!
   1012040|00000000||Hm?
   1012038|00000000||What a yokel!
   1012036|00000000||Rain…
    454016|00000000||Vodka's gone… as are the troubadours… and my things. Dammit!
   1013770|00000000||Fine. When?
   1013772|00000000||After dark, o' course. See ye there.
    539965|00000000||Greetings.
    539966|00000000||Oh, Geralt. How are things?
   1043685|00000000||Hattori's got a job for us.
   1043687|00000000||Great, I was startin' to get bored.
   1043689|00000000||Wants us to ”borrow” a few crates from Ernst van Hoorn's warehouse. They'll smell of ammonia.
   1043691|00000000||Hm, sounds doable. I know where van Hoorn stores his goods. The boys and I, we'll go there, look around. Meet us near the Sturgeon.
    539968|00000000||When do we meet?
    539969|00000000||Got something to do first.
    539970|00000000||Don't have time now. Need to do something.
   1074581|00000000||Not now. Come see me after dusk.
    539971|00000000||All right. Be that as it may, me and the boys'll look around. See ye there later.
   1053723|00000000||My servant caught some rag picker rifling through our rubbish yesterday. Can you believe it?
   1053725|00000000||Rabble from Velen's come pouring into the city. That is the inevitable result…
   1053727|00000000||Why does the Temple Guard do nothing about it? They should toss them out by their coattails!
   1053735|00000000||The Guard has other things on its mind. They chase mages now, left us to fend for ourselves.
   1053737|00000000||Alas, it's always the decent folk who must struggle.
    343485|c25a166e||Anabelle
   1053089|00000000||Eeeee!
   1053091|00000000||I shall sssssavor your death.
   1053093|00000000||Ahh…
   1049376|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, got it right?
   1051521|00000000||What do you want?
   1049378|00000000||To express my admiration on account o' your victory. And here - brought you an invitation from the boss. He'd like to congratulate you personally.
   1051523|00000000||Farewell.
    515596|00000000||What do they call you? Know how to fight?
    515597|00000000||Geralt. And yes.
    540137|00000000||Hah. Then enter the lists, my friend!
    515606|00000000||I'm ready. Let's fight.
    515607|00000000||Good folk! Fishgulper's finally found a foe! Right here, right now, on the field of honor, he'll face none other than Geralt of Rivia, the, uh… Hammer!
    515639|00000000||No chance.
    515642|00000000||Not about to lose on purpose. If you wanna win, you gotta beat me.
    515640|00000000||All right. So be it.
    515638|00000000||All right.
    515636|00000000||Cut o' your mug's plain as day. What'm I beside ye? I just wanna live… These days streams're bereft, no fish for me to gulp… and they's givin' a sack o' flour to the winner.
    515637|00000000||Show some pity. Take a fall for me.
    515668|00000000||Spare me a minute 'fore the fight, master? Please…
   1075488|00000000||Let's do this, let's fight.
    540521|00000000||Geralt the Hammer versus Fishgulper! The rematch!
    515598|00000000||I'm ready.
    515601|00000000||Thanks, some other time, maybe.
    515600|00000000||So long.
    540507|00000000||So, will you try again?
    569599|00000000||Be a good little hunter and gimme the crystal.
    569600|00000000||I am a good little hunter. There you go.
    569597|00000000||Behave and gimme the crystal.
    569601|00000000||No time to argue. Gimme the crystal.
    569602|00000000||Over my dead body!
    589365|00000000||Have it your way…
    569598|00000000||Gimme the crystal or you're in for a world of hurt.
    589335|00000000||All right, let's get you out of here.
    589395|00000000||Told you already - no chance.
    589346|00000000||Besides… The teleport's power cell - I broke it off. We've to wait till they come for us, got no choice.
    589347|00000000||Nobody's gonna come for us. Gimme the crystal, I'll get us out of here.
    589350|00000000||But the monsters…
    589351|00000000||I'll defend you.
    589358|00000000||What if you can't?
    589332|00000000||I'll guide you out of here.
    589418|00000000||Think Philippa's still here?
    589419|00000000||Can't rightly know. Sure, we searched a few caverns, but hidden nooks abound. If someone wanted to hide in here, they could, easily. Even if they weren't an owl.
    589334|00000000||Philippa still here?
    589333|00000000||Whaddaya think's set to happen here?
    589397|00000000||What's the big event that's supposed to happen?
    589416|00000000||Uhhh… Don't know the details, but I came across Philippa Eilhart's notes.
    589440|00000000||Mentioned Ida Emean, Margarita Laux-Antille, Francesca Findabair and Fringilla Vigo. As I see it, they aim to meet… here!
    589319|00000000||Stay back! Not one step closer!
    589321|00000000||Sheathe that before you hurt yourself.
    589323|00000000||Wait… You… You that witcher the king was supposed to send?
    589325|00000000||Guessed it. Think you know by now how dangerous this place is. Oughta wait up above with the others.
    589326|00000000||Not a chance! Those cowards ran at the first whiff of monsters. I'm made of stiffer stuff.
    589329|00000000||Besides, something big's set to happen here, I just know it… I learn what it is, Radovid'll appreciate it… King'll promote me, maybe even give me a medal.
    569604|00000000||That all you got?
    569603|00000000||Poxy mutant!
    472915|00000000||Run to the woods. Wait there till I come get you. Understood?!
    472917|00000000||Yes, da.
    473902|00000000||What ye be doin' here, traveler? Get out while ye can!
    475324|00000000||Go! Quick, now!
    569155|00000000||Yes, good fellow? If it's work you seek--
    572771|00000000||Don't know that I'm all that good. Name's Geralt. Looking for Patricia Vegelbud. Her life's in danger.
   1005128|00000000||A murderer has marked Patricia as his next victim.
   1005132|00000000||I'm hunting a serial killer. And I've got reason to believe your mother'll be his next victim.
   1005134|00000000||Why, even if it's true, our guards--
   1005136|00000000||He's exceptionally cruel when he kills. Tortures his victims. Cuts out their hearts.
   1069067|00000000||So let's see how she is. Just in case?
   1005138|00000000||I find this all very hard to believe… But you appear to be quite serious.
   1005140|00000000||Please, follow me.
   1005130|00000000||No time to explain. Trust me. Please.
   1005127|00000000||No time to explain.
   1005126|00000000||In danger? Come now. I saw mother this morning. She seemed sad, true, but in perfect health.
   1005122|00000000||Oh, Geralt! What a pleasant surprise!
   1005124|00000000||Not pleasant at all. I gotta see your mother. Her life's in danger.
    448381|00000000||A fire fit for Belleteyn. Except it's the wrong time of year.
    448425|00000000||I mentioned mother seemed sad, do you remember? In fact… She's in the midst of a crisis of faith. A rather serious one.
    448429|00000000||We'd been to Novigrad. Mother had seen the pyres in Hierarch Square… Uttered not a word on our way home.
   1005118|00000000||She had all the holy books, insignias, reliquaries gathered, taken outside and burnt. Then she locked herself in her room.
   1005120|00000000||We need to hurry.
   1083137|370dcba4||Gargoyle
    525143|00000000||Here to fight? Come on, have a chat with me.
    569616|00000000||I think… think it worked.
    569625|00000000||Right! Enough!
    589483|00000000||I'll give you the damned crystal.
    569626|00000000||Outta my way.
    569628|00000000||I'll just wait here. They'll come for me.
    569629|00000000||I'm not goin' nowhere.
    589488|00000000||Your choice.
   1051475|00000000||I wanna race.
    399281|00000000||Grand. Your name and the name of your steed?
   1051499|00000000||Geralt of Rivia on Roach.
   1051501|00000000||Excellent. Your opponent, let me see… Seamus Holt astride Athos.
   1051477|00000000||Like to race again.
    399285|00000000||Excellent, don't go anywhere, we'll start soon. Your opponent this time - Viscount Rommer astride Caniculus.
   1051479|00000000||The viscount races incognito, so I must ask for your discretion.
   1051481|00000000||Wanna try again.
    399289|00000000||Gained an appetite, have we? Your opponent this time - Luc Vegelbud, young Lord Albert's cousin, atop Succubus.
   1051483|00000000||He's the black sheep of the family, but he's not lost a race yet, so he's seen as something of a local champion.
    399263|00000000||Here's my entrance fee. I wanna race.
    399267|00000000||Maybe later.
    399265|00000000||Tell me about the races.
   1051465|00000000||These races - tell me about them.
    399277|00000000||They're run as per Erasmus Vegelbud's dying wish. He came into his fortune by gambling and remained proud of the fact to the end.
   1051467|00000000||Family doesn't mind having a race track right by their house?
   1051469|00000000||But the house, his fortune, would not even be theirs had they not fulfilled Lord Erasmus' wish - he made it a condition.
   1051471|00000000||Any special rules for the races?
   1051473|00000000||They're as simple as Lord Erasmus was. Two competitors, simultaneous start, first to complete a lap around the track wins.
    399259|00000000||Wondering if I could take part in the races.
    399261|00000000||If you've coin for the rider's fee and a steed of your own - why not?
   1051463|00000000||Decide quickly, please. There's a race about to begin.
    403283|00000000||Not bad. Yet we shouldn't kid ourselves, the competition was hardly stiff.
    403285|00000000||Bravo. Congratulations, you won in style.
    403277|00000000||You lost by a nose.
    403389|00000000||Fantastic race! Congratulations, a grand victory!
    403387|00000000||Luc Vegelbud is good, but he's not unbeatable.
    472508|00000000||What terrible luck for you. Well, there's always the next time.
    403273|00000000||It's no shame to lose to the best. Which doesn't mean you shouldn't keep trying.
    403275|00000000||Shall I sign you up for another?
    399279|00000000||Another race? Will you ride?
    403281|00000000||Kudos! After all these years, we've a new champion!
   1051485|00000000||That's no small feat, you ought to be proud of yourself!
   1051489|00000000||Glory to the victor!
    472722|00000000||Hear ye! Hear ye! The final of the Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby is over! The winner is Geralt of Rivia, riding Roach!
   1053303|00000000||More Velen rabble, they let 'em in yesterday. How do those buggers scrounge up passes?
   1053305|00000000||How? They nick 'em. Not a bloke there who's not a thief.
   1053307|00000000||They'll steal the bread from our mouths, now. And what they don't take, they'll ruin. Wild folk.
   1053309|00000000||They'll take our jobs, too. Ready to trudge about a lord's fields all day for a bloody bowl o' grub.
    570084|00000000||Here to talk about the contract.
    570085|00000000||Contract? Ah yes, put my mark to something of the sort. Seems a creature's attacking lonely passers-by, abandoning their corpses in gutters around Oxenfurt.
   1039944|00000000||Isn't that something you should look into?
   1016169|00000000||Perhaps, but we've a ploughin' war to win. Haven't got the time to clean gutters.
    570953|00000000||Any witnesses to these attacks? Anyone see the beast?
    570954|00000000||Some woman survived an attack. They say she's not been sober since. I'd try the tavern in Oxenfurt if you're willing to try talking to her.
    570936|00000000||Any witnesses?
    570935|00000000||Victims - tell me about them.
    570949|00000000||Like to examine the victims' bodies.
    570950|00000000||A corpse is a corpse.
    570951|00000000||I see the wounds, might be able to tell what kind of monster killed them.
    570952|00000000||Ask our sawbones - he'll know if the corpses have been burned or not. You'll most likely find him in the hut on the riverbank, our impromptu morgue.
    570958|00000000||Won't give me any trouble with the reward, will you?
    570959|00000000||Nah. I want this out of my hair.
   1042809|00000000||I'll take the job. Need to hear some details.
   1042811|00000000||You'll learn everything I know.
   1042801|00000000||Fine. I'll do it.
    570937|00000000||So long.
    570078|00000000||Killed the monster.
    570974|00000000||Killed the monster that was murdering folk. Turns out a katakan was prowling the city.
    570975|00000000||You speak true? But… what on earth's a katakan?
    570976|00000000||A higher vampire. Particularly interesting case, this one.
   1016177|00000000||How the hell could a foul beast be interesting?
   1016179|00000000||This one liked alcohol, had a hugely inflated ego, too.
    570977|00000000||What matters is you snuffed it out. Due some praise for that, witcher.
    570079|00000000||Farewell.
   1042805|00000000||Sorry, can't take the job right now.
   1042803|00000000||Don't have time.
   1042802|00000000||Reward's too small.
   1042807|00000000||Let's talk about the reward.
   1047740|00000000||Acquit yourself well and you'll not be disappointed. Redanian army's no band of scruffs - we can afford to hire a witcher.
   1067904|00000000||I know guildsmen ought to be decently rewarded, but there you've gone too far. I don't have that coin.
   1067906|00000000||I see you've taken a more reasonable tack. We're finally getting somewhere. But it's still too much.
   1067910|00000000||I've heard enough. You'll take the offered rate, and if it's not to your liking, well, away with you.
   1067908|00000000||Very well. That I can pay with a clear conscience.
   1042813|00000000||Wanna talk about the witchers' contract.
   1042815|00000000||Am I to assume you've changed your mind? You'll tend to the matter?
    570077|00000000||Here about the witchers' contract.
    570076|00000000||Hm?
    466774|00000000||This is the place.
    488341|00000000||Been here before?
    488343|00000000||No. I was hoping the elf would return as he'd promised, or else his waif would appear. At any rate, I've no idea what to expect from this place.
    488345|00000000||Well, let's find out.
    466772|00000000||Can we go? I'd like to finally meet this mysterious elf.
    474793|00000000||I do wonder if the two of you will hit it off.
    475783|00000000||Not like I wanna bed him. Just want to ask him about Ciri.
   1051423|00000000||There you are… at last.
   1046857|00000000||Wide, deep print. A dwarf?
    511311|00000000||Piss off. Can't you see I'm fuckin' busy?
    595472|00000000||Elephant in a china shop, I swear. Set off almost all my traps.
    595471|00000000||Your reflexes have slowed. Hope you're not hurt. Those were my traps.
    593662|00000000||Why're you here?
    593668|00000000||"Them"? You know I work alone. Question is, what're you doing here?
    593678|00000000||Waiting for them. The ones trying to kill me.
    593680|00000000||Came here by accident, actually.
    593682|00000000||Accidents sure send you to strange places. Till recently this place was full of ghouls.
    593693|00000000||Who's after you?
    593731|00000000||Who'd you piss off this time?
    593720|00000000||Emperor just decided to get rid of me - I'm an inconvenient witness, after all. I've run into loads of men out to kill me ever since I left Loc Muinne.
    593736|00000000||Now I understand all the traps.
    593738|00000000||Gotten real careful.
    563970|00000000||For good reason.
    593725|00000000||Hiding in a place overrun by monsters - good idea.
    593727|00000000||Means people don't wander in by accident. And the ones who come on purpose, well, I'm prepared for them.
    593729|00000000||Assassins?
    593692|00000000||Great place to hide.
    563973|00000000||Took a job from an old woman. Supposed to get rid of the monsters here.
    593691|00000000||Did that already. Count on you remembering that when you collect your pay.
    593684|00000000||Well, got nothing to fear from me.
    593665|00000000||Who's "them"?
    593676|00000000||To the emperor - mercenaries. To themselves - bounty hunters. To me - ordinary sons of bitches.
    593661|00000000||What're you talking about?
    593658|00000000||Letho?!
    593660|00000000||Yeah, didn't expect to see you, either. You one of them?
    595458|00000000||Bravo, Geralt. Avoided all my traps.
   1056219|00000000||He who has lived in virtue shall find warmth at the Fire! He who has lived in sin shall perish within it!
   1056093|00000000||Eternal Fire, light my way, Eternal Fire, deliver us from evil…
   1056091|00000000||The pyre for all witches! The pyre for all freaks! The pyre for nonhumans, one and all!
   1056085|00000000||The time of the cleansing has come! The Fire shall sear the boils, consume all sinners!
    572370|00018392||Earth Elemental
    581248|00000000||So, how did you fare in the first round?
    581257|00000000||Not bad. Guessing you won, too.
    581258|00000000||I've the distinct impression my opponent was drunk. Had an altogether decent hand, but…
   1014422|00000000||Mighta had a hard time concentrating.
   1014446|00000000||Hmmm… Care to finish this conversation in private? I've a proposition for you. Meet on the terrace upstairs.
    581259|00000000||Tournament's over for me, I'm afraid.
    581260|00000000||Hmm… Not necessarily. I've a proposition for you. Shall we discuss it upstairs? Lovely view from the terrace.
   1014500|00000000||All right.
   1014452|00000000||Fine.
   1014459|00000000||Not interested.
   1014502|00000000||Honestly? I'm just here to play cards.
   1014514|00000000||Ah well. Too bad.
   1014518|00000000||Honestly? I just came to play cards. Since I lost in the first round…
   1014520|00000000||I'd not expected you to give in so easily. Ah well - too bad.
    472385|00000000||We'll get the old bugger, you'll see.
    472387|00000000||Bastard deserves to 'ang.
    472656|00000000||Nah. Hanging's over before there's any pain. This cocksucker's got to suffer.
    475672|00000000||We'll stuff him full of that shite he told Edric to eat. Let him blow his guts out of his arse, too.
    555212|00000000||Grave's been dug up… recently. Smell of cadaverine's old, though. Overripe. Wonder where the stench'll lead me…
   1022224|00000000||Ghouls could've dug up the corpse… definitely couldn't 'uve snatched the kid from the village, though.
   1025923|00000000||Still might be worth looking at those graves…
   1022232|00000000||Hm, whatever filth lives here sure chose a unusual place for its lair.
   1022237|00000000||Creature can use tools… means it's sapient. Or just plain clever.
   1022239|00000000||Somebody's doing some cooking. This… it's a human femur… a child's.
   1022247|00000000||Gotta be a grave hag.
   1044416|00000000||Collected the skulls to draw the Power through them. Confidence grew enough it started prowling the village.
   1041576|00000000||Human skulls in a magic circle. Monster's clearly using them, drawing strength from the Place of Power.
   1041582|00000000||Need to take the skulls, force it to go back to the cemetery. I'll get it there.
   1041715|00000000||That oughta really piss it off. Now to lay low in the cemetery. It's likely to crawl out there after dark.
   1048647|00000000||Dug up with a hoe? Nope - claw marks right there.
   1048646|00000000||Dug up - no tools used, though.
   1048649|00000000||Ghouls dug up the graves, then the stench of decay attracted wild dogs.
   1049744|00000000||But neither ghouls nor dogs steal kids.
   1071544|00000000||Can't get away, Duke! Might as well stop!
   1071546|00000000||Never!
   1071598|00000000||Stop! Area's dangerous!
   1071600|00000000||Piss off!
   1071602|00000000||Stop, dammit!
    590861|00000000||Careful, men! They're witchers!
    590862|00000000||Witchers don't attack humans!
    590863|00000000||Make an exception for you.
    421117|00000000||Got coin to spend?
    497851|00000000||I might.
   1086479|00000000||Let's play gwent.
   1059828|00000000||A woman came through here. Barefoot.
   1004322|00000000||These pelts reek somethin' merciless…
   1004323|00000000||You get them off necrophages?
   1004325|00000000||*Spits* Of a sort. Beasts were eatin' corpses in a field…
   1004326|00000000||‘Cept they barked and yelped when I killed 'em. Heheheh.
   1084497|ddbc0aa8||Prostitute
    571652|00000000||Someone's journal…
   1011609|00000000||Help!
   1011605|00000000||Greetings, handsome.
   1011599|00000000||Boring.
   1011597|00000000||Make love, not war!
    506279|00000000||Poor troll. Wonder if he can afford a witcher…
   1003874|00000000||Ice encased his armor… Like winter on a glass pane…
   1003876|00000000||His eyes red, like embers in a fire.
   1003878|00000000||He leaned o'er me and whispered…
   1003880|00000000||Boo!!
   1003882|00000000||Aaaaaah!
   1003884|00000000||Heheheh!
   1013748|00000000||Gimme your purse.
   1013752|00000000||Not your lucky day, miss. Hand me your purse, now.
   1013762|00000000||More like the Crimson Asshole.
   1013766|00000000||More like the Crimson Asshole.
   1013768|00000000||Silence, vermin! You shall regret the day you were born!
   1013764|00000000||No! Not the… Crimson Avenger!
   1013760|00000000||[Read from card.]
   1025876|00000000||Not so fast!
   1013754|00000000||Drop your sword, scoundrel! This is your first and last warning.
   1013756|00000000||Dandelion?!
   1013758|00000000||Tis I. Though the scum of this city call me the Crimson Avenger!
   1013750|00000000||Tremble… Flaxen-haired wench?! Umm… Bow before the prince of thieves!
   1013746|00000000||[Read from card.]
    577436|00000000||Stop right there!
   1013744|00000000||Wha… What is this? Help! Save me!
   1044806|00000000||Fine, let's get this over with.
    358700|00000000||Oh, Bart! Not again!
    358702|00000000||…Bart?
    446265|00000000||Give me a name. Then I'll release you.
    446267|00000000||Told you, don't know any mages!
    446269|00000000||But surely you know someone who does. You can either help willingly… or after torture.
    446271|00000000||Jouke… Willem Jouke. Someone makes brews for 'im.
    450190|00000000||He's got kids.
    450192|00000000||As do I.
    446238|00000000||We've no dealings with mages. I swear!
    446240|00000000||Kept my distance from wizardry me whole life.
    446242|00000000||You work for the King of Beggars. As does Merigold. Where is she?
    450186|00000000||Don't know. I swear on me mum!
    450188|00000000||On your mum? Well, then we'll take her in for torture. Perhaps that'll refresh your memory.
   1061509|00000000||An old elven… port?
   1062122|00000000||Must've been how they got here by sea.
   1062124|00000000||I wonder how long ago that was…
   1061511|00000000||Careful! That oily, yellow vapor - it's toxic.
   1061513|00000000||I hardly need instruction from you. I recognized the vulpine morel immediately.
   1061515|00000000||Vesemir told me that soon after he'd learned to cast Igni, he tried it out on a patch of these mushrooms.
   1062126|00000000||Terrible idea. What happened?
   1061517|00000000||Well, he survived. And wounds heal awfully quick on young witchers. Come on.
   1061519|00000000||Expect me to splash about in that sewage? Unlikely. I'll wait here.
   1061521|00000000||How was the water?
   1061524|00000000||Refreshing. Don't know what you're missing.
   1061529|00000000||A swallow. Seems we're headed the right way.
   1044850|00000000||Oh, my… *Sob sob*
   1044852|00000000||I'm feelin' better. I look better, don't I? Better? *Cough cough cough*
   1044854|00000000||Help me!
   1044858|00000000||No! Noooo!
   1044856|00000000||Let me in! I don't wanna die!
    381740|00000000||Come back… come back… come back…
   1059016|00000000||He has come… for you…
   1009792|00000000||Hmm… Think I can move this…
   1009793|00000000||Seems the exchange is gonna be unsuccessful…
    505128|00000000||Looks like a drop of some sort…
    463209|00000000||Wolves'll tear it to pieces. Gotta help.
    484933|00000000||Akh akh akh… You pig! Tryin' to suffocate me, you oaf, you dolt! Someone'll do the same to you one day!
    500451|00000000||Bleugh akh… Take this stupid 'ouse, you burdockin' bully!
    501599|00000000||Keep your distance.
   1052205|00000000||See the empty ship in port?
   1052207|00000000||Mmhhhmmm…
   1052209|00000000||No one knows how it got there, who it belongs to…
   1052211|00000000||Huh…
   1052213|00000000||That all you got to say? Huh?
   1052215|00000000||When I don't understand somethin', I think it best to keep me mouth shut.
   1045545|00000000||Lucas and Kobe… I shall remember those names. And when the emperor takes Novigrad, I will find them and have them pay.
   1045547|00000000||Easy. Didn't hurt you in the end.
   1045549|00000000||They raised their hand against me. That's enough to have that hand lopped off.
   1044695|00000000||And you wonder why the North hates Nilfgaard.
   1044711|00000000||And you wonder why the locals hate Nilfgaard.
   1044713|00000000||I thought you were different from other Nordlings. That you understand us, our sense of justice. I see I was wrong.
   1045718|00000000||You should go home now. And take the shortest, not the scenic route.
   1045720|00000000||I understand. Farewell, Geralt. And good luck on the Path.
   1044697|00000000||Lesson's over. Remember what you've learned today. Looks like you'll be using that sword often.
   1045714|00000000||It's beyond me, Geralt, I don't understand you. Why concern yourself with the fate of two drunkards? The world would be a better place without--
   1044694|00000000||Lesson's over.
   1044691|00000000||Understand now why your father insists soldiers follow you around?
   1044693|00000000||So they can save me. As you did.
   1045706|00000000||No. So you won't need saving to begin with. Rosa… those humans died because of you.
   1045708|00000000||What of it? Do you expect me to shed a tear? Observe a minute of silence? They were dregs, they got they deserved!
   1013654|00000000||Farewell.
   1013695|00000000||See ya.
   1013707|00000000||Play in tournaments often?
   1013705|00000000||What's it to you? Perhaps you'd wish to see my cards, as well? Am I a he-whore for you to fondle before you choose? Shall I wag my prick for you?
   1013731|00000000||See your cards when we play.
   1013729|00000000||You're unlikely to advance that far, mutant.
   1013653|00000000||Play in tournaments often?
    579869|00000000||What?
   1029121|00000000||{Moedron… Tuvean ess'cáemm aep me…} [Mother… death comes for me…]
   1029123|00000000||{Iss'kund… aegeef a me es bloeede iss'kund } [Medicine… Give me the damn medicine…]
   1029124|00000000||{Vùtter… } [Water…]
    426756|00000000||Bah, gray and grizzled yet gullible as a calf. Get 'im!
    490043|00000000||Get the whore! Ploughing put her down!
    490044|00000000||On with it - grab the cunt.
    511253|00000000||Wee bit busy, mate.
    491201|00000000||Die! Arggh…. Die, dammit!
    503634|00000000||Burghers and burgesses of the Free City of Novigrad! Master Claytop - that would be me - has the honor to announce that betting is now open!
    516203|00000000||Georgius Georg, known also as Piledriver, is the name of our tavern's champion!
    516205|00000000||Will anyone dare try to dethrone our reigning king?!
    503646|00000000||I believe I see a challenger who seeks to subdue Piledriver!
    389175|00000000||Help an old, feeble woman?
    389177|00000000||What's wrong?
    389179|00000000||T'other night blasphemers - pox take them! - profaned the shrine to Verna the Merciful.
    420196|00000000||Shrine's gotta be repaired, else Verna'll take umbrage! Our cows'll croak, kiddies'll be covered in warts and our dogs'll get the mange!
    389227|00000000||Boils sprout on your foreskin!
    420218|00000000||Sorry. Don't have time for this.
    420214|00000000||Sorry. Short on time.
    420212|00000000||Lemme help you.
    420216|00000000||Warts and mange? Sounds dangerous. Fine, I'll help you.
   1054313|00000000||The Eternal Fire protects us, but a witcher sure comes in handy at times.
    470239|00000000||Ah, another challenger! Please, join us! Sir Devanon just vacated his place at the table. It's rather unlikely he'll be back!
    509988|00000000||What happened to him?
    509990|00000000||Some good men took him aside to prevent him from hurting himself.
    470241|00000000||So? Shall we play?
    470299|00000000||Well, now you must win it back!
    510015|00000000||So - one more round? When the cards come your way, you must spring on the opportunity!
    470293|00000000||Sir Marius Florin.
    510212|00000000||They say he never loses thanks to his zeugl-bone amulet. Naturally, I could tell you more on the subject, but…
    470291|00000000||Your next opponent - Count Gomo Seeling.
    510174|00000000||In his day, his father lost the family estate in the Nimnar Valley. Seems Gomo has followed in his footsteps.
    510178|00000000||Yet do not underestimate him. Desperate men can be dangerous.
    470289|00000000||First you shall face Margrave Vladimir de Cret.
    510173|00000000||The man can afford to lose, so he's likely to be reckless.
    470287|00000000||Bravo! The lovely lady clearly brings you luck, sir - hold her, keep her, never let her go!
    470254|00000000||Not in the mood.
    470256|00000000||Hahahah. Not in the mood to win?
    470245|00000000||No thanks.
    470243|00000000||I'd like to play.
    470252|00000000||Let's do it.
   1030669|00000000||Temple guard on the street… Pass a mage, start to beat…
   1030671|00000000||Now he's bleeding, now he fell… Dead or sleeping, who can tell…
   1030673|00000000||There's a snort, there's a breath… guardsman's kickin' him to death…
   1030675|00000000||Lights out, curfew, mage is done… His eyes need closin', you're the one!
   1075705|00000000||Somebody was bound. Rope was cut quickly, with a dull blade.
    497164|00000000||Let's go. But get ready for them to creak some more… Not likely to find pearls where it's dry.
    497165|00000000||True… But I survived worse during the war. At Rosrok we fought waist-deep in the swamp and… Argh, wastin' my breath… History don't mean a whit to youngsters. Come on, pearl grounds aren't far now.
    497159|00000000||Let's go.
    497168|00000000||Yeah… You'll need to hang on a bit longer. Got something to take care of.
    497160|00000000||I'll be back.
    497158|00000000||Phew… Good you're here… So, what'll it be? Will you help old Nidas find a black pearl for his wife? I'd like it done already. Humidity's unkind to my bones - they've started creaking.
   1006713|00000000||The rose of remembrance… All dried up.
   1040856|92c87bd7||Harmon aep Groenekan
   1038529|00000000||Stopped feeding here… Moved towards open ground to fly away.
    379776|00000000||Good. It's clear. Not a Crone in sight. I need to sing to Gran, that oughta calm her.
    379779|00000000||Little Johnny softly gazing, fire waning, pale
    379781|00000000||Pop! A spark jumped out and whispered…
    379783|00000000||Listen, I've a tale…
    420710|00000000||Lead me to the Crones?
    420714|00000000||Can you take me to the Crones?
    420716|00000000||Forgive me, Gran, but this fellow absolutely must talk to the Ladies.
    420718|00000000||No, 'tis not allowed.
    420720|00000000||Please. It's important.
    420722|00000000||The fellow will be quiet. Gran, please hear me out.
    420724|00000000||I found little Yagna when she got lost, did I not? Did I break Genny's fever too? I did. I ask anything in return? No. Didn't even fuss about my stolen voice.
    420726|00000000||Well, now I want something. Gran, help this fellow. Because otherwise he'll pester me day and night, even durin' potty time. His lass is missing, mayhaps the Ladies can help find her, eh?
    420728|00000000||Well, since you put it that way, Johnny... I'll help him.
    420730|00000000||Come with me.
    420712|00000000||The woman I asked about earlier...
    420708|00000000||The ashen-haired woman...
    420704|00000000||You... got your voice back?
    420706|00000000||I did! Though I seem to have lost an octave somewhere in the process. I shall look for it when I get home.
    382015|00000000||You're not allowed here, Johnny. You shouldn't 'ave come.
    382017|00000000||Calm down, Gran. Don't get angry - it's not good for you.
   1058295|00000000||Triss! Found an exit.
   1058297|00000000||Ooof… For a minute, I actually thought we were doomed.
    447613|00000000||A library…?
   1039769|00000000||Assire var Anahid's necklace?
   1039773|00000000||Assire var Anahid's necklace?
   1039781|00000000||So, got the full set of cards. What now?
   1038341|00000000||Now we collect a shiteload o' coin for them. Let's go.
   1039777|00000000||Natalis card - only one missing now. High time we saw Ravvy.
   1038338|00000000||Go. I should contact the buyer, agree on a place to make the transaction. See you, Geralt.
   1039775|00000000||Agh, never mind, then.
   1039771|00000000||A portrait of Emhyr?
   1039768|00000000||A portrait of Emhyr?
   1038337|00000000||What can you do? We meant well.
   1039738|00000000||Oh, by the way, see anythin' interestin' upstairs? Anythin' worth goin' back for?
    182986|00000000||Is there not one competent instructor in this entire city?
    183173|00000000||Guards let me in.
    183175|00000000||Guards aren't up to muster. Let me right in - just had to tell them I was here to teach you swordplay.
    183230|00000000||I told father they're a band of imbeciles! But if you're not the instructor, then who exactly are you? Have you come to rob? Kill? Speak!
    183232|00000000||Neither, so whaddaya say we stay calm.
    502054|00000000||Uh, what's so exciting about it?
    502057|00000000||Living on the edge, tracking, then facing down beasts, sleeping under the stars! Oh, it must be wonderful!
    502059|00000000||Mm, try fighting a zeugl while up to your neck in sewage… Nothing quite like it.
    502061|00000000||Not one of the high points, I suppose… Wait, weren't you about to ask me something?
    502051|00000000||What's exciting about it?
    502052|00000000||Very. I'm looking for Dandelion.
    502066|00000000||Incredibly. But we oughta discuss that another time.
    183236|00000000||Came to ask about your rhetoric tutor, Dandelion.
    183254|00000000||Rhetoric tutor? Good one. That is why papa hired him, but not at all what the bard had in mind. He mostly played his lute and sang for us. I believe he thought he was wooing…
    183268|00000000||Mean he wasn't? But you had some sort of... relationship?
    183318|00000000||If you call him chasing after me a relationship… Even so, there was nothing between us.
    502067|00000000||Seems my sister's had a bit of fun at our expense. But enough chatter! Stand and fight! I demand a rematch!
    381174|00000000||Need to ask you about Dandelion.
    381242|00000000||You're not bad with a sword.
    381244|00000000||Before I ask… Gotta admit - you do pretty well with a sword. One pointer - don't expose your left flank when you dodge.
    381246|00000000||Oh, I know, terrible habit. Can't seem to get rid of it. I'd hoped to find someone in Novigrad who could help me to do so.
    381248|00000000||Buuuut - don't you dare try to dazzle me with advice. Already admitted you're not here to give me lessons.
    183208|00000000||Am I imagining things? Didn't we just have this conversation? In the garden?
    513910|00000000||The garden…? Yes, yes! In the garden.
    183210|00000000||So, what was it you said? Why are you here?
    183137|00000000||Didn't we just talk?
    183139|00000000||I'm a witcher, here on business.
    183141|00000000||I'm a witcher. I'm looking f--
    183143|00000000||A witcher! That's splendid! I always wanted to meet a witcher! This is so exciting!
    183171|00000000||I'm a witcher, here on business.
    182981|00000000||I'm not actually your swordplay instructor.
    183114|00000000||Really. Then who are you? And how on earth did you get in?!
    182984|00000000||Well fought. You're much better than the last one.
   1004231|00000000||You filthy ditch digger! You robbed me gran!
   1004232|00000000||But she been on the yard more'n a week now! Buried her meself.
   1004233|00000000||Took the gold crowns from her casket, too!
   1004234|00000000||Ferryman'll not give her passage! Her spirit's lost, haunts me in me sleep.
   1004235|00000000||She'll talk 'im into takin' her. It's how she managed in life, it's how she'll manage in death.
    380300|00000000||Geralt, remember, I can take care of myself.
    380302|00000000||What're you talking about?
    380304|00000000||The hunters… They won't treat me like a lady. But I'll survive. Might hurt a bit, but…
    391726|00000000||Ciri - she's what matters… Do what you need to do, no matter what happens.
    433341|00000000||Can't promise that.
    433343|00000000||I'm still asking you to. All right?
    433345|00000000||All right.
    364916|00000000||I think we're going the wrong way…
    364925|00000000||I really shouldn't saunter around town long… Someone might recognize me.
    487101|00000000||It's why I must go.
    487103|00000000||I certainly hope not. It's brought me no small trouble.
    487105|00000000||Meanin'?
    487108|00000000||I must flee.
    487106|00000000||Wraiths pursue me. The Wild Hunt. I was foolish to use the Power. They're sure to have caught my scent.
    487111|00000000||The Wild Hunt? Pursuing you?
    487120|00000000||I'll endanger all of you by remaining here. You must tell the people to bar their doors and windows. And no one is to wander the night.
    487123|00000000||And you… where do you think you're going?
    487125|00000000||Now, I ride for Novigrad. And then who knows where.
    487075|00000000||You helped me as well - when your man brought me here. You fed me, cared for me, had my wounds looked after.
    487077|00000000||We're even now.
    487080|00000000||You needn't leave. You're in good company here. We'll always have a warm corner for you.
    487083|00000000||I must leave.
    487100|00000000||We're even.
    487095|00000000||You have everythin'?
    487097|00000000||Yes, thank you.
    487099|00000000||What you did for me… I-- I shall never forget it.
    473047|00000000||It's getting worse and worse. Time to leave's approaching.
    474209|00000000||Shame Miss Tammy's not here. She'd manage somethin'.
    473045|00000000||Well, this is a fucking first.
   1048295|00000000||Heheh! A bloke with bollocks to stand up to the baron!
    373824|00000000||She ran off toward the orphanage. Kids could know something, or the old woman who takes care of them…
    477551|00000000||That old hag don't speak to strangers. And you're a stranger.
    479691|00000000||Will she talk to you?
    477546|00000000||I have spoken to her, got my ways… So be it. You helped me, and I'm no boor. Come with me.
    373399|00000000||So she went off towards the village…
    373407|00000000||What do you know about the Crones?
    415707|00000000||They're as old as this forest. Cruel, vindictive… Not to be crossed.
    417943|00000000||What if someone does cross them?
    373409|00000000||Might take his voice, might take his life - depends on their whim. They're nasty, although… they care for this land and its folk in their own way. Supposedly they always keep their word, but you must be careful what you ask for.
    415783|00000000||Won't find them until they want to be found, see them until they want to be seen. But remember, they see and hear all that happens in the mire.
    373401|00000000||Know anything about the Crones?
    373832|00000000||The woman from the village in the swamp… Who is she?
    373411|00000000||I've been to the village in the swamp, met a woman who might've been a Crone.
    373415|00000000||Did she seem… confused to you?
    415709|00000000||Nuts, completely.
    373417|00000000||Oof, so I'm not crazy. That's no Crone, that's the granny who takes care of the orphans. Claims the kids made me up. Me.
    417945|00000000||An orphanage in a swamp?
    417947|00000000||What d'you have against swamps? Lived here my whole life and I heartily recommend it.
    479693|00000000||I'm looking for a young, ashen-haired woman. See anyone like that?
    479695|00000000||Did I ever. Remember it as if it were yesterday. Soon as I woke, I went to empty my bowels - my favorite part of the day. Defecatin' to the sunrise - downright glorious…
    479697|00000000||Suddenly, heard a bang - so loud it couldn't 'ave been me. And that lass appeared! Out of nowhere. Young, ashen-haired - just like you said. Wounded, and panting to boot!
    479699|00000000||She raced off towards the children's huts. Quick - as if the Crones were after her. I yelled some unpleasantries - she'd disturbed my morn. Sadly, I'd lost my voice, so I don't think she heard me.
    367345|00000000||Looking for a young, ashen-haired woman.
    482411|00000000||How do you lock someone's voice in a bottle? Just wondering…
    482412|00000000||As am I - especially as mine's a voice to crown all voices. Sometimes it's like a forest brook, at others like a roll of thunder. And let's be honest - I talk enough to fill three barrels and more.
    482413|00000000||Somebody used some powerful magic on you - as a prank or just to be mean.
    482410|00000000||How do you bottle someone's voice?
    367347|00000000||Why did you lose your voice?
    373383|00000000||How'd you lose your voice?
    367364|00000000||One morning I awoke and opened my mouth for my usual bout of singing with the thrushes. Lo and behold, no sound escaped. I tried and tried, almost burst a blood vessel.
    415717|00000000||Then I went to the village, 'cause word has it the new cunning woman works miracles. But people began crying out "A smudger! A smudger!" and sicced their dogs on me.
    420525|00000000||Do I look like a smudger to you?
    417782|00000000||Not a bit.
    415719|00000000||I thought not. So it must be the Crones' doing. Who else would curse me? Blackbird friend of mine located my voice, but I was helpless to retrieve it.
    392627|00000000||Couldn't ask a raven friend to just give you the bottle?
    367366|00000000||Ravens serve the Crones. They don't help no one.
    373361|00000000||Whiskey! Slither! Ringworm! Rubbish! Bumblebee! Flabbergasted! Ha! The sound of it!
    417768|00000000||Peter Piper picked Prince Proximo a peck of pickled peppers by the Pontar. Hahaha.
    373363|00000000||Done celebrating?
    373365|00000000||My favorite words... Life without savoring the sound of "surreptitious shananacking" is like licking snails through a cloth.
    373369|00000000||Thank you for this, noble whoever-you-are. Long be your life.
    415703|00000000||Hang on a minute... I helped you - now you help me.
    415705|00000000||Would you turn this beautiful act of altruism into a banal bartering of favors?
    382005|00000000||Here.
    420527|00000000||{Struggles to remove cork}
    419987|00000000||Ah, the bottle from the nest. Already got it.
    419989|00000000||{Reaches out for the bottle and waits impatiently}
    379745|00000000||Guess I gotta make this climb.
    379747|00000000||{nods, pleased}
    415177|00000000||This the place? Let me look around.
    379739|00000000||{points up to a cliff edge with ravens circling above it}
    379741|00000000||Something's on the ledge? Something that'll get you your voice back?
    379743|00000000||{energetically nods}
    385092|00000000||Looks tasty... But just an illusion.
    385094|00000000||Someone's using fake treats as bait.
    385090|00000000||Tasty illusion. Might've fallen for it if not for Keira's little gift.
   1030052|00000000||I'm on the right path.
   1006020|00000000||First, I gotta know why.
   1006039|00000000||First, gotta tell me why you do it.
   1006041|00000000||For pleasure. Satisfaction.
   1006095|00000000||Mmmmmmmm!
   1006043|00000000||Achievable with whores in a lot of ways, many traditional. Doesn't take killing them. Trust me.
   1006045|00000000||Who said anything about killing? I could stop at a few burns… Third-degree, but still. Mm, this rosy skin will roast quite well.
   1006099|00000000||Just can't listen to anymore of this shit.
   1006101|00000000||No one's forcing you to, mutant.
   1006096|00000000||Can't listen to this shit.
   1006097|00000000||Seen your victims. You never stop at that.
   1006108|00000000||Spare me your lies. I've seen your victims, I know how they end. You don't stop… not unless someone gets in your way. Like I'm doing now.
   1006012|00000000||Just like that? No formaldehyde?
   1006016|00000000||What, no foreplay? No formaldehyde, coals in my eye sockets?
   1006127|00000000||What the fuck are you on about?
   1006129|00000000||Murder. You killed Fabian Meyer. Patricia Vegelbud. And many others.
   1006131|00000000||Mmmff! Mmmmmmff!
   1006133|00000000||Bollocks. You're mistaken, vagrant.
   1006140|00000000||No time for you.
   1006148|00000000||Don't have time for you now. But kill her… and I'll find you.
   1006150|00000000||Calm yourself. I shan't do her any… permanent harm.
   1006152|00000000||Mmff! Mmmmf! Mmff!
   1006142|00000000||You'll untie her, drop your coin pouch on the table, then leave here and never come back.
   1006144|00000000||Yes. I will.
   1006146|00000000||Good boy.
   1006138|00000000||Leave her alone. Now.
   1006154|00000000||Then you'll pay again. For her, for all the other women you've tortured.
   1006139|00000000||Can't allow it.
   1006110|00000000||Found a message on Patricia's body. Led me here, to Crippled Kate's, to "Sweet Nettie." If you didn't leave it, who did?
   1006113|00000000||I don't know… But I see we must talk. Calmly.
   1006115|00000000||Who knew you'd be here?
   1006117|00000000||Strangely enough, I don't announce these outings far and wide. There's but one man who… But that's impossible. He treats even corpses with kid gloves.
   1006119|00000000||The coroner… Said you were busy. That you wouldn't visit the morgue. Gotta go after him.
   1006121|00000000||Go - to warehouse twelve at the docks. He's there this time of day, procuring supplies. Formaldehyde.
   1006123|00000000||I shall stay here. I've unfinished business with Sweet Nettie… After all, I paid in advance.
   1006125|00000000||MMMmmmmmmm!
   1006103|00000000||So who left the letter on Patricia's body?
   1006135|00000000||Be nice, or I'll shove that poker up your ass.
   1006137|00000000||Go on. Take it from me… Freak. Mutant.
   1006104|00000000||Mind your manners. Or regret it.
   1006102|00000000||Almost convinced me.
   1006106|00000000||Almost had me convinced. Almost.
   1006014|00000000||Try it, you bastard.
   1006011|00000000||Try it, asshole.
   1006003|00000000||Mmmmmmmff! Mmmff!
    573834|00000000||No one will hear you, bitch. Not a soul.
   1006005|00000000||You, though - whole town'll hear you in a minute.
   1006007|00000000||Yet again you disturb me. And I so dislike being disturbed.
   1006010|00000000||I was to play with Sweet Nettie. Render her no so sweet. But I shall see to you first.
    386348|00000000||Sorry. Ain't no rats gonna eat your eyes.
    420461|00000000||And I know we're not allowed to say dirty words.
    386350|00000000||Good child. Apologies mean treats to please a belly needing to be put at ease.
   1047377|00000000||Could at least follow a goat path.
   1047338|00000000||Come on. Where're you going?
   1047334|00000000||Stupid fucking goat. Follow me. Need to stay closer to it.
   1047823|00000000||You're no Roach, but I bet we could be friends in time.
   1047825|00000000||You've got that all-important quality every Roach has to have - you don't talk much.
    474339|00000000||Come on. Let's go see the pellar.
    474107|00000000||There you are…
    475723|00000000||All right, time to try the bell.
    474123|00000000||Here, goat! Ahem… Here, Princess!
    475721|00000000||Hoofed and horned - shoulda known it would be stubborn.
   1047775|00000000||Bear! Bear! Run, you stupid piece of shit!
    474796|00000000||Where the hell'd you go?
    474759|00000000||Do I really have to keep ringing this bell for you to follow?
   1047385|00000000||Looks like I gotta go get Her Highness, 'cause Her Highness is not about to come to me.
   1047382|00000000||It's slow, can't keep up with me. Gotta go back.
   1047415|00000000||Come on, dammit!
   1047411|00000000||Come on, take you back to the pellar. Misses you something awful.
   1047413|00000000||This way, Your Grace.
   1073875|00000000||Bear prowled this area. Good thing I ran into him earlier.
    472583|00000000||Hm, gotta wonder about a man who could get Edric's friends all worked up.
    474732|00000000||Should've guessed as much. What's a witcher compared to a patch of wild strawberries?
   1065557|00000000||Boot prints - but also some bare feet. Strange.
   1068458|00000000||Need to follow these deeper into the woods.
   1075994|00000000||Abandoned Nilfgaardian camp? Interesting…
   1075996|00000000||Oughta look around.
   1071297|00000000||Men, we've had a hard day.
   1072435|00000000||The fight was tough, we are bruised, this I know. We shall rest here for a time.
   1071299|00000000||Yes, sir!
   1064166|00000000||Hm… Cart doesn’t look damaged. Strange.
   1066147|00000000||Need to look around. Might find something.
   1064168|00000000||Signs of a scuffle.
   1066176|00000000||Somebody got knocked out, dragged off.
   1064172|00000000||Wonder where its wearer is…
   1064170|00000000||A shoe. Something tells me I'm on the right trail.
   1068653|00000000||Getting close.
   1062443|00000000||Go away! Please, begone!
    517904|00000000||A'right, your turn. Unless you can stand up for us.
    517906|00000000||But I was crippled as a lad. Fell beneath a cart. Wheel snapped me spine…
    517907|00000000||Time to finish what that driver started.
    517919|00000000||Mercy… I…
    517920|00000000||Yeah, I know. You've five brats, need coin for bread, surgery and a ticket 'ome. Do 'im!
   1051018|00000000||A miraculous recovery, there.
   1051020|00000000||The Eternal Fire's grace knows no bounds, brother.
   1051029|00000000||Well, well. Feignin' cripples, but they cut a fine figure runnin' when they need to…
   1056236|00000000||They can run faster still. Loose one at 'em, you'll see.
   1051031|00000000||No! Mercy! Spare us!
   1051022|00000000||The two of yous! Sod off.
   1051024|00000000||But master hunter, sir… we're not in no one's way, not botherin' a soul…
   1051026|00000000||You're botherin' me. Git, or we'll put bolts through both your necks.
    517900|00000000||Fare thee well!
    481191|00000000||Come on, lass!
   1055239|fc16e4fd||Poor Townsman
   1004373|00000000||Baron's hound is huge… Seen him runnin' loose of late.
   1004374|00000000||Gotta watch the young'uns, make sure they don't get hurt.
   1004375|00000000||It's not that… If we could trap the mutt, butcher it…
   1004376|00000000||True, true… Haven't eaten meat in a while.
   1016151|00000000||I can't take this.
   1016155|00000000||Keep it. Need it more than I do.
   1016157|00000000||Thank you. It's folk like you restore my faith in humankind.
   1016153|00000000||It's plenty. Farewell.
   1016150|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
    595296|00000000||Thanks so much. We'd not 'ave managed on our own…
   1016149|00000000||We're not rich, but I hope this is enough.
   1049382|00000000||Believe we've not had the pleasure. They call me the sergeant. Leftover from my army days, you understand.
   1049384|00000000||When me and Phillip, meanin' the baron, served under a Temerian banner. Wanted to ask you about somethin'.
    479605|00000000||No time.
    479609|00000000||No time.
    479611|00000000||This'll only take a minute.
    475044|00000000||That night when the baron ordered everyone to lock their doors, stay inside - what did you and the baron do?
    475046|00000000||Gotta ask the baron about that. Speaking of which, know where he is?
    475048|00000000||Garden. Spends a lot of time sittin' there of late.
    475050|00000000||Drunk.
    475052|00000000||No. Don't drink, don't eat… just sits.
    479607|00000000||What is it?
    479604|00000000||What is it?
    479603|00000000||Witcher - a word, please.
   1037755|00000000||I've been hit… Oww…
   1037757|00000000||To the house, quickly! He shan't get us there!
    577127|00000000||Eternal Fire, what do you want from us?! Leave us be!
    577128|00000000||This rogue will soon run off, I'm sure of it. He wouldn't chance getting caught by the guards.
    579501|00000000||Would he?!
   1029067|00000000||{Vatt'ghern? } [A witcher?]
   1029068|00000000||Look what they have done… Kill them. They are monsters.
   1029069|00000000||{Go'deff me… Go'deff me sehr… } [It hurts… It hurts so bad…]
   1029070|00000000||{Neen… Aaa… Waen nee… } [No… Aaahh… I don't want to…]
   1051407|00000000||{Yn brath'va que ge'tan foilé Franz von Suppe? } [Do you know what that madman Franz von Suppe did?]
   1051409|00000000||{Aep ceathrad evallan va'a Pontar, deithe phea thorpan, toog prìsonan... } [He led forty riders across the Pontar, burned a few villages, took prisoners...]
   1051411|00000000||{Thaë luath d'lùth balla aep Oxenfurt... Yn neen'loos va'mi aep a'vean hàr } [Then they galloped right past the walls of Oxenfurt on the way back… and made it home without a single casualty!]
   1051413|00000000||{Ech… Ruit'reigmeidë misneach. N'ess saoil, ess'fuirick aep Ker'zaer... } [Ehh, the cavalry - reckless as ever. But who can blame them? How long can we sit here, await the emperor's decision…?]
   1051415|00000000||{Du, brath'va var'oom licht ruit'reigmeid verdenë ainm licht? } [Hey, do you know what makes the Verden light cavalry "light"?]
   1051417|00000000||{Eeee, var'oom? } [Uhhh… what?]
   1051419|00000000||{Ess'vluchten licht. } [They're light on courage.]
   1051421|00000000||Buahehehehe.
    405781|00000000||Did I have sex with Keira (in the Keira sidequest, sq101)?
    405785|00000000||No
    405783|00000000||Yes
   1086603|00000000||Do I expect the battle at Kaer Morhen? (q402 started)
   1086605|00000000||No
   1086604|00000000||Yes
    335825|00000000||Junior claims you agreed to pay him more.
    500970|00000000||But what we didn't and couldn't agree is that there'd be a war, now, could we?! My custom's been cut in four!
    500972|00000000||Quite a coincidence that's what I aim to do to you.
    498583|00000000||Splendid! I've finally managed to sell the house. At a jolly good price, too. As promised, you are owed a commission on the sale. The de Jonkheers never break a word once given.
    498584|00000000||So you said. Thanks.
    498585|00000000||I put the house up for sale but still no offers. I don't know… perhaps word got out something's awry with the place… But do look in on me again.
    498586|00000000||Count on it.
    498581|00000000||Why, greetings to my savior!
    498582|00000000||Greetings, de Jonkheer. How's business?
    453193|00000000||I am the Church of Eternal Fire's agent in these lands. It is my duty to go with you.
    453206|00000000||Fine… Just you, then. The rest stay here with Anna.
    453183|00000000||Going alone.
    453185|00000000||I work alone.
    453187|00000000||This matter concerns us all.
    453191|00000000||We don't know what's in there. Your men'll make a lot of noise, more than I'll make alone.
    453208|00000000||So be it. Let's begin.
    453204|00000000||Lemme go in first. Give you a shout if I find anything interesting.
   1074191|00000000||Been down there. Creepy place. I should go first.
    453181|00000000||I'll go first.
    448696|00000000||Did you learn anything?
    448702|00000000||Just as I thought - the Crones probably cursed your mother. Took a lock of her hair, then disappeared down the stairs. Cellar under the house, cellar door's hidden.
    453179|00000000||In that case, we've no time to lose. Come.
   1018057|00000000||Talking to strangers is bad luck.
   1029071|00000000||I repeat - do not get in my way.
   1029072|00000000||That a threat?
   1041430|00000000||Duke's only givin' you a bit of advice. But if it's threats you want--
   1041432|00000000||Heel, Earl. I'm not talkin' to you.
   1015955|00000000||You spat on a Skelliger's honor! Won't get away with it!
   1016199|00000000||Please, don't hit me!
    427115|00000000||Sailors sound this in fog, to warn their crews about rocks they spot.
    427117|00000000||No use to me now.
    427111|00000000||The horn to drive away the sirens. Might come in handy.
   1072431|00000000||Hm, probably planned to repair it.
    522396|00000000||Got hit good…
    522404|00000000||Kept going… though he could barely walk.
    524408|00000000||Sliced her up… Two men, looks like.
    420192|00000000||The Undvik Massacre, they call it - no exaggeration there.
    421298|00000000||Lots of old tracks. Giant must've come through here often…
    524132|00000000||Scavengers got to this one.
    524370|00000000||Giant tried to get inside… Looks like he gave up.
    422614|00000000||Sirens swooped down on 'em… probably knocked them off the bridge.
    416899|00000000||Giant tracks.
    309574|00000000||"Sea graves." How the islanders bury their fallen.
    518018|00000000||Tunnel caved in…
    524396|00000000||Clean cut. Head probably went flying.
   1072406|00000000||Hjalmar's man. Bled to death while trying to escape. Wonder what happened to his cohorts…
    309604|00000000||Signs of a battle.
    524140|00000000||Broken back. As if he fell from a height.
    522462|00000000||Archer finally caught up to him.
    522521|00000000||Took a second arrow here. Got him good this time.
    522522|00000000||Now where'd that archer go?
    522437|00000000||Hm. Made it quite a ways…
    523591|00000000||Must be one of Hjalmar's men…
    522268|00000000||One arrow in each… Good eye.
    522269|00000000||Nekkers slowed the pursuer.
    522317|00000000||Archer was determined to kill him… Wonder why.
    522316|00000000||Someone used this as cover.
    524212|00000000||Hjalmar's encampment. They were attacked.
    523532|00000000||Trolls dragged him into the cave. Wonder if he's still alive.
    309578|00000000||Someone dragged a litter through here.
    417761|00000000||Giant came down the mountain, barged into the village… then kicked the gate down from the inside.
    522245|00000000||Shot him as he fled…
    523546|00000000||Cornered him. Like a hunter.
    522216|00000000||Didn't come back for his arrows.
    447356|00000000||Boiled to death…
    518382|00000000||Bled to death…
    309606|00000000||They fought the giant here.
    524412|00000000||Shot half a quiver into her.
    517980|00000000||Fought to the bitter end.
    517314|00000000||Giant chased them…
    518017|00000000||Rest of the crew went on… Wonder how many were left.
    518019|00000000||Hjalmar lost a lot of men here.
    309586|00000000||Several men… Dragged a boat north.
    524139|00000000||Many wounds, must've fought for a long time.
    420302|00000000||Need to find another way.
    413563|00000000||Try to break through.
    309580|00000000||Wonder what caused the avalanche.
    524144|00000000||Didn't even manage to draw his sword…
    420033|00000000||Show me a pantry, and I'll show you the mice.
    522418|00000000||Lost a lot of blood, couldn't have gone much further.
    309584|00000000||Clan an Craite.
    524087|00000000||Hmm... something cooking over there.
    524136|00000000||Severed artery, bled to death in seconds.
    309576|00000000||Clan an Craite emblem. Must be Hjalmar's longboat.
    310732|00000000||Damn corpse-eaters.
    522372|00000000||Bleeding heavily… strength probably waning.
    522373|00000000||Got hit here first, but kept going.
    417272|00000000||They ran towards the caves…
    417278|00000000||Blood. Lots of it.
   1072363|00000000||These tracks're older. Somebody left the camp before the attack…
    309592|00000000||Two people came through here… Separately.
    524131|00000000||Throat torn open by claws. Sirens…
    417280|00000000||Blood trail leads to the cave.
    417274|00000000||Someone tripped and fell - but managed to get away.
    309582|00000000||Impaled him on a tree…
    524409|00000000||Didn't make it out in time. Two sirens less.
    524413|00000000||Split her in two.
    523664|00000000||Archer was wounded, too.
    522209|00000000||Landed smack in a nekker's lair and cut the beast down. Hardy folk, these Skelligers.
    524135|00000000||Fought barefoot - sirens caught them by surprise.
   1039808|00000000||That was not bad, but we've work to do, still. I don't know… more fire!
   1039809|00000000||But let's pause for now. Rest a bit.
    501547|00000000||Where do ye want to go? Golden Sturgeon or the Seven Cats?
    501548|00000000||I'll not set foot in the Sturgeon. The scum they employ to serve patrons there--
    501549|00000000||Heheh. Admit it. You've eyes for that servin' wench at the Cats.
    501550|00000000||You're to return for rehearsal. Today, is that clear?
    502165|00000000||Not to worry. We'll be there…
    502169|00000000||Dancing and prancing as required.
   1042849|00000000||Almost. That was almost it, but-but--
   1042851|00000000||Well? What was wrong that time?
   1042853|00000000||I don't know anymore… It simply needs more fire!
   1048372|00000000||Murderous venom he did seep in his ear! The traitor!
   1042865|00000000||Defenseless, in slumber - yet his life he did abduct? Vile villain!
   1042863|00000000||Yes, splendid! That! That is what we need more of!
   1048377|00000000||And now the kingdom's crown he wears… He will die this very night, to thee this I swear!
   1042857|00000000||We must flee, my beloved! Guards approach, we are undone!
   1042859|00000000||Forget me not, remember! Avenge me, my son.
   1048379|00000000||And now I vanish. Poof - right?
   1042847|00000000||No, no, wrong!
    429248|00000000||Mmm… the muscle, the sinews, the fat… deliciousss… Sluuurp…
    429250|00000000||You reek of fear. You'll spoil our feast.
    429246|00000000||We'll cut you up, boy. A fine broth you will make.
   1070020|00000000||Philippa? What the hell're you doing here?
   1070022|00000000||Geralt… Don't ask questions you know the answers to. It makes you look stupid.
   1070031|00000000||Maybe not easily… but I think I'll manage.
   1070037|00000000||Might be tough to trick… but I think I'll manage.
   1070039|00000000||Hm. I hope you will take a more serious approach to confronting the Wild Hunt… provided, of course, you survive long enough to undertake it.
   1070054|00000000||What's the catch?
   1070056|00000000||What's the catch?
   1070058|00000000||There is none.
   1070064|00000000||Philippaaa… I know you too damn well. Always got a plan, always got at least two irons in the fire.
   1070066|00000000||This time I shall be content with one - Radovid's head planted at its end.
   1070072|00000000||Good luck, Geralt. You'll need it.
   1070061|00000000||Helpful. Thanks.
   1070063|00000000||Don't mention it. Believe me, I'm prepared to do much more to be rid of Radovid.
   1070053|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1070041|00000000||Philippa… Why even tell me this? Concerned about me that much?
   1070043|00000000||Not at all. It's because I think it vital that Radovid die.
   1070045|00000000||You don't want my help - more's the pity. But I shall do what I can to make certain you don't fuck it up.
   1070047|00000000||Here. Take this.
   1070050|00000000||A ring… Redanian eagle etched in the ruby.
   1070052|00000000||It belonged to Vizimir, Radovid's father. Hand him that, and he may believe you captured me. He might even choose to trust you.
   1070033|00000000||Radovid's lost his mind. Doesn't think rationally anymore. That's why--
   1070035|00000000||That is why he may very well choose to torture you, even if you brought me to him in chains. Just because.
   1070030|00000000||Radovid's crazy. Doesn't think rationally anymore.
   1070025|00000000||Eavesdropping on your conversation, naturally. With a good deal of interest… and a measure of wonder.
   1070027|00000000||Mind telling me what you found puzzling?
   1070029|00000000||Your naiveté. Do you honestly believe Radovid will fall for such a crude ruse?
   1054292|00000000||As they say, a bard must be a quick talker, and a witcher a quick stalker! All's in order!
    421124|00000000||What did you wanna talk about?
    421126|00000000||I got a strange message. I don't quite know what to think.
    424690|00000000||Who was it from?
    421128|00000000||Ingrid Vegelbud's servant. Apparently Lady Vegelbud's prepared to donate a tidy sum. She wants to help mages escape from Novigrad.
    433039|00000000||Guessing this wouldn't be a selfless act of charity.
    433041|00000000||You guess right - and that's my problem. Vegelbud needs a favor, from me… No details in the letter, unfortunately.
    433055|00000000||I'm supposed to meet the servant at the fish market. Says he needs to explain everything face to face, but these days I can't be sure meeting him's a good idea.
    421134|00000000||Don't go near this.
   1003986|00000000||Don't go near this, Triss. It's too risky.
   1003988|00000000||A Vegelbud was murdered recently - I know this. Their place must be crawling with guardsmen.
   1003990|00000000||All the more reason to act quickly. If this is about a mage who's in danger…
   1003992|00000000||Sure it's not time you took a step back? Just had a very close scrape - need I remind you?
   1003994|00000000||If you don't want to help - tough.
    421178|00000000||I don't think you should contact this man.
    424777|00000000||I'd like at least to check… My guess is this could be about a mage who needs help.
    424779|00000000||Seems suspicious, and you just had a close scrape. Sure it's not time let one go?
    430462|00000000||And let the hunters grab the mages who remain here? Out of the question. If you don't want to help - tough.
    430452|00000000||Triss, this is foolish. They catch you, and you won't be there to help anyone else. Promise me you won't go alone.
    430464|00000000||I'd hoped to go with you.
    430489|00000000||If you change your mind, come and see me.
    430493|00000000||I'll think about it.
    430450|00000000||Don't do this.
    430448|00000000||Fine. I'll go with you.
    433062|00000000||Whose idea was this?
    433094|00000000||Whose idea you think this was - the servant's or Vegelbud's?
    433096|00000000||My bet's on Ingrid. High-born damsels have a lot more time than their servants to read adventure novels.
    433104|00000000||Think it'll be better if I talk to the mystery man in the blue tunic.
    433106|00000000||He's expecting to meet me.
    433108|00000000||You just wait nearby. I'll make sure that note didn't come from the witch hunters. Then you come in.
    433110|00000000||Mhm, fine. Let's meet there.
    433064|00000000||Gotta be kidding me… He tell you to come holding a red rose?
    433080|00000000||He doesn't mention flowers, but I won't refuse if you feel like giving me some.
    433082|00000000||It's a fish market, Triss. Be able to get you some salted cod at best.
    433060|00000000||You're joking, right?
    421148|00000000||Don't like this at all… But you seem determined - not about to let you deal with it alone.
    421150|00000000||Thank you.
    424754|00000000||The servant - how're you supposed to contact him?
    421152|00000000||Said I'd recognize him - he'll be in a blue tunic, have a load of keys strapped to his belt. I'm supposed to ask him about the price for his trout.
    421136|00000000||Lemme help you.
    437713|00000000||When I didn't know what it's like to be tortured, what it's like to hear the screams of others and be unable to do anything…
    437715|00000000||You could've escaped at any time.
    437717|00000000||I know! But I was still terrified! What if they fetter me in real dimeritium? You won't always be there to help.
    437723|00000000||When I didn't know what happens when the witch hunters get their hands on you…
    421140|00000000||What're you afraid of, exactly?
    424738|00000000||That it's a trap. On the one hand, it's an opportunity I can't afford to let slip - we need the coin. On the other…
    430011|00000000||Nobody expects you to risk your life.
    430013|00000000||I expect that of myself. The thing is, it used to be easier.
    421138|00000000||What're you afraid of?
    434885|00000000||Who's Ingrid Vegelbud?
    434887|00000000||Who's this Ingrid Vegelbud?
    434889|00000000||The Vegelbuds are one of city's most influential families. Somewhat atypical - the women have been in charge for generations.
    434891|00000000||Patricia Vegelbud's the current materfamilias. Ingrid's her daughter.
    434898|00000000||Know her personally?
    434902|00000000||No, seen her, that's all. And I've heard rumors. She's admired in Novigrad - for her business acumen.
   1000062|00000000||And adored for the lavish balls she throws at the family estate outside town.
    434904|00000000||Though the balls probably serve her business interests in some way.
    421181|00000000||Given some thought to Ingrid Vegelbud's offer.
    421183|00000000||And? Will you help me?
    421179|00000000||Want to tell me something?
    498893|00000000||Whoreson's men raided the Putrid Grove.
    498894|00000000||Ooh, must've pissed off Bedlam!
    500899|00000000||Word is some mages died.
    384182|00000000||Bitch is in a proper fury. Needs a man!
   1055668|61e6661e||Endrega Warrior
    446382|00000000||I'm at the top. Nothing here that looks like a laboratory.
    446384|00000000||Then you've not reached the highest level. Look for a passage.
    446378|00000000||Yes.
    446380|00000000||Search it thoroughly.
    446372|00000000||Where are you? Have you got to the laboratory at the top of the tower yet?
    335068|00000000||Don't start, Anabelle! Back to your crafts! Always bending my ear about fool peasants! I'll not hear of them again!
    453427|00000000||That simpleton turned your head! But one Graham hardly makes the rest courtly, one and all.
    335084|00000000||My lord! Peasants! They're through the door, in the tower!
   1026195|00000000||Good luck.
   1023948|00000000||I don't need this.
   1023951|00000000||Thanks, but I don't need this.
   1023952|00000000||Aenaf.
   1023949|00000000||Thanks.
   1023950|00000000||Daelch edo.
   1023947|00000000||Thanks. I accept your gift.
   1023944|00000000||Diaelch ifi chi.
   1023945|00000000||This for me?
   1023946|00000000||Fyndeg efi, daelch chi.
   1052495|00000000||You hear our latest orders?
   1052497|00000000||Mhm. Kill every fifth prisoner. Whether he's been tried or not. Whoever's drawn, burns.
   1052511|00000000||We haven't got the wood to make that many pyres! Who issued this order?
   1052512|00000000||King himself. Means it as a warning. Folk need to know that for every sorceress rescued, dozens more'll die.
   1066574|00000000||Tried to run, but got stuck in the bog… Great target for an arbalist.
   1068256|00000000||Black hair… Not who I'm looking for.
   1066567|00000000||Got a notice. These men were executed for cowardice…
   1066565|00000000||Definitely didn't die in a fight… Never known soldiers to go into battle with their hands bound.
   1068254|00000000||Red… Just extinguished the mother's last ray of hope…
   1074415|00000000||Fled into the swamp.
   1074413|00000000||Deserters tried to flee on horseback. Were caught here, looks like…
   1066569|00000000||Letter to his mother… Least I can do is get it to her. But that's it.
   1067328|00000000||That's not him…
   1075872|00000000||Red hair… Probably him. Need to find something else to know for sure.
   1066571|00000000||Dog tracks… It's as if they were pursued.
    544167|00000000||Dragonsroot… Wonder if it can really help the old man see the future…
   1052931|00000000||What can I get you, madam? A compass? A straight edge? Going cheap, limited time offer.
   1052933|00000000||Why would I want these strange instruments?
   1052935|00000000||Well… Perhaps you wish to measure something… Draw perfect circles…
   1052937|00000000||Don't listen to him, ma'am. Students left him that rubbish when they went. He tries to push it on everyone, now.
    476419|00000000||Inn at the Crossroads. You bought us a round.
    476423|00000000||As I recall, you were to go your separate way.
   1013342|00000000||Gonna let me in or not?
   1013343|00000000||Eh, no passage for the likes of you.
   1013347|00000000||I'll be back.
   1042889|00000000||Fine. Maybe another time.
    366897|00000000||Right. Guess I'll be going.
    366895|00000000||Got lost. Sorry. Bye.
    366893|00000000||I did. Led me here.
    348805|00000000||It led me here. Gotta talk to the baron.
    348807|00000000||Oh, aye? What about?
    348809|00000000||Something important. His ears only.
    383172|00000000||Fine. Lodrin, let 'im in.
    476450|00000000||If he makes any trouble… well, we outnumber 'im.
    383220|00000000||Open the gate!
    476454|00000000||Sergeant!
    408822|00000000||Ardal! Witcher to see the baron!
    383232|00000000||Don't want no disturbances, that clear?
    408824|00000000||What do you think?
   1042891|00000000||Seems to me we oughta be able to come to some sort of agreement.
   1042900|00000000||Hm, all right, in you go. But cause any trouble and we'll gut you faster than you can say "Nilfgaardian vendetta."
   1013346|00000000||Sure we can't come to an agreement?
    513309|00000000||Thought you were supposed to go your separate way, nice and all.
    513307|00000000||Inn at the Crossroads. You was there not so long ago.
    476415|00000000||Seen this man before.
    476445|00000000||Baron home?
    476447|00000000||Depends who's askin'.
    348801|00000000||A witcher. Wanna talk to him.
    348803|00000000||Hmph, yeah. And I wanna plough the lovely Queen Cerro.
   1071358|155f3fed||Torch
    520907|00000000||Ever play gwent?
    520908|00000000||I do, and what's more, I usually win. If you've a deck, sit down. Outplay me, and I'll give you one of my unique cards. How's that for enticement?
    521054|00000000||Let's lay 'em down.
    520914|00000000||Let's play.
    520916|00000000||We'll play another time.
    520915|00000000||Not now.
    520912|00000000||In the mood for a round of gwent?
    520913|00000000||Haha! I'm always in the mood for gwent.
    520906|00000000||Let's play gwent.
   1076373|00000000||Ah, you won. A man's only as good as his word - take the card. I fear Velen's short on worthy opponents. Boat builder in Oreton might be one. There was also an old soothsayer, lived east of here near the windmill, last I heard.
   1076871|00000000||There's a lad... about as reasonable as an old mare, but he plays a devilish hand. In fact, I don't rightly know that you're ready for him.
    521020|00000000||You're not complete shite, but you really should work on your technique. Stop by again sometime, we'll play another round.
    520917|00000000||You win. Well, made my bed, now I've got to lie in it. There's your card.
    520918|00000000||Thanks. Few ever come into rarities like this.
    521015|00000000||Hm. I've heard of a dwarf in Novigrad - Zoltan… surname escapes me. And there's a traveling cobbler who clings to the Nilfgaardians like he was the stench from their foot wrappings.
    510377|00000000||They say the Isles are at war with Nilfgaard. Bloody lies.
    510201|00000000||Tis a miracle you came back at all.
    510202|00000000||Not all of us did.
    510381|00000000||Goddamn pirates.
    533976|00000000||Wait and see, cunt. I'll carve your mug so not even a blind man'll put his cock anywhere near it.
    533977|00000000||I'll do the cuttin' you come any closer!
    533978|00000000||Wrong kind o' lip, whore!
    390240|00000000||Why don't you wanna talk about Johnny? One of you knows about him - the others must too.
    390242|00000000||It's just him who's pals with Johnny. They pick mushrooms. And hunt snails. But Gran says Johnny's made up.
    390244|00000000||Have you ever seen Johnny?
    390250|00000000||Have any of you ever seen Johnny?
    390252|00000000||Course. Looks just like him.
    416561|00000000||Then why do you say he's made up?
    390254|00000000||Gran says so, and Gran knows lots.
    390246|00000000||Gran ever hurt you?
    390256|00000000||Does your gran treat you right? She ever hurt you?
    390258|00000000||Never.
    390260|00000000||When we're bad, she cries.
    416563|00000000||She's scared, says strangers might take us… and we'll disappear.
    390248|00000000||Your friend's not afraid to go in the woods. Why?
    390264|00000000||The boy who plays with Johnny - he must be brave.
    390266|00000000||Not brave, just stupid.
    390268|00000000||Sat his bare bum on an anthill once. But, yeah, he plays with Johnny. He don't listen to Gran and goes in the woods, and then he's gotta have a time-out.
    390335|00000000||And he eats snails. Yuck.
    390333|00000000||Help me out?
    390337|00000000||The girl I mentioned is in danger. You gotta help me get your gran away from the hut so I can talk to Johnny's friend.
    390339|00000000||All right, but you gotta do somethin' for us, too. Play hide-n-seek. Gran never does, says her feet hurt.
    386113|00000000||I have some treats.
    385701|00000000||Here's some treats.
    385703|00000000||Yum!
    400816|00000000||Never eatin' nothin' like this before in me life!
    386115|00000000||I don't have any treats.
    385697|00000000||Fine, let's play.
    390341|00000000||Let me see if I can find some treats.
    385699|00000000||I'll be back.
    526401|00000000||Don't have any treats.
    526403|00000000||Well here's what you can do: go get some, play hide-n-seek with us, or get lost.
    385689|00000000||Is there something else you need or want?
    385691|00000000||Hmm... I want... something sweet!
    390327|00000000||Me too!
    390329|00000000||Or fruits...
    390331|00000000||Give us a treat and we'll help you.
    385667|00000000||Isn't there something else you want?
    385665|00000000||Fine.
    390343|00000000||Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
    420407|00000000||Ready or not, here I come.
    385673|00000000||One, two, three...
    385669|00000000||Let's play. You hide, but if I find you, you have to help me talk to the boy who knows Johnny.
    385671|00000000||He thinks he'll find us easy.
    390325|00000000||Means he's never hid from the Black Ones.
    420405|00000000||No lookin', and you have to count out loud - all your fingers. Toes, too.
    386111|00000000||Let's play.
    526399|00000000||Have you brought us some treats, or do you wanna play hide-n-seek?
   1020936|00000000||Bastard! Arsehole! Cockeyed prick! You're dead!
   1020937|00000000||I didn't want to hurt her, I promise!
   1027370|00000000||Someone, anyone, help!
   1027074|00000000||Help! Save me!
    586173|00000000||Wow! My dad used to make swords like yours. Can I touch it?
    592901|00000000||It's sharp, better not.
    592903|00000000||Need to talk to your father.
    586175|00000000||I forged swords once. Now it's scythes and hoes. For good arms, you'll need to go to Novigrad.
   1002334|00000000||Did you get a good look at the other woman? Know who it was?
   1002336|00000000||No, she walked in front of Aunt Hanna. I couldn't see.
   1002332|00000000||Who was with Hanna?
    586006|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
    471786|00000000||Farewell.
    471784|00000000||Need to ask you about Hanna.
    471788|00000000||Wanted to ask you about Hanna. Heard she looked after your children.
    592947|00000000||Aunt Hanna? Do you know where she is?
    592949|00000000||No, that's why I'm here. She maybe tell you where she was going? Or anything else?
    471790|00000000||Hmm… She said turnips are healthy and we ought to eat 'em.
    592951|00000000||I saw her go to the forest! With another lady! It was dawn almost - I'd gone out so I wouldn't wet the pallet.
    471794|00000000||The forest? She's done for.
    471796|00000000||Why?
    592953|00000000||A huge pack roams the area. None from the village dares go in the forest. Niellen's only one not afeared, but then he's a hunter…
    471782|00000000||Can I help you someways?
    327272|00000000||That'd be it down here. Time to see Dijkstra.
    350925|00000000||Found pieces of the bomb.
    350935|00000000||Seems to me a bomb blew the wall open. Look.
    385231|00000000||Bottom of a silver cylinder, probably. Covered in runes… Interesting… Any idea what it contained?
    351181|00000000||Recognized some ingredients by their scent - wyvern oil and sugar.
    376702|00000000||Sugar?! Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests.
    378962|00000000||Guess I could be wrong. Smell was weak, barely detectable.
    378954|00000000||Could be wrong.
    378952|00000000||Nor am I. That's what I observed.
    378956|00000000||Nor am I. Just saying what I found - bomb contained sugar.
    425219|00000000||Let's think… Sugar would react violently with sulfuric acid… But not so violently to cause an explosion.
    425221|00000000||Didn't know you were versed in alchemy.
    425223|00000000||Dabbled in it a bit while at Oxenfurt Academy… But this is no time to reminisce. You're to find my treasure, not write my biography.
    426057|00000000||Know anything else about this bomb? Anything at all?
    350939|00000000||Drain pipe's our only promising lead. We just need to known which pool it's connected to.
    327330|00000000||Yes… Happen keeps a record of guests, should be able to tell us who used that pool the day of the break-in… You've not done badly.
    379137|00000000||Feel honored to be acknowledged.
    379139|00000000||Oh, that famous sarcasm… I'd missed it.
    486723|00000000||Really?
    486725|00000000||Mhm. About as much as I'd miss a knife in my knickers.
    379143|00000000||All right. You inspect the pools on the right, I'll take the ones on the left. Holler if you find anything!
    350931|00000000||Let's see which drain they dropped the bomb down.
    358862|00000000||Bomb went off inside a drainage pipe embedded in the vault wall. But the grate at the end of the pipe was in place when the blast happened, meaning…
    358868|00000000||The bomb must have found its way into the pipe from inside the bathhouse.
    358870|00000000||Exactly. Mighta gone something like this: perpetrator started emptying one of the pools, then dropped the bomb down the drain…
    425255|00000000||The bomb flowed down with the run-off, came to rest on the grate and, to quote Bart - big boom.
    358850|00000000||Bomb was inside the pipe.
    378983|00000000||Found a second corpse - one of the thieves. Threw up the antidote, just like your man Fonce.
    378985|00000000||A beautiful death. Anything on the body?
    378987|00000000||Not much. Empty vial.
    378989|00000000||Hmm… Wouldn't have left him behind if he was anybody. Common porter, must be. Knew nothing, means nothing. Dead end. Literally!
    378950|00000000||Found one of the thieves' corpses.
    363568|00000000||Thieves loaded the treasure onto a boat.
    363570|00000000||Bits of the treasure dropped out of the crates. Left a clear trail. You know, like the fairy tale… with the crumbs.
    363572|00000000||Mhm. I know the one. Hansel, Gretel, burning witches. Very fitting for Novigrad.
    363574|00000000||Trail leads to the river where the sewer lets out… Breaks off there. My bet - they loaded the treasure onto a boat.
    376738|00000000||Yes, a cart drawn by sewer rats does seem unlikely. And since boats don't leave trails… it amounts to fuck all.
   1042085|00000000||I hope we won't meet again.
    481189|00000000||Hoof it! Hoof it!
    370507|00000000||What're you starin' at?! Fuck off! Git!
    370509|00000000||Doppler belongs in the fire, not on stage!
    370761|00000000||And you belong in a sty, swine! Go home, your goat's arse misses you!
   1069246|00000000||Something bad happened inside. Best go in and see.
    571734|00000000||Whoa there! Greetin's!
    571736|00000000||Serpent eyes, silver sword…
    571738|00000000||A witcher, as I live and breathe!
   1054941|00000000||When I grow up, I want to be a witcheress!
   1055846|00000000||You're stupid! Lasses can't be witchers or witcheresses.
   1055848|00000000||Who says so?
   1055850|00000000||Everybody knows it.
   1055852|00000000||Mum says "everybody" means as much as "nobody." I'm gonna be a witcheress and that's that.
   1054943|00000000||Wonder if the ratcatcher'll get well.
   1054945|00000000||Like as not.
   1055831|00000000||How do you know?
   1055833|00000000||Mum says that if he but catches a cough, he's as good as in the grave. And this one's got a fever.
   1051398|00000000||{Cot'caer, eabarë straede y ragah blàr... } [Filthy hovels, sodden roads and weed-ridden fields...]
   1051400|00000000||{Esse mòran arbaith hwer. Oh, mòran. } [A lot of work awaits us here. A whole lot.]
   1051402|00000000||{Fhearë evellienn pràbar esse'fògair. Y esse'àraich a'vean klaaran. } [It would be better to drive this rabble off. Bring in our own settlers.]
   1051404|00000000||{Ess a leith deilbh. An tùs phem'va Redania fògair aep Pontarr. } [There are plans in place to do just that. But first we must drive the Redanians off, away from the Pontar.]
    455547|00000000||Arms! To arms! Monsters a-comin'!
    408740|00000000||Rally to me, boys!
   1068467|00000000||Bodies were buried in the woods…
   1068469|00000000||Ghouls dug them up.
   1068471|00000000||Buried the Redanian prisoners in the woods.
   1068473|00000000||Ghouls dug them up.
    448217|00000000||Seagulls! Hear them? We made it!
    448219|00000000||C'mon. We need to ready the ship before the hunters learn what's happening.
    422904|00000000||Don't kill me… Got kids… Three…
    426628|00000000||You knew the risks.
    426630|00000000||Thre-- three children…
    423201|00000000||I will not kill this man!
   1004888|00000000||Heard them Nilfgaardians are altogether different.
   1004889|00000000||How so? They got different cocks or what?
   1004890|00000000||Their smell - supposed to be different than our men's.
   1004891|00000000||I wonder which scag's whorin' herself to Black Ones, then spreadin' this babble…
    562829|00000000||Radovid's not paying you to loaf about, now, is he?
   1046339|00000000||I just want some placards.
   1046341|00000000||Take what you want, I'm just here for some placards.
   1046343|00000000||You deaf? Didn't you hear me? This is all mine now! Fuck off, freak!
   1046345|00000000||Huh, and here I thought we'd resolve this peacefully.
   1046351|00000000||You're not gonna rob him.
   1046353|00000000||Strange, don't recall askin' your permission. Get 'im, Fred!
   1046338|00000000||Can't let you steal from him.
   1046329|00000000||Looking for Rautlec.
   1046331|00000000||You ain't alone. Damn halfling's in debt to half the city. But I'm here to scrape mine 'fore the carcass is picked clean.
   1047727|00000000||There's not enough for everyone, so bugger off. Feedin' time's first-come, first-served.
    482581|00000000||Strange stuff… A doll… Drawing shows it lying in a cradle.
    493623|00000000||Maybe I should find one.
    483305|00000000||There was a cradle on the second floor.
    493626|00000000||Wonder what'd happen if I laid a doll in it…
