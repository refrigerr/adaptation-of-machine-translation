    593592|00000000||Hey, everyone! Wanna hear about Fyresdal?
    593596|00000000||Hey, good folk! Wanna hear what our brave guard did at Fyresdal?
    593598|00000000||Shut your trap, dammit!
    591702|00000000||Four against one - and you came out alive.
    591704|00000000||Shame to let such a lad waste away behind bars… Come on. Maybe Lugos'll try you today.
    591705|00000000||And they say violence is never the answer…
    593600|00000000||How the hell did you know about it?
    593602|00000000||From Simun Brambling. He promised to forget if you take me to see the jarl.
    593604|00000000||Bramblin'! More like Simun Loose-lip. Ah, fine, come with me.
    593594|00000000||It'll cost you. Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
    593591|00000000||It'll cost you.
    591686|00000000||You bored? Grab a pickaxe.
    591687|00000000||Rather talk. About what happened at Fyresdal, for example.
    591699|00000000||Shut it!
   1077251|00000000||Hey, Grayhair! Lemme out, eh?! You've but to find the key!
    587823|00000000||How about a round of gwent?
    587824|00000000||Fine, let's play. But you're not to speak.
   1016317|00000000||Care for a game of cards?
    587822|00000000||See ya.
   1016320|00000000||I'd prefer "goodbye."
    587803|00000000||Farewell.
    587812|00000000||Got anything you're willing to sell?
    587825|00000000||Got anything to sell?
   1016325|00000000||I do. But it's expensive.
   1016316|00000000||What do you want now? I've taught you all I know.

    567932|00000000||Geralt, we need him alive.
    567933|00000000||Figured as much. Help me.
    583682|00000000||Just warmin' up. Well, what're you waiting for? Go call the next one.
    425869|00000000||Let's go, next.
    410018|00000000||A witcher, eh? Ye fight more like a little bitch. Get outta my sight, drifter.
    583686|00000000||Throat's dry… Going for a drink.
    583688|00000000||Go. But I hope to fight you again.
    425871|00000000||Goin' for a drink.
    410016|00000000||Argh, pth! You hit good. Hard.
    478312|dbb86633||Bandit
    582904|00000000||Oh, 'tis a bad turn, bad…
    577289|c10c4bf2||Fisherman
    446094|00000000||Don't know what you came here seekin', wanderer… But death's what you've found.
    446180|00000000||I get his blades! And whichever one of yous fights best'll get his armor!
   1044788|00000000||Fannar wrote he's willin' to pay well for the sword. Its weight in gold, in fact.
   1044790|00000000||Kuliu's worth more. Lots more.
   1044792|00000000||I don't deny it. But none other's prepared to buy. They all fear the an Craite.
    446092|00000000||At 'im! Asulf, go 'round behind!
   1063144|00000000||Geralt, stop dawdling! Don the damned Mask!
   1063142|00000000||Put on the Mask. We don't have time.
    545346|391ece5b||Boatwright
   1072727|00000000||Gotta keep looking. Hjalmar came through here, had to.
    420027|00000000||Recruited quite a few men… No Hjalmar here, though.
    420031|00000000||Giant's pantry.
   1050103|00000000||I'll never forget what you did for us!

    578437|00000000||You ever play gwent?
   1008173|00000000||Hah! Ermion taught me the rules and gave me a deck. Wish to play?
    578443|00000000||We'll play another time.
    578442|00000000||Some other time.
    578441|00000000||Let's play.
    578444|00000000||Let's play a quick round.
    578436|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
    578447|00000000||You're good! Know what, Wolf? I've this rare card here - take it, it'll be of more use to you.
   1042372|00000000||Thanks.
   1076491|00000000||You might consider challenging a man in Kaer Trolde village. A worthy adversary, though a mere tailor. Sjusta's his name.
    578446|00000000||Not shabby. But you could use some better cards.
   1042374|00000000||Ermion mentioned the druid Gremist. Apparently has similar rare beauties, as does some hermit in Velen. Pay them a visit if you care to expand your collection.
   1024674|00000000||Been to Lofoten. More graves there than men. To think it could've been us they ravaged…
   1024676|00000000||We'd 'uve fought 'em off. Everyone knows Larvik's got better warriors.
   1024678|00000000||Stupider, maybe. Sonny… if the Naglfar had landed here, you'd be dead and rotten now.
   1017241|00000000||Who're you? Ah, wait, you I know. Geralt of Rivia, aye? What is it?
    320709|00000000||Farewell.
    320707|00000000||Farewell.
   1016830|00000000||How are things on Faroe?
   1017247|00000000||How are things on Faroe?
   1017249|00000000||They're as always - it's pissin' buckets and fuckin' freezin'.
   1017251|00000000||See you're bursting with pride.
   1017253|00000000||No use coatin' seal shit with honey. Faroe is a rock overgrown with pines, but we've no need for more.
   1017255|00000000||Can't eat pinewood.
   1017257|00000000||But use it to build a longship, and you'll eat your fill of what others've grown and bred. After you've taken their wenches and their gold, burned their homes to the ground. That's how Clan Dimun lives.
   1017243|00000000||Aye?
   1074011|00000000||Got a trail to follow. Wonder where it leads.
   1002812|00000000||Another victim.
   1002814|00000000||That stench… Drowners for sure. Lair must be nearby.
   1002878|00000000||Crabs… Must be near the fishing ground Rurik mentioned.
   1002912|00000000||That stench again… Slime and rotting flesh…
   1002915|00000000||Ooh. More drowners.
   1003006|00000000||A monster's lair… but definitely not a drowner's.
   1003254|00000000||Almost untouched, hidden for later. Drowners just don't do that.
   1003272|00000000||Bruises on his neck, crushed larynx… Strangled.
   1003415|00000000||Bits of boats, torn sails, lines… Sailing decor, you could call it.
   1003462|00000000||That stench, the marks on the bodies… This must be a water hag's lair. Got a keen sense of smell. She won't come back while I'm here.
   1003463|00000000||Unless… She coexists with drowners… Maybe I could make an extract from their glands, cover up my scent.
   1003720|00000000||That should do it. Now for place to hide and wait. Behind those boats…?
   1039089|00000000||Human bones. Unbroken, but the marrow's been sucked out. Need a long, thin tongue for that.
   1045367|00000000||A pelvis, scratched up. Long, wide claw marks.
   1039099|00000000||Rusty piece of armor. Falling apart in my hands…
   1049090|00000000||Talking won't get me anywhere…
   1017978|00000000||Piss off, already, you--! Oh, nay… I-I… My vow of silence! All for naught.
   1021195|00000000||Sorry. I was tricked.
   1021201|00000000||Oh, sorry. Someone tricked me. I thought--
   1021203|00000000||Boo hoo hoo! My deepest sympathies! Now get out of my sight, you imbecile!
   1021197|00000000||I meant well, really…
   1021199|00000000||Well it certainly didn't turn out well! Out of my sight, swine!
   1021194|00000000||I meant well…
   1017979|00000000||Three years! Three years and not a word, not a peep! Until today. You made me break my vow. Happy?!
   1049084|00000000||Are you the silent druid?
   1049086|00000000||…
   1049088|00000000||Oh, yeah. Dumb question.
   1049170|00000000||…
   1049177|00000000||…
   1049185|00000000||When'd you lose your voice? Can you show me, hold up some fingers?
   1049189|00000000||Ah, charming man.
   1049172|00000000||When'd you lose your voice?
   1049175|00000000||Hm, doesn't look like we'll figure much out talking. So long.
   1049173|00000000||Farewell.
   1049171|00000000||They try to cure you some other way?
   1049179|00000000||They ever try to cure you some other way? Give you potions or herbs?
   1049181|00000000||…
   1049183|00000000||Not just mute. Seems he's deaf, too…
   1023377|00000000||Clouds obscure the sky and turmoil grips the sea. Defend us, Great Mother.
   1023379|00000000||This we ask of you, Freya, She-Falcon, Lioness, Bringer of Sun and Rain.
   1023384|00000000||We pour you mead and blood, we offer you victuals. Remember us, Mother, protect our shores.
   1023282|00000000||Porridge again, child? Ye could stand to serve some meat…
   1023284|00000000||What would ye do if I did? Ye ain't got no teeth.
   1023286|00000000||I could suck on it, at least… You could still toss it in a soup afterwards.
   1048859|00000000||I hear Olaf's been off meat for two days.
   1048861|00000000||And when he's hungry, he's angry.
   1048863|00000000||But he's had a helluva lotta mead.
   1048865|00000000||Whoo-hoo… then Olaf's gonna do some killin'.
    475630|00000000||You're mad, woman! Mad, I say!
    475638|00000000||Maybe. But I've got good reason.
    475640|00000000||I hold Ciri dear too. You know this! Damned well! But the Mask of Uroboros is no trifle!
    478557|00000000||Have you any idea what could happen if it is used? Any idea of the consequences?
    478673|00000000||No, but neither do you. So stop panicking.
   1077064|150e14a2||Pirate Leader
    591718|00000000||Hey, hey! What's got into ye?
    591720|00000000||Told 'em… Lockin' a witcher in here's like puttin' a bear in a cage full of hounds.
    592996|00000000||True. Right spectacular in both cases.
    482485|00000000||I'm sorry, but I must get to Drowned Dead Rock… as fast as possible.
    484123|00000000||Shan't force you to stay… But the Rock's a ways off, and you can barely walk. You best take a horse.
    484125|00000000||True! Skjall can prepare a horse for you. You'll have to wait a spell, but even so you'll get there faster than on foot.
    484127|00000000||Fine… That will do. Thank you both very much.
    484885|00000000||Pish-posh, there's no need… Now come, we gotta sweat the sick outta you!
   1056937|00000000||Where are my clothes?
   1056939|00000000||I've taken 'em already. Come on!
    482478|00000000||I must get to Drowned Dead Rock.
    482479|00000000||I feel fine now.
    484131|00000000||Really, there's no need… I feel fine now.
    484134|00000000||Hey!
    484136|00000000||Fine? You can't stand on your own two feet…
    484137|00000000||And it's no surprise with your muscles frozen stiff. But don't you worry… Mum and I will take care of you.
    427868|00000000||Help… help me stand.
    427871|00000000||I don't… I don't think you should--
    427873|00000000||Less talk, more giving me a hand.
    482465|00000000||Ah, that's me brother for you. Outta sight for a second, and he's already put his paws on a girl.
    482467|00000000||Dah. Astrid, you're as dim as dishwater! You know perfectly well I'm helpin' her up.
    482471|00000000||It's a shame, I know, but I've got to interrupt your courtship. Come, we're off to the sauna.
    484082|00000000||Where?
    484084|00000000||Why's your mouth agape like you're noodlin' for an eel? The sauna!
    497869|00000000||Girl… You was blue as a whale when we brought you in here! Your blood needs thawin'!
    386093|00000000||Help me up.
    497284|00000000||What's this?! Did you undress me?!
    497286|00000000||I-- I'd no choice! Soaked through, you were, and I had to see if you'd any wounds that needed tendin'.
    497289|00000000||Mhm. And if my breasts needed smearing with fox tallow…
    497291|00000000||Nay, nay--! Th-that was mum and sis! I-- I'd never dare. I swear. On my honor.
    497293|00000000||Easy. I believe you.
    497281|00000000||What? You undressed me?!
    497302|00000000||Yes… I've been through a lot.
    497304|00000000||I never thought women on the Continent did any fightin'.
    497306|00000000||Sometimes they have no choice.
    497282|00000000||Yeah, a whole lot.
    386075|00000000||How long did I lie there?
    386077|00000000||All day, nearabouts - 'twas morn when we brought you in, night's near come now.
    482453|00000000||Damn… Too long…
    430289|00000000||You needed the rest, desperately.
    497299|00000000||Been through a lot, eh? Got some nasty fresh-lookin' scars…
    386097|00000000||Was I out long?
    386095|00000000||Where is my companion?
    386063|00000000||And where is he? My… friend?
    386065|00000000||Stepped out a while ago. Said he needed to find a boat.
    429741|00000000||Why's he wear that mask? Somethin' not right with his mug?
    386067|00000000||No. He simply doesn't like others to see it.
    482396|00000000||You're awake… And I thought you'd…
    482400|00000000||Where am I? And who are you?
    482473|00000000||It's all right. You're on Hindarsfjall, village of Lofoten. They call me Skjall.
    482475|00000000||But how'd I… What?
    482477|00000000||We fished you out of the sea… Me and that friend of yours.
    438330|00000000||Oh, a witcher! Here about the dragon, I reckon?
    511121|00000000||Yeah. And it had golden scales and smoke poured out its ass like it does out a chimney.
    511123|00000000||Just like the skalds sing it… You've earned your reward.
    511125|00000000||And the princess' hand. But I'll just take the coin.
    511119|00000000||Yeah… and it had golden scales.
    511127|00000000||That was no dragon, it was a forktail. Looks similar, but it's smaller, less dangerous.
    511129|00000000||Less dangerous, you say? Well, your reward ought to be less as well.
    511131|00000000||Listen, we agreed to a specific sum.
    511133|00000000||Aye… for a dragon! If I'd known it was some forkytail, I'd have killed it meself. That's that!
    511093|00000000||It was a forktail, not a dragon.
    381159|00000000||Solved your problem.
    381167|00000000||And…? That it? Tell me more! Did the dragon breathe fire? Spit venom?
    581413|00000000||Problem solved.
    581407|00000000||Found your dragon's nest. But I'll need bait to kill it. A sheep, for instance.
    581410|00000000||Ah, I see. Gonna stuff it with sulfur?
    581411|00000000||Ahh, another ally of the brave little shoemaker… No, I'll manage without sulfur. Just need a sheep. Unseasoned.
    581412|00000000||Fine, there's one I can give ye… A bit mangy, but it'll do. Know how to get a sheep to move where you want? Gotsta drive it like a sheep dog. Go at it from the left, it'll go right. Go at it from the right, it'll--
    591025|00000000||If dogs have figured it out, think I'll manage as well.
    581321|00000000||I need bait.
    511072|00000000||Witchers don't usually kill dragons, but I'll look into it. You said something about victims, right?
   1034968|00000000||Two brothers, Askel and Nilas. Went out to hunt, turned into prey. Wounds so horrible even I went weak in the knees when they brought them in. And I've seen my share of bloody harm - been on thirty-two raids, from Poviss to the mountains of--
   1034970|00000000||Fascinating story, I'm sure, but I'm more interested in these wounds. Can you describe them?
   1034972|00000000||Look for yourself. Family's only now preparin' the boys' funeral. Their corpses still lie in their home, at the village's northern end. But treat the bodies with respect, mind ye. As tradition demands.
    511064|00000000||I'll look into it.
   1068423|00000000||What?! I'll not give ye that, one dragon or many!
   1068425|00000000||You're askin' a few crowns too many, master.
   1068427|00000000||It's a lot… But then a dragon's a lot, too. So be it. I accept!
   1068429|00000000||Enough. Take what I offer or leave it in peace! I'll find a lad, a few, who'll face the dragon for the glory alone!
    511063|00000000||Let's talk about the reward… See, what you're offering for this dragon, usually get that much for a nekker.
    511065|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
    511066|00000000||Need to think it over.
    511068|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    438332|00000000||Farewell.
    438336|00000000||Farewell.
    438334|00000000||About the dragon…
    511070|00000000||Given some thought to your contract…
    443746|00000000||Tell me about this… dragon. What it looks like, for instance.
    443748|00000000||You don't know? What kinda monster slayer are ye? It's got scales, wings, claws… A dragon's a dragon! No point gabbin', just go kill it! 'Fore it makes more corpses!
    511025|00000000||So will ye help with the dragon or not?
    492240|00000000||Give it a year, two - you'll forget them. I'll bear you sons, strong and healthy ones. You'll see.
    492241|00000000||Well? Will you say anythin'?
    492242|00000000||Leave me be, woman. I agreed to come back to ye, not to love ye.
    509663|00000000||You've probably never heard of the place.
    509666|00000000||You've probably never heard of the place.
    509667|00000000||You'd be surprised. But you needn't tell me if you don't want to.
    509673|00000000||It's no secret, actually.
    509674|00000000||In that case, will you tell me later? Over mead, somewhere cozy?
    509677|00000000||Gladly. See you at the inn?
    509678|00000000||Too rowdy. Come to my home, in Harviken. I'll be waiting after dusk.
    513393|00000000||See you later, then.
    509675|00000000||Gladly.
    509679|00000000||Some other time, maybe.
    509680|00000000||Hm. Must admit that was not the answer I expected. Thought you'd want to celebrate your victory.
    513396|00000000||Though, of course, I understand you might be in a rush. Good luck on the Path.
    509676|00000000||Another time, maybe.
    509664|00000000||At Kaer Morhen.
    509665|00000000||Kaer Morhen! That's terribly far. But you learned a great deal on the road as well, surely. Would you tell me about it?
    513341|00000000||It'd make for a long story.
    513342|00000000||All right, we need a quiet spot, some good mead and… What do you say?
    509662|00000000||At Kaer Morhen.
    509659|00000000||Enough! Enough! Oh, gods…
    509660|00000000||Not surprised you have a hard time finding worthy opponents.
    509661|00000000||In the end… one came along… Where'd you learn all that?
    512056|00000000||So? Had enough?
    509654|00000000||Yes.
    509655|00000000||Ugh… I thought I'd finally found a man who could best me.
    509657|00000000||Shouldn't 'ave fought so hard…
    509658|00000000||You know nothing, White One. Now go.
    509737|00000000||Foul! Fraud! Magic and potions to defeat one woman?
    512090|00000000||But…
    512130|00000000||For shame!
   1017985|2537f9a8||Butcher
   1022604|00000000||C'mon, go! Ye gotta touch the whale's skull. Ain't afraid, are ye?
   1022605|00000000||Naye, but…
   1022606|00000000||But what?
   1022607|00000000||C'mon, Yergen, change his dare. He doesn't gotta go to the cemetery, it's haunted.
   1022608|00000000||Cowards! Weaklings! Not about to play with you anymore!
    551475|00000000||Me, I love the rain. Like a whore loves a leper colony.
    550399|00000000||Some sorceress rode up to Kaer Trolde.
    551477|00000000||Folk say 'twas Crach's lover.
    550401|00000000||You don't say…
    550403|00000000||It true he's caught ill again?
    550405|00000000||You're dull as dirt. *Yaaawn*
    551651|00000000||Hm. Greetings.
    551653|00000000||Mhm?
    551667|00000000||Eh?
    551649|00000000||Aaaahhhhh…
    551479|00000000||I know what I'm sayin'! Tight-arse innkeep waters the wine!
    551480|00000000||Go back whence ye came.
    551512|00000000||Watch that jostlin'!
    551655|00000000||Lookin' to rob me? Of what?
    551665|00000000||Hhhhhh… Hhhhhhhh…
    427578|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    427580|00000000||I'm looking for people from Undvik.
    419069|00000000||They're dead.
    522369|00000000||See, now, I heard many survived.
    427576|00000000||Stubborn git, you are… Whaddaya wanna know?
    419071|00000000||You there when the giant attacked?
    419073|00000000||Aye, I was. One of the jarl's personal guards. Egh. I failed him. Lent no credence to what the priestesses said - that we'd be punished.
    496916|00000000||For robbin' the earth of iron, forgin' it into blades that men kill one another with. That Freya would punish us. Mayhaps they spoke the truth…
    419095|00000000||Jarl of Undvik - tell me about his death.
    419097|00000000||Jarl Harald Houndsnout… His whole crew died that night. Wilmar, Wilfred, and Wilhelm…
    419099|00000000||I reached them too late. Saw the giant dash Wilmar against a rock.
    496922|00000000||He fell right beside me, all his bones broke, wrigglin' like a salmon on the sand.
    419101|00000000||Harald was dead by then?
    419103|00000000||What? No, jarl fought like a bear! Slicin', and dodgin', and hollerin', then slicin' again. Couldn't save himself though.
    425006|00000000||Jarl of Undvik - how did he die?
    419107|00000000||I should go.
    421296|00000000||Yeah…
    419085|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    425004|00000000||How'd you manage to survive?
    419155|00000000||How did you manage to survive?
    419157|00000000||First I heard the giant growl to those flying sirens. Damn me if he weren't givin' 'em orders!
    425285|00000000||Under stress, men see all kinds of things…
    419159|00000000||I know what I saw! Rushed to help the jarl, but one of the cunts sunk her talons in me, liftin' me up. Tried to take me to their nest, peck me apart, I reckon.
    419161|00000000||But I broke loose of her grip, plummeted from quite a height. Crashed hard, couldn't stand. Last thing I saw - swarm of sirens swooping down on the jarl, thrashing 'round him. He yipped, he yelped, he screamed, he hollered. Then silence.
    425215|00000000||The men escortin' the women and the children to the ships took my unconscious flesh away and brought me to Ard Skellig.
    419143|00000000||You again… Really got no one else to bother?
    522371|00000000||Go ask Rante or Javor. Or the innkeep.
    338912|9f754b64||Blacksmith
    332382|00365006||Bandit
    170812|f3248005||Water Hag
   1017971|0687b403||Smith
   1028266|00000000||Witcher!
   1028342|00000000||They're missin' - me betrothed, me brothers! Help me, witcher!
   1046778|00000000||Twas Bran's forefather, Torgeir the Red, who sailed up the Alba to the gates of the Nilfgaardian capital… Set the city's outskirts alight.
   1046781|00000000||Emperor was shittin' scared, ooh, aye.
   1046783|00000000||Just a shame he brought great misfortune on his folk by that deed…
   1046932|00000000||The emperor's vengeance was brutal.
   1046934|00000000||The sea turned black with Nilfgaard's sails. They landed on the isle… Hundreds of men. Thousands.
   1046936|00000000||They killed warriors, women, children… And when they were done, they tore every buildin' down. Stone by stone.
   1046938|00000000||And what happened to Torgeir? Did he live?
   1046942|00000000||They took him captive. But the Black Ones didn't know the fiend they had…
   1046944|00000000||Durin' the crossin', he freed himself from his fetters, slew half their crew and threw himself into the sea!
   1049160|00000000||Lighthouse on Eldberg's still dark…
   1049162|00000000||Reckon it'll stay that way.
   1049164|00000000||They say the isle's haunted. Some sort o' wraiths.
   1049166|00000000||Then we best sail over. Clean up the ghostly mess.
   1049168|00000000||A few men tried not long past. Next day their boat washed ashore… empty.
   1072285|130bfe67||Penitent
   1056837|00000000||Show the daft bugger his place! 'Neath the table!
   1056835|00000000||Crush his gob, White One! Pulp it!
   1056849|00000000||Plough 'im in the mug, fist his fuckin' gob! Make him choke on his teeth, already!
   1056839|00000000||Da! Ploughin' beat the bastard down! If you don't, I fuckin' will!
   1056853|00000000||This is grand! Just like the old days! Wake's worthless without a row!
   1056851|00000000||Don't ye go soft on each other! Bloody look lively!
    372790|00000000||Fought to the bitter end, but the sirens were too many.
    379674|00000000||He refused to abandon the flock to the beasts.
    372792|00000000||Ehh, on her death bed me mum asked me to protect him.
    379676|00000000||I was to take his place come morn… If I'd only taken the night watch, he'd still be alive, I reckon.
    513667|00000000||I'll wait here. But hurry.
    515172|00000000||I'll wait at the cave entrance.
    515487|00000000||Hurry, now. Pick up the pace!
    515486|00000000||I'm tellin' you, ploughin' enormous whoreson he is!
    515475|00000000||Can't believe I finally got the bastard.
    518086|00000000||Ploughin' fish-bitches!
    518085|00000000||I'll gut you!
    518084|00000000||Hang in there, Leif! I'll soon finish them off!
    518083|00000000||Die, fishwhores!
    509051|00000000||Crach an Craite asked about you.
    509053|00000000||We went out... for a breath of fresh air.
    509055|00000000||Ahem, the claimants to the throne will step forth in a moment.
    504114|00000000||…Now heed my words. There is no greater act of valor than to fight a beast cursed by men and gods.
    504116|00000000||No greater deed than that done to serve the goddess.
    170890|00000000||Words of uncommon beauty. We thank you and will take them to heart… But now - let's begin!
    353222|00000000||We have seen Bran off into the beyond and must now choose his successor.
    504119|00000000||A king must be wise. A king must command respect. A king must have bollocks. We've no lack of men like that.
    504121|00000000||Let those who feel worthy of the throne of Skellige step forth.
    504124|00000000||My son could not be here this day. Behold his axe. Behold his will.
    504131|00000000||May the best man… or woman… win.
    509064|00000000||What's got into her?
    509066|00000000||She's your daughter, is she not?
    509068|00000000||Now I know why she said she'll sail to Spikeroog. Ah, children! The older they grow, the more trouble they are.
    507135|00000000||Come with me. All the more essential we talk now.
    551641|00000000||Hair's gray, but you're no druid.
    166396|00000000||Steel sizzlin', sparks glistenin', ancient runes in the blade… listenin'? Nahh…
    166408|00000000||Nice blade, that's true.
    551633|00000000||Rain gives me a powerful hunger.
    550365|00000000||Jarl had 'em butcher not one but two flocks!
   1012081|00000000||All so there'd be plenty o' scoff at Bran's wake!
    550367|00000000||Your shittin' me…
    550369|00000000||Well then? We fishin' today or what?
    550371|00000000||Dooon't know.
    551635|00000000||Hey!
    551637|00000000||Didn't recognize you! Hah!
    551639|00000000||Mighty pale mug you got… Hungry or somethin'?
    551647|00000000||Now what?
    551643|00000000||Blunder somewhere else!
    551645|00000000||Mummy!
   1047248|00019bc0||Joe
   1049145|00000000||What became of those nice Faroe lads who went treasure huntin' in the ruins?
   1049147|00000000||I don't know. But I'm afeared we shan't see 'em again.
   1049149|00000000||Uve… why're you talkin' like that?
   1049151|00000000||Went down to the river to do my wash. Got there… water was runnin' red with blood.
   1049153|00000000||Someone mighta been guttin' fish upstream…
   1049155|00000000||Perhaps. We should ask Freya to make it so.
   1028793|00000000||Up for a few rounds of gwent?
   1028792|00000000||Care to play cards?
    421578|00000000||Take care.
    421574|00000000||Farewell.
    421572|00000000||Show me what you got.
    421576|00000000||What're you offering?
    421570|00000000||Greetings, stranger. Have a drink with us.
   1071448|00000000||Asked around already… talked to the wrong people, maybe?
   1071535|00000000||Need to try the village again.
   1071533|00000000||Not likely to learn anymore here.
   1071444|00000000||Hmm… abandoned house Eiric mentioned - high time I had a look.
    457254|00000000||Tellin' ye, Geralt… Crach had a hand in this.
    587984|00000000||Come visit us - we'll show you what a real feast looks like.
    586313|00000000||Everyone needs to hear this. Let's get back to Kaer Trolde.
    586315|00000000||Will you tell the council of jarls of the plot?
    586317|00000000||I will. I was ready to die for Birna… But not like this.
   1070513|00000000||The Thing will need to convene. Let's go!
    586310|00000000||Let's take him to Kaer Trolde.
    586311|00000000||What was Birna's motive?
    588306|00000000||What was her motive?
    588308|00000000||It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
    588310|00000000||If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
   1070516|00000000||And I know the colors those men wore. That was the Clan Tuirseach tartan.
   1070518|00000000||It's her. She's behind all this, isn't she?
   1070521|00000000||Yes. Birna Bran.
    588269|00000000||No an Craite should ever sit on Skellige's throne. I know you better than others do - you're hot-headed, irresponsible…
    588271|00000000||Skellige needs stability, a strong king. Not the kind a band of drunken jarls will choose.
    588273|00000000||Curious. Never heard you voice that idea. But I do know one who never stops saying it.
    589877|00000000||Why did you help me?
    589879|00000000||Because I want to hear why you betrayed my father, my brother and our clan! Say it to my face!
   1025013|00000000||Worst possible claimant won. We'll all regret it, mark my words.
   1025009|00000000||Hjalmar's a fierce and able warrior, that's clear, but he'll never make a good king.
   1025011|00000000||The better claimant won.
   1025007|00000000||What do you think of Skellige's new ruler?
   1025006|00000000||Skellige's new ruler - any thoughts?
    457430|00000000||Remember me, Jarl?
    457432|00000000||I remember, Geralt. I remember.
   1012732|00000000||Forgive me, the gods speak.
    457370|00000000||Farewell.
    169109|00000000||Farewell.
   1012689|00000000||Who do you think'll win the crown?
   1012711|00000000||The fight for the throne's grown fierce.
   1012712|00000000||Strife 'tween siblings is never good. I know from experience.
   1012713|00000000||Hjalmar's ambitious, but to a fault. We'd all be better off were his sister to win.
   1012714|00000000||Really think so, or is that gratitude speaking?
   1012717|00000000||I am grateful, as Hemdall's my witness. No one's ever done more for me than you and that lass.
   1012719|00000000||More important, she showed great cunning and courage. Qualities the Isles need now more than ever.
   1012589|00000000||Geralt, friend. What brings you here?
    585489|00000000||The totem! Right where it should be. Now's when we eat the herbs.
    585490|00000000||Why would we do that?
    585491|00000000||To go on - to where the nightmares are. So says the legend, and so we will do.
    585497|00000000||Fine, give 'em here.
    594719|00000000||Take it. Uve, Jorulf, eat up! To the last grain!
    585492|00000000||Fine, give them here.
    585493|00000000||What're these herbs?
    585496|00000000||What herbs are these?
    594714|00000000||Hmm, what'd that druid say? Hemlock, poppy, nightshade, and that chicky-- no, uh, henbane.
    594716|00000000||Whoa. In for one helluva ride.
    585500|00000000||I don't feel no different. How 'bout you, Uve?
    585501|00000000||Hah! You're askin' a mute his opinion. You're feelin' it, mate!
    594723|00000000||C'mon, let's go. Time to face our fears.
    437529|00000000||Can we talk? I'm…
   1016736|00000000||I know who you are, Geralt of Rivia. I'm Lugos. Madman's what many call me. Jarl of Clan Drummond's what I am.
   1016655|00000000||Two clans on one island… tough to be neighbors, so near each other?
   1016657|00000000||A neighbor is one who lives nearby, not one who stole half your home. The an Craite seized our lands.
   1016667|00000000||In the days of Harald the Cripple. That was three centuries ago.
   1016669|00000000||Doesn't change the fact they had no right. I'll rid Ard Skellig of Crach and his brood yet.
   1016651|00000000||Your relations with Crach - how are they?
   1016671|00000000||Just out of curiosity, why do they call you "Madman"?
   1016673|00000000||WAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!
   1016675|00000000||That's why.
   1016652|00000000||Why exactly do they call you "Madman"?
   1016746|00000000||Go see your friend Crach if you wanna talk.
    437533|00000000||Your son did well in the Cave of Dreams.
   1016738|00000000||Why even tell me this?
   1016740|00000000||Well, got reason to believe you underestimate him.
   1016742|00000000||What? Did he whine to you? Oh, the shame! When I see him I'll--
   1016744|00000000||He didn't say anything. It's just… well, it's plain obvious.
    437531|00000000||Your son did well in the Cave of Dreams.
   1016653|00000000||Farewell.
    437813|00000000||Well? What is it?
   1016748|00000000||Farewell, Lugos.
   1044223|00000000||It's true! And that storm were keepin' us from huntin' and raidin'! You drove it off! A reward's in order, to my mind.
   1041808|00000000||No need. Mage in the tower paid me.
   1041818|00000000||Thanks, but you need that coin a lot more than I do.
   1041820|00000000||Not enough that he's handy, he's noble, too!
   1041822|00000000||Ynga!
   1042511|00000000||What?
   1041824|00000000||Found a mage in the tower. He was just as eager to take it away from here. Rewarded me generously for my help.
   1041826|00000000||If that's so, we've naught left but to say our thanks.
   1044229|00000000||Didn't find anyone else inside.
   1044235|00000000||Didn't find any of your folk inside. Just a mage and some monsters.
   1044237|00000000||Hmm. Perhaps the tower transported 'em somewheres? Was magic, after all… Maybe Hurn's still alive?
   1044239|00000000||Let's go home, Njal, no point standin' here.
   1044241|00000000||Farewell, witcher. Thanks again for helpin'.
   1044231|00000000||I found your friends. All dead, unfortunately. Sorry.
   1044233|00000000||Told 'im not to go… but he wanted glory. Ahh.
   1044228|00000000||I found your friends. They're all dead.
   1044226|00000000||Wait, witcher! Did ye happen to see me brother in there? Hurn's his name. He went in with the druid and a few other lads.
   1041812|00000000||Aye, well if ye ever come through here again, stop in. Ye'll be welcomed with open arms.
   1041828|00000000||Thanks, farewell.
   1041810|00000000||Always knew An Skelligers were honest folk.
   1041807|00000000||Couldn't agree more.
   1042509|00000000||Now didn't I tell ye… 'twere a witcher we needed? Aye, can't do better than an expert. And expert work deserves a fittin' reward.
   1042499|00000000||You're alive?! And in one piece?!
   1042501|00000000||One soaking wet piece.
   1042503|00000000||Will you teach me to fly?
   1042505|00000000||Another time, maybe.
   1042507|00000000||Never seen such marvels in me life! Boom! Flash! Tower disappeared, and you was fallin' from the sky. And the storm? Gone in an instant.
    420952|7643aa11||Servant
   1055697|f38c55da||White Wolf
    523302|00000000||Folan! I was sure you'd died! Where've you been?
    523304|00000000||Cerys has gone to Spikeroog! Alone!
    523306|00000000||Couldn't wait, no, had to sneak off, as if you were afeared someone'd steal the giant out from under you!
    523308|00000000||Cerys? She staked a claim to the throne, then? And you'd 'ave rather gone with her?
    523310|00000000||I'd 'ave liked to have the choice!
    523292|00000000||Folan! Thought you'd died! What happened? Where'd you go?
    523294|00000000||What happened's that you mighta listened to me when I told you not to take Egnar! But you don't listen to anyone!
    523296|00000000||Know what he did? Stole the hornwall horn, put the whole crew at risk! I followed him…
    523298|00000000||Alone! Should've woke me. I'd 'ave listened to you then, but instead…
    523316|00000000||Wait!
    523377|00000000||Still need to thank you, Geralt of Rivia. I'll never forget you came to my aid.
    523380|00000000||Know me?
    523468|00000000||Your father sent me to find you.
    523504|00000000||I've the giant to defeat. Head home soon as I've done that. Gotta help Leif first.
    523506|00000000||Leif's dead.
    523378|00000000||Your father sent me to find you.
    523515|00000000||Where's the rest of your crew?
    523517|00000000||Good question.
    523535|00000000||Fought our way through a swarm of sirens to get here. Only a handful of us left after the battle on the lake.
    523553|00000000||Good thing you showed up when you did, 'cause Leif's wounds need tending. Those bitches tore him up good.
    523541|00000000||But I suppose that if all had gone smoothly, it woulda made for a dreadfully short ballad about our heroic adventure.
    523548|00000000||Seems more doomed than heroic to me.
    523555|00000000||No, that's just the gods lookin' to see what metal we're made of. They'll soon get their answer.
    523557|00000000||Ehh…
    523513|00000000||Where's the rest of your crew?
    523379|00000000||Know me?
    523393|00000000||You know me?
    523470|00000000||Our bards sing ballads about you. And my father told me of your adventures when I was a lad.
    523472|00000000||I remember it well - you needn't be a witcher to be a hero. Cold water and a salty breeze - those are a Skellige lad's potions!
    523484|00000000||So that ballad 'bout the witcher and the sorceress… that's you?
    523488|00000000||Yeah…
    523382|00000000||Where's the rest of your crew?
    523397|00000000||Where's the rest of your crew?
    523438|00000000||Fought our way through a swarm of sirens to get here. Only a handful of us left after that battle.
    523441|00000000||Now we're but three. The sirens tore Leif up good. We should see to his wounds.
    523444|00000000||He's dead.
    523446|00000000||What? Nah, he's just unconscious. Lost a bit of blood.
    523448|00000000||He's dead. Trust me.
    523451|00000000||Swore he'd sink his blade into the giant's heart - swore it on the bones of his ancestors.
    523454|00000000||Comin' with me?
    523456|00000000||Stupid question.
    523458|00000000||Join us, Geralt.
   1057848|00000000||Leif! Hold on!
   1057850|00000000||To me! Women and children! We've got to protect them!
    457920|3220d405||Mathios
    578886|00000000||Pounding's better with a partner.
    578889|00000000||Thanks, Jorund. Pounding's always better with a partner.
    578887|00000000||Relax, Jorund. It's just banter. Weak, but still.
    578888|00000000||Nay. We's serious. Dead serious.
    592553|00000000||And foolish as colts that graze on hemlock. But I'll put you straight.
    578883|00000000||Relax, Jorund.
    578879|00000000||Him again. Got a taste for Skellige mead, vagrant?
    578880|00000000||It's not bad, thanks.
    578881|00000000||Hah. Then get yourself a keg for the road - and fuck off.
    578882|00000000||I see you lads still don't understand the law o' hospitality. Tough, seems I gotsta pound it into you.
    163851|00000000||Wind blowin' in from the north, five foot waves… Our canvas torn to shreds, tiller had snapped in two…
    163853|00000000||Suddenly, a siren breaches the water's surface right before my eyes! Beautiful, fair-faced, teets rollin' like the surf in winter…
    163857|00000000||So, bam! I spring into action, wrap a line 'round her tail… And off she goes, draggin' the boat like an ox pullin' a cart! Then--
    163859|00000000||Bah! Them's bollocks you're talkin', Edvin.
    163861|00000000||What do you know 'bout the sea? You've spent your whole life tendin' sheep! And don't interrupt, there's some folk here wanna listen!
    163863|00000000||What about you, Leif. Ye famous for anythin'?
    163865|00000000||Me? Aye, for many things…
    163867|00000000||I'm all ears.
    163869|00000000||Well... eerrr... Recently…
    163871|00000000||Recently Leif got drunk and mistook his hut for an outhouse. And that's about all he's got to brag about.
   1049092|00000000||Must be prosperin' 'round here, eh? Heard there's silver in them hills.
   1049094|00000000||Aye, it's there. But tain't so easy to get it out.
   1049096|00000000||Why's that? Veins're too deep in the rock?
   1049098|00000000||Naye. There's somethin' in those caves… Somethin' that kills any man that enters, pickaxe in hand or no.
    491979|00000000||All right… In you go and get out of those rags!
    491980|00000000||All of them?
    491981|00000000||I should think so!
    491982|00000000||Go on... Mum's waitin' for us.
    491983|00000000||What's takin' you? Ye need help?
    491984|00000000||No. I'm almost ready.
    492296|00000000||Let's go… I'm gettin' goose pimples…
    497389|00000000||Wrap yourself in a towel? Well, whatever makes you comfortable…

    509976|00000000||The animals - they're alive! Yen, watch out!
    509973|00000000||Aaa…
    509974|00000000||Are you all right?
    509975|00000000||Cut myself. The door's locked.
    550908|00000000||Taree rah ree rah.
    550279|00000000||Heard one bloke demanded dragon heart fiber be fused into his blade… The twat.
    550342|00000000||Get to work, 'stead of flappin' your gob.
    550344|00000000||If the Black Ones block the ports on the Continent, who're we gonna raid?
    550346|00000000||Leave me be, lad.
    550876|00000000||Greetings! How's your health?
    550920|00000000||My regards!
    550922|00000000||Uhum?
    550924|00000000||Hangin' by, mate?
    550878|00000000||A billion barrels o' burnin' pitch!
    550926|00000000||Ooh-la-la. So much hardware he can barely walk.
    550910|00000000||Hey now!
    550859|00000000||So what? Should I pound it into a poker?

    166185|00000000||Tell me, Lugos, why're you sendin' your vermin to my isle?
    166187|00000000||That squealin' swine sounds uncannily like Donar. Too bad I don't talk to swine.
    171533|00000000||Not talkin' to you, shitbrains. I'm warnin' you.
    384885|00000000||Take this outside.
    384895|00000000||Settle this outside.
    434601|00000000||Who the fuck are you to advise me, eh?
    434603|00000000||Someone with better manners. You insult Bran's memory and Crach's hospitality with this.
   1056608|00000000||Move the benches! There's to be some gob slappin'!
    373155|00000000||Know what, Lugos? Just realized I don't give a damn about your hallowed rules of hospitality.
    373157|00000000||Finally! Some diversion! And here I was ready to puke from all the boredom.
    373159|00000000||Come on, freak. Show us what you're made of!
    373151|00000000||Gone too far, Lugos.
    373163|00000000||Calm down, Lugos.
    376216|00000000||No wench'll teach me how to fight.
    373165|00000000||That was not my intention.
    516251|00000000||Come, Geralt, I believe this discussion's run its course.
    373153|00000000||Let's calm down.
    384905|00000000||Emperor would be very pleased to hear you quarrel.
    434605|00000000||His Imperial Majesty is more than welcome to visit.
    434740|00000000||Let 'im sail over here. We ain't afeard o' the Black Ones.
    434607|00000000||Raiding coastal villages is one thing. Total war with the empire is another.
    516124|00000000||Awfully mouthy, this one. Go stir your cauldron and pierce some boils, witch. Don't talk when you haven't got a fuckin' clue.
    384887|00000000||Thought Skelligers called a truce for feasts.
    384889|00000000||I know the hallowed customs. But Lugos ought to know that I'll not let him raid my Hindarsfjall bare.
    384891|00000000||You don't scare anyone, Donar. I'll be by soon to plough your priestesses, drink from your tankard and shit on your table. Be sure to leave a candle lit for me.
    384883|00000000||Calm down.
    376171|00000000||Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Geralt, Jarl Donar an Hindar and Jarl Madman Lugos.
    384879|00000000||Callin' Lugos a madman's an insult to madmen. He's a common goatfucker.
    410228|00000000||Call me goatfucker one more time, and I'll chop off your head, stick it on a pike, and piss down your neckhole.
    434597|00000000||Enough. Time to settle this - here and now.
    434738|00000000||Oh, hahahah! Givin' me a true fright right now! Shat me best trousers! Put that away before you cut yourself, you cunt.
    373214|00000000||What do ya say to that, eh? Fat lot o' help they did you, them… mutations or what's it you call 'em. We Skelligers got our own ways. We live, eat, breathe, drink and fuck in the bracin' air of these isles. Strength follows naturally.
    376220|00000000||And wenches like strong lads, am I right?
    373216|00000000||What wenches don't like are boors. High time you learned that.
    373218|00000000||Your loss.
    420475|00000000||Drink like you fight, and we're in for a good time. To Bran!
    420463|00000000||Nothing wrong with having a drink in good company.
    420465|00000000||I remind you we've important matters to discuss later. Matters that require a clear mind.
    420467|00000000||I remember.
    420477|00000000||Geralt, I'd have nothing against you drinking yourself stupid if we had nothing important planned…
    420481|00000000||Yennefer and I'd be honored. Here's to your health!
    373304|00000000||Can't.
    373312|00000000||No hard feelings, but we'll have to drink another time.
    376224|00000000||Yes. We've important discussions ahead.
    373316|00000000||You land rats are all the same - afeard o' your wenches.
    420485|00000000||Forgive us. We should mingle, talk to some of the other guests.
    420479|00000000||To Jarl Madman Lugos and his madness!
    373306|00000000||Sure, I'll knock one back with you, Lugos.
    373302|00000000||Gladly.
    373236|00000000||Witcher, have a drink with me. Proof there's no hard feelings.
   1054984|00000000||And visit me atimes, I insist. Jorund's been jabberin' about bringin' in a witcher for that haunted lighthouse.
   1054986|00000000||Do me favor, meet 'im for an ale at the tavern near Arinbjorn. Then you've but a short jaunt to find me so's we can knock back somethin' stronger.
   1054989|00000000||Here's to our next!
    373208|00000000||Had enough?
    373210|00000000||Argh, aah, ye got me good. That were quite a wallop. Still seein' spots… Room' rockin' like a leaky tub in a hurricane.
    373212|00000000||We'll call it even, then, soon as you apologize to the lady.
    410268|00000000||Don't hold it against me, m'lady. It's my deep conviction sorceresses're needed, deeply so.
    410270|00000000||No offense taken. Forget about it.
    376218|00000000||That I like. And the knockin' - it's what men do. Gimme your paw, witcher, lemme squeeze. It's a worthy one.
    516471|00000000||Hehe. Thanks, White One. If not for you that mighta taken me much longer. And I need to see t' Leif.
    516488|00000000||The bitches nearly ripped his innards out. And we two are all that's left of my crew.
    516496|00000000||Oh, right. You might not've heard. I'm Hjalmar an Craite. And I'll never forget you helpin' me in a time o' need.
    516531|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    516532|00000000||The Geralt of Rivia? Like in the ballad about the sorceress and the witcher? You're still alive?
    516552|00000000||Looks like it.
    516553|00000000||Right, well, forgive me. Just thought that all happened long ago. My da used to tell me stories of your adventures.
    516559|00000000||So… what're you doin' on Undvik?
    516639|00000000||Lemme help you.
    516665|00000000||I can help.
    516673|00000000||Hm…
    516677|00000000||Agreed!
    516560|00000000||What happened to your crew?
    516554|00000000||Your father sent me.
    516616|00000000||Your father sent me. He needs you on Ard Skellig.
    516864|00000000||Impossible. Da knows I'll not return till I kill the giant.
    516869|00000000||Situation's changed. The fate of all Skellige will be decided on Ard Skellig. They're getting ready to choose a new king.
    516872|00000000||The fate of Skellige's bein' decided here. If I accomplish this deed, it'll mean the gods have chosen me to rule.
    516873|00000000||The other claimants are already waiting at Kaer Trolde.
    516985|00000000||Hm, seems I must hurry then. Time to face the giant. Comin' with?
    517065|00000000||We should see to your friend.
    517067|00000000||Right. His wounds need tendin'.
    517069|00000000||Not what I meant. He's dead.
    517008|00000000||Your friend needs help.
    517009|00000000||Let's go.
    517015|00000000||Take it you're gonna fight the giant whether I help you or not.
    517016|00000000||Of course. But first, I need to patch up Leif, move him where he won't be bothered.
    517040|00000000||Leif's dead.
    516701|00000000||What? Nah, he's just unconscious. Lost a bit of blood, you know?
    516713|00000000||He's dead. Trust me.
    516710|00000000||Swore he'd sink his blade into the giant's heart - swore it on the bones of his ancestors.
    516738|00000000||Let's go.
    517011|00000000||With my crew gone, I could use a body at my side. And poor Leif…
    517013|00000000||Leif's dead.
    516655|00000000||Not about to stop you.
    516657|00000000||Then perhaps you'd like to join me?
    516638|00000000||Won't get in your way.
    516636|00000000||Visiting the isle.
    516637|00000000||Very amusing, Geralt of Rivia.
    516654|00000000||Everyone knows a true brute's taken over Undvik - the Ice Giant, whom I've come here to defeat.
    516586|00000000||Visiting the isle.
    516587|00000000||What happened to your crew?
    516782|00000000||Your crew - what happened to them?
    516787|00000000||Ahh, it all started with a storm - you see, then came the blasted sirens. I had a hornwall horn to drive them off, but one night it just disappeared.
    516819|00000000||Next morn the giant ambushed us, crushed half my men. Hurled Arvid against the rocks, tucked Vigi under his arm…
    516799|00000000||Just four made it here. But I suppose if it had all gone smoothly, t' woulda made for a dreadfully short ballad about our heroic adventures.
    516800|00000000||Seems more doomed than heroic to me.
    516820|00000000||No, that's just the gods lookin' to see what mettle we're made of. They'll soon get their answer.
    516613|00000000||Geralt!
    516767|00000000||Farewell, an Craite.
   1073999|00000000||Gotta use my senses, find the one marked by the Woodland Spirit.
    372778|00000000||Oh, that's the one! Thanks for the rescue, stranger!
    372784|00000000||If not for you, we'd have been siren food! May you thrive and prosper!
    457899|003416c2||Olaf
   1084926|cf7152db||Armorer
    349800|00000000||I like the way you die!
    383030|00000000||Bout time… I'd 'ave sprouted roots if the ground weren't so damn hard.
    383032|00000000||I'll wait here.
    383034|00000000||I'll cover you. Position myself so as to keep the giant in sight.
    383439|00000000||Shut your trap! I sat in a bloody troll cauldron with nary a murmur.
    515184|00000000||I'll make sure that madman don't run at the giant all alone.
    515471|00000000||See you're rarin' to go.
    515472|00000000||Wonderful.
    515473|00000000||Ehh…
    524525|00000000||Sirens… Ploughin' sirens! If they'd just had that blasted horn…
    524527|00000000||Wait for you by the ship.
    524530|00000000||Thorsten…
    524531|00000000||Arvid an Tordarroch. He was dead set on comin' with us…
    524532|00000000||Was to be his last voyage…
    524533|00000000||Herrik Stormson. Didn't even know him well.
    587598|00000000||Looked away a moment… Turned back around, saw a bear standin' by the bench.
    587610|00000000||Tis the gods' doin'. Maybe they're punishin' us?
    587612|00000000||For what? You're talkin' rubbish.
    587582|00000000||So the tales are true… Warriors in battle frenzy transformed into wild beasts…
    587584|00000000||Berserkers… But how'd they come to be here?
    586307|00000000||Pull yourself together, Sinna. How'd they get in?
    586309|00000000||Dunno… The gates were shut!
    430781|00000000||Looking for Cerys, Jarl an Craite's daughter.
    430783|00000000||Dah! You've found her or near to! Lass was just here.
    382075|00000000||Know where she mighta gone?
    382065|00000000||Took an interest in our jarl, asked about his childhood. So I told her to see Bergthora and Eiric.
    382053|00000000||Looking for a young woman, name of Cerys.
    435296|00000000||Bless ya, and my blessings to Cerys when you see her.
    435294|00000000||Take care.
    382057|00000000||Take care.
    382067|00000000||Who are Bergthora and Eiric?
    382071|00000000||Who're Bergthora and Eiric?
    382073|00000000||Years ago, Eiric was close with the old jarl. Was the jarl that helped him win Bergthora's hand. They live towards the east end of the village.
    347487|00000000||Greetings.
    347489|00000000||Hah, nary a soul for months. Then one day guests from afar start droppin' like rain in springtime.
    430779|00000000||You weary, traveler? Hungry?
   1024623|00000000||When do you go?
   1024625|00000000||Next new moon.
   1024626|00000000||I'd rather you stayed.
   1024628|00000000||Ye daft, woman? What would I say to me mates?
   1024630|00000000||Maybe that your wife's with child…?
    393502|00000000||Who are ye? Why're ye here?
    393504|00000000||Could ask you the same. Places like this - usually home to necrophages alone.
   1048541|00000000||There're corpse-eaters, aye. And they grow bolder by the day, crawl out to attack the livin'!
    393506|00000000||We'll kill 'em all! Clear the mine with our swords in our hands! Honor our fathers in doin' so.
   1047084|00000000||I'm a witcher. Could go with you and help.
   1047086|00000000||And steal the glory due us?! No chance!
   1047082|00000000||Glory won't do much for you if ghouls're gnawing on your bones.
   1046105|00000000||Hm… when ye think on it… makes sense.
   1046109|00000000||Hmm… All right. You lead the way, then.
    393496|00000000||Could help you.
   1046127|00000000||If you're looking to die, that's your problem. So long.
    393498|00000000||Lemme get out of your way.
   1046123|00000000||Still here?
   1046125|00000000||Ye back? Come to see how we unburden the world o' ghouls?
    491800|00000000||Grass has grown over our loved ones graves - but their memory lives on.
    491802|00000000||We entrust them to the goddess.
    491899|00000000||Leif, son of Erik…
    491803|00000000||Perished in glory…
    491902|00000000||Kjall, son of Olaf…
    491904|00000000||Perished in glory…
    346059|00000000||Ventured a bit too far, white-haired stray. But ye still got a chance to leave 'ere alive… if ye pay.
   1050595|00000000||Willing to leave, not willing to pay.
   1050597|00000000||Fine, I'll leave. Not about to pay anyone for the privilege, though.
   1050599|00000000||Course. We're not bloody traders, not gonna haggle.
    346065|00000000||I don't have time to argue with all of you. Here, take it and forget you ever saw me.
    346061|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
    346067|00000000||Let's leave my coin pouch out of it.
    449499|00000000||We'll take it anyway - just after we gut ye!
    346063|00000000||No chance.
    507987|00000000||So? No one else dares face me?
    511869|00000000||Is there truly no warrior in all Skellige who can defeat me?
    507988|00000000||Wench is mad! She near killed 'im! Svern, can you hear me?
    507989|00000000||I hear ye, it'th jutht-- Ptooey!
    511883|00000000||Heheheh… Lotht me tooth.
   1023214|00000000||Well, come now, out with it. How else might I help you?
   1023216|00000000||So… See, thing is… Somethin's off, of late. I'm not on form. Havin' trouble with… ye know, uh…
   1023218|00000000||Aaah. I understand. You must make a brew of lovage. One hour before, you know, this, that, the other.
   1055110|231374e3||Skelliger
    346241|fd7deb62||Adventurer
   1041758|00000000||Commencing annihilation.
   1041762|00000000||Collection compromised. Commencing beast teleportation.
   1041756|00000000||Intruder in library. Collection integrity compromised.
    567560|00000000||Air's thick with incense.
    567561|00000000||I'm gonna puke. It's as though--
    584211|00000000||Shh. Hear that?
    584213|00000000||Noise from below.
    584215|00000000||Ah, finally.
    347481|0016d46a||Lumberjack
   1086456|e9d17e28||Brokvar Shieldmaiden
    313590|acc55a20||Bandit
    421638|00000000||Farewell.
    421634|00000000||Farewell.
    421632|00000000||What're you offering?
    421636|00000000||I'd like to look at your choice of swords.
    421630|00000000||Greetings, stranger.
   1070578|00000000||You earned this.
   1070580|00000000||Didn't I, now? Though truth be told, I'd rather 'ave beat a bugger like Blueboy Lugos. But fuck it - a win's a win. Thanks, mate.
   1070581|00000000||Gonna take on Nilfgaard now?
   1070584|00000000||What now? Call up the crews, hit Nilfgaard?
   1070589|00000000||We go back to the Black Ones now. Come out of the sea at them, we'll grind them to dust. Any who remain'll limp fast as they can back to their bloody south.
   1070582|00000000||Farewell.
   1070594|00000000||Take care, Hjalmar.
   1070610|00000000||Farewell.
   1070609|00000000||Oughta be proud of her.
   1070612|00000000||Not even a little proud of her? Come on, admit it.
   1070614|00000000||A bit, aye, She is the blood of me blood, bone of me bone. But don't tell her I said so. Liable to puff out her chest - which'd do her good, now I think of it.
   1070616|00000000||We showed Lugos - that's most important. D'you see that rage grip 'im? I thought he'd burst!
   1070618|00000000||Yeah. Surprised to see him in that much of a huff, actually.
   1070622|00000000||Our clans've been buttin' heads, chests, bellies forever. It's the lay o' the land.
   1070600|00000000||You all right?
   1070602|00000000||So so… Any way you cut it, I was bested by a wench.
   1070604|00000000||Not just any wench.
   1070606|00000000||Aye, true. Suppose if it had to be so, I'm glad it was Cerys.
    560460|00000000||We must find the traitors quickly. Elsewise the warriors will take matters into their own hands. Castle's abuzz already.
    560461|00000000||Think they'd attack Crach openly?
    560462|00000000||My father or each other. All in the finest Skellige tradition. Haven't had a good civil war in ages.
   1072692|00000000||C'mon already.
   1086460|11956711||Heymaey Shieldmaiden
   1006209|00000000||Why're you even interested? Djinns are dangerous sometimes, and malicious all the time.
   1006210|00000000||I remember. But the advantages outweigh the risks. If I can tame a djinn, I shall gain incredible power. And that could be useful to us one of these days.
   1006195|00000000||Why are you even interested?
   1006518|00000000||You sure this mage actually had a djinn?
   1006542|00000000||His books strongly suggest he did. He describes taming one, harnessing energy from its power.
   1006501|00000000||Know for a fact this mage had a djinn?
   1006500|00000000||Know where to look?
   1006252|00000000||Know where to look - for the mage and the djinn?
   1006491|00000000||The locals say they last saw Amos' ship off the coast of Hindarsfjall. Just before a once-in-an-eon storm broke.
   1006493|00000000||Doubt we'll find them, then. Mage is probably fish food, and the djinn escaped.
   1006495|00000000||Not necessarily. But even if it is so, I'll not give up without seeing some evidence. Will you help me?
   1006516|00000000||Since you put it that way… fine, I'll help you.
   1006517|00000000||Thank you. A boat awaits in the harbor. Come.
   1006511|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
   1010366|00000000||I'm gonna follow some other leads. Something to finally put us on Ciri's trail - that's what we need.
   1010368|00000000||Good luck.
   1010370|00000000||I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from him, then ride for Kaer Morhen.
   1010372|00000000||I shall join you as soon as I can.
   1007992|00000000||Sorry, Yen. If you wanna go djinn hunting, I'm afraid you're on your own.
   1007994|00000000||The most I can hope to accomplish on my own are a few chats with angry Skelligers.
   1007998|00000000||If that's how you wish to be, I shall travel to Vizima. Emperor must be wondering what progress we've made…
   1008000|00000000||Do what you gotta do.
   1006512|00000000||Not about to help you with this.
   1006514|00000000||I've no gold to offer in reward… but I shall be ever so grateful.
   1006497|00000000||All right. So what exactly do you expect me to do?
   1006499|00000000||You must help me find this djinn.
   1006488|00000000||What do you want from me?
   1006216|00000000||Why do you want a djinn?
   1006217|00000000||How do you know he had a djinn?
   1006543|00000000||Storm wouldn't pose a threat if he'd had a djinn. He could just utter a wish.
   1006544|00000000||Perhaps he had none left. Or something unexpected happened…
   1006197|00000000||They know what happened to him?
   1006199|00000000||The locals say they last saw his ship off the coast of Hindarsfjall. Then a once-in-an-eon storm broke.
   1006201|00000000||So he's probably fish food by now.
   1006203|00000000||Not necessarily. I must learn what became of him.
   1006205|00000000||Why? D'you know him?
   1006207|00000000||No. It's not the mage who interests me - it's his djinn.
   1006194|00000000||What happened to him?
    580389|00000000||Always did know how to win friends.
    580390|00000000||I was provoked.
    580391|00000000||Mhm, saw it happen. Wanted to talk to me about something?
    580392|00000000||Amos var Ypsis, a specialist on djinns - heard of him? I found a tome he'd penned in the emperor's library. Var Ypsis set off for Skellige one day and was never heard from again.
   1006193|00000000||I asked some of the local folk. Some here still remember him.
    491853|00000000||Arike… Storm's comin', take the wash down.
    491855|00000000||I can see that. Might be old, but I'm not blind yet…
    491856|00000000||Hey, now… what's this about bein' 'old'…?
    491857|00000000||It's a fact, I'm old. As are you. Come sit with me…
    497735|00000000||And the storm?
    497737|00000000||We've time.
   1022226|00000000||So what can I cut for ye, Joris? Ye want loin? Maybe some shoulder?
   1022228|00000000||Nothin', rather… Seems to me this meat's got worms.
   1022230|00000000||Worms! Worms on your brain, them's the only worms here! Don't like me meat, go chew some grass.
    393560|00000000||Not interested.
    393582|00000000||Not interested.
    452077|00000000||They all say that. At first.
    452079|00000000||Well, this time there'll be no "second."
    393566|00000000||Hm, you're as lovely as…
    393568|00000000||As what? As what?
    393574|00000000||As rotten meat. And you're a monster. And I kill monsters.
    393556|00000000||You're as beautiful as…
    347676|00000000||Oh, a sweetheart! Fresh and scrumptious!
    393558|00000000||Tell me a rhyme. Then you'll get a prize. Or a beating.
    491192|00000000||Heard you're a man with troubles…
    491128|00000000||Something troubling you?
    491218|00000000||I'm sorry… Farewell.
    505242|00000000||Farewell.
    491197|00000000||Sorry. Farewell.
    491091|00000000||Farewell.
    491090|00000000||Heard you're having trouble with a curse?
    491129|00000000||Hear you're having trouble with a curse?
    505234|00000000||Aye, I am. Look, see it lyin' there, the horse head on the pole? That's--
    505236|00000000||A Nithing. Kind of curse. Seen this before. They're nothing to scoff at - can bring misfortune, even death.
    505238|00000000||Aye! And the name carved upon it is Tjalve, my first-born. Boy's feverish, grows weaker by the day. I fear I'll bury 'im before the next moon. Tried to lift the curse myself but… no luck.
    491196|00000000||I can help you.
    491215|00000000||I can help you - one of two ways.
    505251|00000000||First - I can try to convince whoever put up the Nithing to lift the curse themselves. Second - I can deflect the curse back on whoever cast it by writing their name on the shaft. Either way, need to know who's behind this.
    505278|00000000||But… I don't trouble no one. Don't know a soul who'd wish it upon me.
    505280|00000000||Mhm. Guess I gotta investigate…
    505241|00000000||I can help you.
    491088|00000000||Mind if I interrupt?
    491089|00000000||Nay. My prayers're in vain anyways…
   1063474|00000000||Heard Cerys dropped in for a visit…
   1063476|00000000||Aye, 'tis an honor to host an Craite's daughter.
   1063478|00000000||She come for a reason? Or just to visit?
   1063480|00000000||I dunno. Must have a matter to tend to…
   1063482|00000000||Mean you didn't ask her?
   1063484|00000000||Eeee, I'm not one to pull folk by their tongue. If they don't wanna talk, they shouldn't…
   1063672|00000000||Ah, Yorg, you're useless…
    490884|00000000||Freya, have mercy… Who'll I leave my home to if Tjalve dies? Who'll continue my line?
   1049191|00000000||Ye hear a dragon's made its nest beyond the village?
   1049193|00000000||A dragon? Beh. The drivel of old wenches.
   1049195|00000000||So who killed Askel and Nilas? Will ye say it was the old wenches, too?
   1049197|00000000||What're ye sayin'?! I saw 'em at market no more'n a week past…
   1049199|00000000||Wouldn't recognize 'em if ye saw 'em now - not after what the dragon did.
   1023288|00000000||Send us good health.
   1023290|00000000||And plenty o' fish to fill our nets.
   1023292|00000000||And a sea monster to swallow that whoreson Ornolf.
   1025034|00000000||Ye deaf? Pour the mead.
   1025036|00000000||You've had enough. Go home.
   1025038|00000000||Who the fuck're you to tell me what to do, eh? Jarls make you king when I went out to piss?!
   1025040|00000000||I don't rule the isles, but I do rule this tavern. So calm down or I'll toss ye out mug first.
    167916|00000000||Help! Over here!
    171430|00000000||Watch out! They're attackin'!
    166754|68667754||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    518264|00000000||Someone oughta sail after her, stop this foolishness…
    518266|00000000||She's back already. What's more, she was successful.
    518268|00000000||Oh…
    518270|00000000||She's always liked competin' with me. I've always won in the end so far, though.
    518271|00000000||Well, time I was on me way. So long, Geralt. And thanks for your help.
    518276|00000000||So long, an Craite.
    518255|00000000||Set out to help Udalryk. Don't think she can do it?
    518257|00000000||Oh, gods, Cerys…
    518259|00000000||Uh, witcher - you wouldn't happen to be headin' to Spikeroog by chance?
    518213|00000000||She sailed off to Spikeroog. Alone.
    518253|00000000||Alone? What on earth was she thinking?
    518216|00000000||She sailed off for Spikeroog.
    518217|00000000||Surprised everyone.
    518219|00000000||Surprised everyone.
    518221|00000000||And da? Did he support her? Let her set off on some mad expedition?
    518245|00000000||Wasn't pleased. Especially since Cerys didn't mention it to him beforehand.
    518247|00000000||Nor to me.
    518177|00000000||Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, won back Undvik… and lost my entire crew.
    518191|00000000||Who else has put forth a claim? Blueboy Lugos, surely, and Otrygg, Svanrige…
    518193|00000000||And Cerys.
    518195|00000000||Cerys? Me sis? But she's…
    518323|00000000||Farewell, an Craite.
    518325|00000000||Thanks for your help, witcher. I've a distinct sensation, won't say where, that we'll meet again.
    518307|00000000||Farewell.
    518306|00000000||Think everyone'll see it that way?
    518309|00000000||Think everyone'll see it that way?
    518319|00000000||I'm prepared to take responsibility for their deaths. I was in charge of the expedition.
    518351|00000000||And they all believed in me, laid their trust in me.
    518179|00000000||Aye. Need to make it known, tell all how bravely my boys fought. Make their families proud.
    518300|00000000||A great many true warriors perished, but victory was ours. The folk of Undvik can go home.
    517988|00000000||Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
    518022|00000000||Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
    518024|00000000||Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, won back Undvik… and lost my entire crew.
    518038|00000000||Mayhaps should've set out alone - like Cerys.
    518164|00000000||Regret ever setting out on this expedition?
    518166|00000000||What's that matter now? Giant's dead. And the folk of Undvik can go home.
    518039|00000000||Regret ever setting out?
    518040|00000000||Everyone'll call it a great victory.
    518042|00000000||Islanders will see it as a great victory.
    518043|00000000||Cause Skellige is the victor, whereas I've lost me friends. I've them to thank for makin' me a leader. They believed in me.
    518082|00000000||And Cerys… she back yet?
    518095|00000000||Yes and she did what she set out to do on Spikeroog.
    518154|00000000||She's always liked competin' with me.
    518156|00000000||Except so far I've always won.
    518161|00000000||Well, time I was on my way. So long, Geralt. Thanks for your help.
    518163|00000000||So long, an Craite.
    518090|00000000||Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
    518113|00000000||Went to Spikeroog, you say… Venture she aims to face whatever's slowly killin' Udalryk.
    518114|00000000||Some say Udalryk's the gods' chosen one.
    518120|00000000||They also say the gods are merciful. Witcher, uh, I'm sure Cerys would be glad to see me, but…
    523657|00000000||You wouldn't happen to be headin' to Spikeroog?
    518131|00000000||Don't know yet.
    523667|00000000||Your father asked me to, but… what if I help her, and she wins, and they crown her queen of Skellige?
    518132|00000000||Hahah! Hahaha! You helped me, too. Let's call it evenin' the odds, and leave the rest for the gods to decide.
    518134|00000000||Thought you didn't fully trust them.
    523692|00000000||Willin' to give them one last chance. So long, witcher.
    523694|00000000||Mm. So long, an Craite.
    518122|00000000||Don't know yet.
    518137|00000000||Probably not.
    518139|00000000||Probably? So you may still change your mind? If you happen to be sailin' that way, perhaps you'd…
    518141|00000000||Of course.
    518123|00000000||No.
    518121|00000000||Yes.
    518125|00000000||Yeah, I planned to go there.
    518127|00000000||Good.
    518142|00000000||Thanks, Geralt.
    518148|00000000||I hope we meet again.
    518144|00000000||Farewell, an Craite.
    485066|00000000||What about your family?
    485072|00000000||You should stay, see to Astrid, your mum…
    485074|00000000||Afterwards… Once I'm sure you'll make it. Let's go!
    485068|00000000||I don't know how to thank you…
    485070|00000000||You can thank me once we get there safe… Let's ride!
    485065|00000000||Thanks, Skjall.
    478895|00000000||What… What was that?!
    485022|00000000||The Wild Hunt.
    497857|00000000||Ragh nar Roog… The world's end…
    485025|00000000||No… Not yet… But I must go. They're here for me.
    485030|00000000||Get on the horse. I'll show you the way to the Rock.
   1033700|00000000||Greetings. Impressive tavern.
   1033702|00000000||Tavern?! 'T'ain't no tavern! 'Tis the House of Warriors!
   1033703|00000000||Mhm. So what do folk do in the House of Warriors? Fight?
   1033704|00000000||Atimes one'll take the other and give 'im a good slappin', aye. But mostly folk come 'ere to drink, eat, warm their bones by the fire, chatter a bit, maybe listen to a skald bay to the moon.
   1033705|00000000||About what folk do at a tavern.
   1033706|00000000||*Sighs* Argh, ye Continentals don't understand a thing. Ye need some of our mead - brewed wisdom, it is!
   1028773|00000000||Yearning to play a few rounds of gwent. That oughta set me straight.
   1086469|00000000||Really like to play gwent.
   1033710|00000000||Farewell.
   1033696|00000000||Farewell.
   1033694|00000000||Lemme see what you got on offer.
   1033708|00000000||What're you peddling? Lemme have a look.
   1033707|00000000||Yeah? What can I get ye?
    382824|00000000||Won't get away this time...
    578785|00000000||What're you doing here, then?
    578790|00000000||Why're you here, then? Don't look like warriors to me. More like shepherds.
    578791|00000000||Every Skelliger's a warrior. Even him born in a sheep shack.
    592517|00000000||But we don't expect you to understand. Every man's a thrall on the Continent, cringin' afore his master like a mongrel whinin' for scraps 'neath the table.
    578816|00000000||Didn't need any help.
    578855|00000000||Didn't need any help.
    578856|00000000||Anyone with half an eye and an ounce o' sense could see that. Was savin' them, not you.
    592530|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
    592533|00000000||Jorund, son of Sigvald. If you've no one to drink with, sit down with me. Share some mead and a tale.
    578817|00000000||You don't mind the occasional traveler?
    578818|00000000||I mind fools. No matter where they're from.
    578815|00000000||You not bothered by travelers?
    578805|00000000||Don't you talk to me about me da, Jorund, or I'll tuck you in 'neath a barrow.
    578806|00000000||And you remember this, stranger - this here's not Kaer Trolde, and we's not an Craite. Guests are not welcome.
    592522|00000000||Whosoever denies shelter to a traveler disgraces himself and brings shame on his clan. Your das teach you nothin'?
    578786|00000000||Not looking for trouble.
    578787|00000000||Ha. Look at 'im! Raise your voice and his tail slinks between his legs. Like a dog who's heard a wolf howl at the moon.
    578788|00000000||Lookin' to eat? Wait out in the yard, then, till Ilge tosses what's left in our bowls o'er the fence.
    578784|00000000||Not looking for trouble.
    592506|00000000||Look what the sea hurled ashore… Hey, you! What clan you from?
    592508|00000000||No clan. I'm from the Continent.
    592510|00000000||Skellige warriors alone drink in this tavern.
    585615|00000000||This a secret passage?
    561376|00000000||One rarely used, more like. When Hjalmar and I were little, we'd play here. Once--
    588399|00000000||Argh, bygone days.
    560505|00000000||There's another exit behind the barrels! But they're too heavy, we'll never move them!
    560506|00000000||Don't intend to.
    465434|00000000||Quick!
   1071076|00000000||Follow me, Geralt!
   1073349|00000000||Leave that! We must flee this place!
   1070368|00000000||Gods… We might've been burned alive!
   1070370|00000000||Somebody's damn desperate to bring our investigation to a quick end.
    410566|00000000||Shit…!
    560508|00000000||The spirit!
   1070366|00000000||What the--?
    456870|00000000||Hm, bard ran off. Can't say I blame him…
   1023400|00000000||Warriors from Rannveig came by night. They weilded swords for the menfolk, carried fetters for the women.
   1023402|00000000||But the Woodland Spirit protected us. We hid in the forest, waited in silence, quiet as can be.
   1023404|00000000||They came, burst into our huts… and found them empty. But before they realized it was a trap, we loosed our flaming arrows.
   1023406|00000000||What happened then?
   1023408|00000000||Screams. Blood. The stench of burnin' flesh… Don't frown, child. You too'll be killin' before long.
    523543|00000000||Fightin's is our sacred tradition!
    523544|00000000||The blood spilt in this arena bears witness to the clan's strength!
    523545|00000000||The victor today will be champion!
    546125|00000000||Yet any who is bold enough to fight is already a hero.
    524064|00000000||Shit.
    393578|00000000||We spoke… just recently…
    393580|00000000||They slew her… They killed Hilde.
    393614|00000000||Why? Why would they do it?
   1028784|00000000||Can't live on fish alone. Care for a round of cards?
   1028783|00000000||Care for a round of cards?
    421236|00000000||So long, and good luck out there.
    421228|00000000||Farewell.
    421226|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
    421234|00000000||Fresh? Hm.
    421232|00000000||Fresh fish?
    480921|00000000||No offense, but in that undergrowth and mud, you'd be like a…
    480923|00000000||Ball and chain?
    480925|00000000||Planned to say it gentler, but yeah, that's basically what I had in mind.
    491937|00000000||Fine… We'll do as you say. If the need arises, I can cast spells from up here.
    480927|00000000||Expected you to object…
    497029|00000000||Thought you might object…
    497031|00000000||Me? Please. I can be extraordinarily conciliatory.
    480971|00000000||Yen, look me in the eye… What're you plotting?
    480973|00000000||Many things… How to seize the Temerian crown, how to sell Kaer Morhen out from under you. Go, already.
    480965|00000000||Fine… See you later then.
    481049|00000000||Don't get hurt. Remember, I need you if I'm to find Ciri.
    481053|00000000||Oh, come on, I was just teasing. Fool. I need you - period. Better?
    481055|00000000||Mhm. Better.
    480926|00000000||See you later.
    478808|00000000||You can't help me track him… So I don't see any reason for you to go down there.
    491935|00000000||You're right… Besides, trudging through mud in these heels would be murder.
    480897|00000000||Craven was here. Look… the impression - kneeled down on one knee… And cut himself to make the offering. Bloodstains… see them?
    480899|00000000||No… I may be inhumanly beautiful, but I don't have superhuman senses. Not like you.
    478807|00000000||Which is why you should stay up here.
   1055413|f7a0c879||Nekker Warrior
   1015726|00000000||Surfaced for air - and they nabbed him.
   1015730|00000000||Shit… Old man warned me not to surface before the end. No wonder.
   1015732|00000000||Rats. Real pleasant place…
   1025567|00000000||Need to talk to you.
   1025568|00000000||Leave me be.
   1061175|00000000||Thank you. Take any coin I can get. Doesn't come often in my profession.
   1061172|00000000||Thanks. I can use it.
   1061177|00000000||Thank you, but… I won't accept any coin from you.
   1061179|00000000||Why do ye offend me so?
   1061181|00000000||Don't take it the wrong way. There're things even a witcher shouldn't take coin for.
   1061173|00000000||Don't want any payment.
   1042430|00000000||Your betrothed is dead. An ekhidna captured and killed him.
   1047701|00000000||Nils…
   1047703|00000000||This won't bring him back, I know, but I avenged him, killed the beast.
   1042432|00000000||Thank you. Knew all along he was true to me. And so I'll vow to be true to him for the rest of me days.
   1042434|00000000||Take this gold. 'Tain't much, but I want ye to take it.
   1042423|00000000||I know what happened to your betrothed.
   1025586|00000000||Did you see Nils die?
   1025587|00000000||I… I saw a shadow… Great wings, like a cloud passin' o'er the sky. Then I heard him scream.
   1025590|00000000||Somethin' grabbed 'im, lifted 'im up, then flew off towards the caves on the shore. But he was alive! Screamin' my name…
   1028277|00000000||I'll look into it.
   1025563|00000000||Did you see Nils die?
   1025564|00000000||Take care.
   1025588|00000000||Take care.
   1042424|00000000||Farewell.
   1025481|00000000||The gods take pity on me, for folk no longer listen…
   1042418|00000000||My Nils is dead… But he died a death befittin' a warrior. No one'll say again that he was untrue to me.
    349513|00000000||Oi, witcher! Got an offer for ye!
    392262|00000000||The leshen accepted my offering.
    392264|00000000||I saw the smoke rise and crows dance in the sky. Everything will return to the old ways.
    392266|00000000||You'll see in a few days. I've done my part.
    392268|00000000||Expecting coin, eh? Don't fret, I've got your gold.
    392270|00000000||Take it. You've earned every last bit.
    392280|00000000||Take care.
    392282|00000000||On your way, killer.
    392274|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    392272|00000000||You really want to live in the shadow of a monster?
    392276|00000000||You do know young boys will continue to die at the Covenant Stone, trying to become hunters. The killing'll never end.
    392278|00000000||I've not paid you to lecture me. You've done your job. It's time you left.
    392286|00000000||Well, well, Harald. Paying the witcher behind our backs to sod off and let the monster live.
    394367|00000000||We finished off the other elders. Just one left.
    392290|00000000||Pffft. Death's but another stage in the cycle. I embrace it.
    392292|00000000||Begone, witcher. And you can keep your coin.
    392298|00000000||Think murder will change something?
    392300|00000000||You've done your part, got your coin, what are you waitin' for?! No monsters left around here.
    392302|00000000||I won't let you kill him.
    392304|00000000||The witcher first! Get him!
    392294|00000000||Can't let you kill him.
    392296|00000000||This is none of my business.
    392306|00000000||You deserve each other.
    392308|00000000||Heh, you're one to judge.
    392310|00000000||Know your place, witcher. You've dealt with the beast. Time you were on your way.
    392312|00000000||Nothing will change, no matter what you do here.
    392314|00000000||We'll find out for ourselves. You see, it's our fate on the line here. You? You're just passing through.
   1024570|00000000||Maybe Lars'll bring some hare hides back from the hunt… I could make me some muffs.
   1024572|00000000||And I could use a fox pelt on me collar. What about you, Solve? What do you want from your man?
   1024574|00000000||I want 'im to take me huntin', 'stead of leavin' me to mind these pots. I'm a better shot than he is!
    348006|00000000||What was that?
    348519|00000000||Hmm… A magic explosion of some sort. So powerful even that echo was dangerous. I wager it destroyed the forest.
    498787|00000000||But Ciri and her companion weren't harmed… I saw them escape.
    498790|00000000||Let's see where to.
    576540|00000000||I was born ready. Let's start this.
    576546|00000000||Careful. It's a great honor… and a great danger.
    576548|00000000||The time has come for the Great Race! Riding for glory of Freya will be Geralt of Rivia and last year's champion, Astrid the Vipress!
    576537|00000000||I'm ready. Let's start.
    576539|00000000||Not just yet. But I'll be back. Soon.
    576538|00000000||Not yet.
    576534|00000000||To be perfectly honest, I did not think you would win even one race. Yet here you've gone and won three! Well, you've earned the right to ride in the Great Race… but do you think you are ready for it?
    457308|00000000||The traitor, witcher. You've got to find him. Before Skellige drowns in blood.
    588002|00000000||More drinkin', less gabbin'!
   1015746|00000000||Poor Katje…
   1015747|00000000||Oh the shame…
   1015748|00000000||I've known Bjorn so many years. To think he'd fail the Trial of the Path. I never expected that.
   1015749|00000000||Bjorn's honorable - to the point of madness. He'll not want to live in shame… I'm afeared he'll kill himself.
   1068972|00000000||Sacrificed me best mare… 'Twas an honor.
   1068974|00000000||She were good and true here, she'll be so beyond…
   1068976|00000000||May she serve our king worthily. One day we'll meet again.
   1069248|00000000||As we'll all meet King Bran. And feast at his table. And sing his praise.
   1068950|00000000||We've hewn the post.
   1069244|00000000||Time for the chiselers.
   1068955|00000000||Bust's gotta be worthy of a konung.
   1068937|00000000||Come on, trim it. It's got to be ready in time for the funeral, or Crach'll send us away with Bran.
   1068939|00000000||I'm tryin'! I do wonder where they'll put it up.
   1068941|00000000||On the shore at Larvik. His fierce gaze to protect us from the Black Ones!
   1069000|00000000||Let's drink to Bran of Clan Tuirseach!
   1069002|00000000||Let's drink to Clan an Craite, that's taken on the burden of this farewell!
   1068993|00000000||Bran of Clan Tuirseach! Our valiant king! Great is our loss!
   1068995|00000000||All must see the change your demise has wrought!
   1069267|00000000||We offer you our manes - the symbol of our valor, as you were the valor of the Isles.
   1068997|00000000||Our skulls shall be bare till a new king sits upon Skellige's throne.
   1069295|00000000||So what've you brought for the farewell feast?
   1069943|00000000||Bread… Sheep's milk cheese…
   1069297|00000000||Our wagon's full of loot we ripped from the Black Ones.
   1069299|00000000||We've also wine from temples of Melitele, remote ones.
   1069301|00000000||Wonder what'll please Bran more - your victuals or our war booty…
   1068980|00000000||Bran, our king! Take this mount we offer in sacrifice!
   1068982|00000000||May she serve you well, there beyond, where you've gone!
   1069265|00000000||Ride, ride, your deeds be many and glorious!
   1069317|00000000||On my mark…!
   1069319|00000000||Blooooooow!
   1069314|00000000||Let us pay homage to Bran of Clan Tuirseach. May our horns echo 'midst the cliffs and peaks!
    491778|00000000||Want you to lift the curse. I mean it.
    491781|00000000||Fine, I'll do it, but I've my terms. Lothar's to renounce his son and come back to me.
    491782|00000000||I'll be sure to tell him… But I think we both know what his answer'll be.
    491771|00000000||Want you to lift the curse.
    491773|00000000||You'd kill a child out of jealousy?
    491776|00000000||You'd kill a child out of jealousy? Are you serious?
    491777|00000000||Tis not jealousy but dignity that matters here. Ten years we lived side by side. Ten years! I cooked for 'im, washed his breeches, shared me bed… And he abandoned me with nary a word!
    505405|00000000||Whole village laughed… "Stupid bint Jonna, let herself be had!" Oh no - I've not been had, nor have I forgot.
   1077839|00000000||Found your shawl.
    491765|00000000||Found your shawl, near Lothar's house… by the Nithing you put up there.
    491766|00000000||How did you know?
    491767|00000000||Had a hunch… thanks for confirming it. You know Tjalve's got one foot in the grave?
    491768|00000000||Good. That bastard should never have been born.
    491770|00000000||Me, I was to be Lothar's bride! But he cast me aside for that flounder. Gettin' his comeuppance, now. Him and that whole ploughin' family.
    491756|00000000||Found your shawl.
    491758|00000000||Never mind. Farewell.
    491757|00000000||So long.
    491755|00000000||What do you want?
    180880|045b44bc||Clan Tuirseach Guard
   1028757|00000000||Dunno that I'm gonna buy anything, but I sure wouldn't mind a few rounds of gwent.
   1086478|00000000||I am one to play cards, though.
    421390|00000000||So long.
    421380|00000000||Farewell.
    421378|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421388|00000000||Show me what you got and we'll see.
    421384|00000000||Ah, damn the dogs, you don't look like one to haggle.
   1055672|9a0a0bba||Venomous Arachas
    587214|00000000||Wraaagghhh!
    587215|00000000||Ggggraaaghhhh!
    587213|00000000||Auuugggrrrr!
   1024668|00000000||So much time with the sun beatin' down all the while… yet icicles still hang from the roof. With not a thought o' meltin'.
   1024670|00000000||I'll knock 'em off. Gimme that broom.
   1024672|00000000||No, Trygvi! Best not to touch 'em. Who knows what could happen… We've had misfortune enough.
    301491|1c2e1012||Forktail
   1000390|00000000||How's it feel to rule? Jarls giving you any trouble?
   1000417|00000000||They're all very understandin', they seem to believe in me. Besides Lugos, o' course.
   1000420|00000000||Tried talking to him? Could still win him over…
   1000422|00000000||I don't know about that. He's more mule-headed than my father. But I'll try, o' course.
   1000075|00000000||How does it feel to rule Skellige?
   1000425|00000000||How's Hjalmar feeling in his new role? Hope it hasn't gone to his head.
   1000434|00000000||No, da's been keepin' my dear brother's feet on the ground.
   1000447|00000000||Yeah? So no war with Nilfgaard?
   1000449|00000000||That's unavoidable, I'm afraid. It's not just Hjalmar - everyone wants it.
   1000451|00000000||Everyone… except you.
   1000453|00000000||War's death and destruction, even if it's in defense. Yes, I'd rather avoid it if there were a way.
   1000455|00000000||But… folk say the Black Ones will attack sooner or later. When they do, I'm glad Hjalmar will lead us into battle.
   1000395|00000000||Hjalmar proving a good king?
   1000069|00000000||Farewell.
    169111|00000000||Farewell.
   1000074|00000000||Everyone's mourning King Bran's death.
   1000364|00000000||Sad when someone like Bran dies… Everyone says he was a good king.
   1000366|00000000||It's not fittin' to speak elsewise about the dead.
   1000368|00000000||Mean you don't agree?
   1000385|00000000||Bran spent his life at sea, and while he was away, old feuds flared, devourin' the Isles from the inside. Folk grew furious, claimin' there was no one to mediate, resolve quarrels.
   1000387|00000000||But then Bran would return with loot, throw a feast, let the mead flow in rivers… And everyone loved him again.
   1000392|00000000||Your Royal Majesty, would you spare a moment?
   1000394|00000000||C'mon, Geralt. I'm the same lass I was. Save for the title, not a thing's changed.
   1000065|00000000||Got a minute?
   1028780|00000000||Got a thirst for gambling myself. Cards, preferably gwent.
   1028779|00000000||A thirst for gambling.
    421520|00000000||Farewell.
    421516|00000000||Farewell.
    421514|00000000||Show me your goods.
    421518|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
    421512|00000000||Greetings, stranger. Salt air gives a man a powerful thirst, don't it?
    595416|00000000||Jorulf… 'Twas an accident. The Althing cleared you of blame.
    595417|00000000||They couldn't clear my conscience. Let's go.
    595396|00000000||I… I know that longship…
    595398|00000000||Yessssss….. Yesss you do…. 'Tisss your father'sss boat.
    595399|00000000||The shhhhip you wrecked againssssst the rocksss.
    595402|00000000||Losssssst in our sssssweet sssssssong.
    595675|00000000||I'll kill you! Kill all you ploughin' sea whores!
    595403|00000000||Ssssslay us, try. But you'll not ressssstore hissss life.
    595678|00000000||You ssssslew him. A ssssson who killed hissss father.
    367148|00000000||Skeleton's been picked clean… But there's something next to it.
    485986|00000000||That's it!
    485987|00000000||Help!
    485985|00000000||It's here!
    587198|00000000||Take it you have a plan?!
    587199|00000000||You must weaken him while I draw him into the sphere!
    587200|00000000||Care to trade places?
    587203|00000000||Just a bit more! I can feel his strength waning!
    587718|00000000||Something under the fur… a tattoo? Shape of a bear paw.
   1070339|00000000||[Examine torso.]
   1070347|00000000||Old scar… Looks like it was sutured.
   1070340|00000000||[Examine limbs.]
    587721|00000000||Half-man, half-bear. Something like a lycanthrope.
    588371|00000000||No full moon, so something else caused the transformation. Maybe something he ate… or drank.
   1070351|00000000||Mead… Mead with an earthy aroma. Need to check the horns, tankards and bowls.
   1070341|00000000||[Step away.]
   1070338|00000000||[Examine head.]
    587707|00000000||Bear's head, but the tongue's short, like a human's.
    587736|00000000||Mouth smells of honey liqueur, mead… and something else… something… earthy.
   1070345|00000000||Bears like honey… before it's fermented. Strange.
   1070343|00000000||All right. What do we have here…?
    458769|00000000||Retrieved the property you lost.
    458797|00000000||Kuliu? Thanks be to Freya! Where'd you find it?
    458799|00000000||Northern part of the isle, near the whale cemetery. Don't ask me how it got there - long story. At any rate, don't need to worry about the thieves. They won't steal ever again.
    466404|00000000||Your reward - sure as hell earned it. And I'll add a bit more from meself. If Kuliu'd not been found, I'd 'ave had to wash the shame away with me own blood.
    446045|00000000||Got back Kuliu, your sword.
    446049|00000000||So long.
    446047|00000000||Farewell.
    446043|00000000||What is it?
   1025111|00000000||Ehh, you don't know shite. Fresh night crawlers - they're the best bait.
   1025113|00000000||Shove your night crawlers up your arse! In fact, I expect ye already do. Ain't no bait like a wad o' bread!
   1025115|00000000||A wad o' bread… Ah, Hjalte, no wonder ye only catch soggy boots and rusty helmets.
   1073960|00000000||Leave me be, you mangy flappers!
   1075288|00000000||Thanks, witcher. I owe ye me life.
   1055682|b224b6d2||Devourer
   1043243|00000000||Follow me. But no foolishness, eh?
   1043247|00000000||Fuckin' shit, I warned ye!
   1043245|00000000||Where the fuck you goin'? We said, no foolishness. Come back 'fore you regret it.
   1055571|d519a2f3||Merchant
   1050050|00000000||You're quite the swordsman. Just like the tales, even better!
   1024106|00000000||It's borin' just standin' here.
   1024108|00000000||Then sit.
   1024110|00000000||Ye know what I mean. We could be out on a raid, fightin', drinkin', dancin' with wenches till dawn. But this way--
   1024112|00000000||This way not only do I gotta stand here like a stump, but I gotta listen to your whinin' all the while. Shut it, Evald.
    581421|00000000||Pretty weak dragon. Couldn't lift a cow, just tore it up and left it here.
    581422|00000000||Cow's blood… Might lead me to the lair.
    581535|00000000||Giddyup, sheep. Move along, whoo-ah.
    581537|00000000||Finally.
    591055|00000000||You died for a good cause, sheep. Rest in peace.
    591053|00000000||Go on, sheep. Go frolic. You've earned it.
    581420|00000000||Claw marks, bite marks… But no fire damage. Interesting.
   1040036|00000000||Bones shattered… fell from high up.
   1040038|00000000||A nest… A forktail's, looks like. But it's empty. No point waiting, gotta rustle up some bait.
   1054026|00000000||You're never tempted? To visit the old castle ruins?
   1054028|00000000||Must be lyin' there still, everythin' from the battle… swords, axes, jewels.
   1054030|00000000||Better sail out on a raid, do some honest lootin'.
   1054032|00000000||Disturbin' the deads' peace - it ain't right!
    349468|c1769c44||Nekker
    452676|35f90f2a||Shepherd
    157979|00000000||I long, I long to be homeward bound
    157981|00000000||To the modest abode whose corners I roamed
    157983|00000000||To ma da with his pipe, to my two boys, my life
    157985|00000000||To the alcove wherein lies my beautiful wife.
    157987|00000000||So as my strength wanes, and my breath shorter grows
    162345|00000000||And my sinews turn stiff, and my blood's coursing slows
    162347|00000000||It's time, high time I was homeward bound
    411263|00000000||To the modest abode whose corners I roamed.
    580665|00000000||Mind if I take the helm?
    580666|00000000||Ugh. I got a choice?
   1017244|00000000||No.
   1006691|00000000||The ship carrying the djinn sank somewhere in this area.
   1006693|00000000||Not too precise as leads go…
   1006695|00000000||I'll cast a spell on our boat. We'll know if there are any wrecks on the seafloor below us.
    580606|00000000||All right, let's get to work.
    580683|00000000||Geralt, how long must I wait? Are you ready to sail?
    580682|00000000||Getting in or not?
    303055|0037c652||Wolf
   1069962|00000000||Long live Cerys!
   1069964|00000000||Long live Hjalmar!
    582894|00000000||An Craite, 'tis a worthy clan.
    163804|06860285||Siren
   1049999|00000000||They speak true - nothing like a witcher for killing monsters.
    349794|00000000||Yeah, we can hunt 'em together.
    349796|00000000||Grand, let's get goin' then. I've picked up their trail, they shouldn't be far.
    349790|00000000||Yeah, we can work together.
    349798|00000000||Already told you - not interested.
    349792|00000000||Don't count on me.
    349784|00000000||We meet again. So? Ye change your mind? Wanna hunt the Grossbart brothers with me? Easy coin for ye.
   1025693|00000000||A warrior with two blades? One's more'n enough for any who knows how to fight.
   1028750|00000000||Let's play cards. Gwent wouldn't be bad.
   1086471|00000000||Cards - I'd gladly play a round or two.
    421214|00000000||So long.
    421210|00000000||Farewell.
    421194|00000000||Show me what you have.
    421212|00000000||Maybe. Lemme see what you got.
    421208|00000000||Would ye like to buy somethin' from me stash?
    415201|00000000||Heard you're taking on challengers in fistfights.
    415203|00000000||Challengers? Argh, nay. Ain't none a challenge to us.
    452662|00000000||We're here to hit. Hit till our fists're red with blood.
    415218|00000000||Fight or get outta my sight, foreigner.
    410036|00000000||Got lucky once, mutant… But now I'm gonna club you like a seal pup.
    409996|00000000||Look… He's back.
    409998|00000000||Wanna lose some more teeth?
    409994|00000000||Not in the mood to fight.
    415199|00000000||That time o' the month, eh? Get outta here, ye grayin' cunt.
    409990|00000000||Maybe some other time.
    409988|00000000||Let's do this.
    561587|00000000||Hjalmar? Can you…?
    561609|00000000||Ugh, seal shit.
    582528|00000000||Take a look. Still got all my teeth?
    582530|00000000||Most of 'em. Did quite a number on you.
    582692|00000000||Why're you laughin'? They'd 'ave trashed you, too.
    582694|00000000||Huh, doubt it.
    582696|00000000||That so? Care to wager on it? Drop any one of the Vildkaarls, and I'll give you my sword. End up like me… you part with yours.
    584613|00000000||Vildkaarls? Who're they?
    584628|00000000||Vildkaarls? Who're they?
    584630|00000000||Ehh, these wild men, live in the hills.
    584632|00000000||Shepherds, then?
    584634|00000000||Aye. Without the sheep. They live off killin', eat only what they hunt, and they fight like no one else!
    568421|00000000||Thanks. Got scars enough.
    583675|00000000||See your bollocks've shriveled.
    568419|00000000||No, thanks.
    568418|00000000||You're on.
    568420|00000000||You're on. Start wrapping that sword for me.
    583672|00000000||Don't sell your fish till they're in the boat, Wolf.
    409992|00000000||Let's do this.
    415197|00000000||Gladly.
    509696|00000000||Why rarely?
    509720|00000000||Rarely? Why?
    509721|00000000||Well, I don't like to waste time chattin' before fights, and after them I've none left to talk to.
    513712|00000000||And now that I've finally met someone stronger, seems Freya's played a cruel trick on me.
    513715|00000000||What's Freya got to do with it?
    513627|00000000||I swore to the goddess that only he who bested me in battle would lie with me, take me as his wife and give me children.
    509732|00000000||Wrong guy beat you, unfortunately.
    509733|00000000||Yes, I know witchers aren't husband material, nor can they sire children. But it was you who bested me.
    509734|00000000||And I'm sure many warriors in Skellige are worthier of your attention than I am.
    509735|00000000||One would be enough.
    513755|00000000||Never thought of searching the other isles?
    513778|00000000||Hm, you could be right. I believe it may be time to leave Faroe.
    513783|00000000||Well, good luck, Jutta an Dimun.
    509690|00000000||Freya is cruel - wrong guy beat you.
    509689|00000000||I can help you out with the first bit.
    509730|00000000||Can't really help you with the second and the third…
    513703|00000000||But I'm sure I can think of something to satisfy the first.
    509731|00000000||Exactly what I'd hoped for.
    509697|00000000||We don't have to talk.
    509698|00000000||Well, well. And here I thought Freya'd played a trick on me: I swore before her I'd only marry a man who could defeat me in combat.
    509719|00000000||And she sent me a witcher… Cruel irony, wouldn't you say?
    513601|00000000||Are you terribly disappointed?
    513602|00000000||No. 'Cause I see that we understand each other perfectly.
    509695|00000000||We don't have to talk.
    509691|00000000||Greetings.
    509692|00000000||I'd started to think you'd changed your mind.
    509693|00000000||I'd never miss a chance to spend a pleasant evening with you.
    509694|00000000||I don't know that I'll make for engaging company. In truth, I rarely talk to men.
   1023231|00000000||I've something special today. I found some Lyrian lace among the loot from the last raid.
   1023232|00000000||Lace? That's fine for little lasses on the Continent.
   1023234|00000000||But I'll not dress like a Novigrad doll. I'll stick with wool, thank you very much.
    443204|00000000||A disgrace… The kind we've not seen since the Red Funeral!
    443206|00000000||Fewer died then! And not a jarl's son among 'em!
    443208|00000000||If this turns out to be Crach… I'll twist his head off.
    443210|00000000||If Crach appears to be guilty, we will try him in keepin' with our customs.
    443212|00000000||Aye. And then I'll twist his head off!
    172334|06c10782||Skellige Woman
    316717|05a3f51c||Child
    474974|00000000||Swords, eh? Have it your way.
    474972|00000000||A foreigner, too… I won't let this pass.
   1050046|00000000||Was it hard, killin' that vermin?
    586060|00000000||I can vouch for Cerys. She's telling the truth.
    586062|00000000||You? Yet another an Craite lackey?
   1069238|00000000||Did Cerys entice you to cooperate? I can imagine how. Or has Crach paid you to smear my name?
    586066|00000000||What did you say?!
    587479|00000000||Calm yourselves!
    586068|00000000||After what I saw on Spikeroog, I trust the witcher. More than I do you.
    586079|00000000||You've that right. But it's no proof of my guilt.
    559861|00000000||Twas my father's cupbearer Arnvald who helped him. Birna bribed Arnvald. He tried to kill me and the witcher.
    588405|00000000||What?! Arnvald?!
   1069240|00000000||Aww, shite. Arnvald is Crach's loyal dog.
    587470|00000000||I thank you, Lugos… But so be it - let us hear the slander you've commanded him to repeat. Bring him in.
    587472|00000000||He's dead. And I wager it was you who silenced him.
    586022|00000000||I am not surprised to see you lie, Cerys… After all, like father, like daughter. But your lie is clumsy, and that does surprise me.
   1069242|00000000||Silence, Birna! And you, Cerys… How do you aim to prove your accusation?
    586102|00000000||I can vouch for what Cerys says.
    586101|00000000||There's one other piece of evidence.
    559876|00000000||A letter from Birna to Arnvald - instructing him how to spike the mead.
    559877|00000000||It lacks my signature. It lacks my seal.
    559878|00000000||But perfume's soaked through the parchment. A very strong scent, you know. Still to be sensed.
   1070545|00000000||But the hand is that of a woman, and you--
   1070547|00000000||Hahahaha!
    559881|00000000||Is this your proof, lass? Is this what you call evidence of my supposed treason? Don't make me laugh.
   1069257|00000000||Making a big mistake.
   1069261|00000000||You're making a big mistake.
   1069263|00000000||Silence, wanderer.
   1069272|00000000||Wait! Mother… You bade me to leave the hall before the feast. Why?!
   1069274|00000000||Son… Not now.
   1069276|00000000||Why did you do it?! How did you know?! How?!
   1069279|00000000||You stand silent.
   1069282|00000000||You gave Cerys no credence. Gave the witcher no credence. But you must give credence to a son who accuses his own mother.
   1070391|00000000||The massacre was her doing. She's shamed herself, me, the family… the clan!
   1069284|00000000||Svanrige… I did it for you! Only for you!
   1070387|00000000||You admit to this deed.
    588407|00000000||As the eldest of the jarls I cleanse the name of Clan an Craite… and you, Birna Bran, I sentence to death.
   1064209|00000000||You will be chained to a rock to perish of hunger and thirst, and sea fowl will peck apart your remains.
   1069259|00000000||I'm sorry, Cerys.
   1069256|00000000||I'm sorry, Cerys.
   1070537|00000000||Birna's right, Cerys. 'Tis all precious little proof of her wrongdoin'.
   1070540|00000000||Alas, your brother Hjalmar also has not presented anythin' that could clear your family's name… We've but one path left to us.
   1069253|00000000||Holger! Lugos! It's time we quit this damned castle. Come, we must decide what punishment Clan an Craite will face.
   1070560|00000000||Arnvald fled Kaer Trolde, rode to an agreed meeting point. The warriors who awaited him there tried to kill him.
   1070562|00000000||What's that to do with Birna?
   1070564|00000000||Those men wore Clan Tuirseach colors.
   1070566|00000000||This is no proof. It is inconclusive. Anyone might have donned our tartans.
    586077|00000000||Got one more piece of evidence.
    586057|00000000||We've got one other piece of evidence.
    586058|00000000||I can vouch for what Cerys said.
   1069234|00000000||Have you any proof to confirm your accusation?
    559839|00000000||I've better. I've a witness. Arnvald!
    559883|00000000||Cerys speaks true. Birna commanded me to poison the mead. When Cerys and the witcher descended into the cellars--
    586091|00000000||You betrayed us? The clan that took you in?!
    559884|00000000||Good men! He's a servant to an Craite, a lackey! He will say what they command him to say! He would lie for them even were he to pay for it with his head!
   1069236|00000000||Birna speaks true. Arnvald has served at Kaer Trolde ever since I remember. Loyally, like a dog.
   1069164|00000000||I've assembled the jarls in council as you demanded, Cerys an Craite. You claim to know who's behind the slaughter at Kaer Trolde.
   1069170|00000000||Speak, then! The blood of Skellige's sons and daughters - whose hands does it stain?
   1069166|00000000||Birna Bran's.
    586008|00000000||The lass is mad! Do you think anyone will believe you?
    559837|00000000||You had them serve poisoned mead to the berserkers.
   1069230|00000000||I beg your pardon?! The servants of Kaer Trolde are not mine to command! 'Twas your father who called for the feast, who assembled the guests!
   1069232|00000000||There's reason in these words…
    586082|00000000||Hahahahaha!
    586084|00000000||To blacken my clan's name, put your son on the throne. Or would you yourself rule? With the blood of our children on your hands?
    586031|00000000||Svanrige… You… You must believe me. I had naught to do with this. I swear to you!
    586033|00000000||Oh gods… You… You're lying!
    586119|00000000||Your own son stands against you.
    515077|00000000||I know that song. What're you doing here?
    515079|00000000||Look, men, another one. And so many times I've told 'em…
    515081|00000000||What's that you say, Wilfred?
    515083|00000000||Aye, right y'are, they never learn. Least this one heard a song 'fore he died.
    515399|00000000||You the jarl of Undvik?
    515372|00000000||I'm looking for Hjalmar an Craite.
    515196|00000000||I'm looking for Hjalmar an Craite. Word is he came to this isle with a crew. Aimed to defeat the giant.
    515198|00000000||Aye, saw him. As did Wilmar.
    515200|00000000||Sure it was him?
    515202|00000000||Wilmar's got eyes like a hawk! They stood where you stand now. Poor shape they were in. Leif the Red, Folan, Vigi…
    515767|00000000||Just 'tween you and me, that boy is not quite right in the head.
    515769|00000000||Oh, the young an Craite was here, too.
    515750|00000000||They recognize you?
    515765|00000000||No… Thank the gods.
    515791|00000000||When was this?
    515793|00000000||Remember when this was?
    515795|00000000||When what was?
    515797|00000000||When Hjalmar an Craite was here with his men.
    515799|00000000||Oh, that! No, I don't remember. Ya might ask Wilhelm, though.
    515790|00000000||Where'd they go?
    515801|00000000||They say where they were headed?
    515808|00000000||Did they, Wilmar? Oh, aye. Aimed to make camp in the old guard tower.
    515815|00000000||Easy enough to find. Stands in the middle of a valley, guardin' absolutely nothin'.
    516024|00000000||Try to come back for you, once I've found Hjalmar.
    516029|00000000||Hahaha! Sound awfully sure you'll find him. Maybe you can kill the giant while you're at it? All on your own.
    516036|00000000||They're the same to a man, aren't they, Wilhelm? All think themselves immortal.
    516040|00000000||Gotta go. So long.
    516044|00000000||Ey, if you really aim to return, mind bringin' me some solid twine? You're like to find it in the village.
    516045|00000000||And nails! We're short on nails. Can you remember that? Nails and twine.
    516047|00000000||I'll remember.
    515825|00000000||Try to come back for you, later.
    515826|00000000||Farewell.
    516013|00000000||Thanks for your help. Take care.
    515375|00000000||Farewell.
    515377|00000000||Farewell.
    515420|00000000||I should go.
    515423|00000000||Fare ye well.
    515684|00000000||Refugees from Undvik, they've found a safe haven there.
    515701|00000000||Aye, they all fled… But see, I promised me crew we'd not leave the isle.
    515706|00000000||And we've still got work to do. Oh, she'll be a lovely longship when we're done.
    515677|00000000||Your people have found shelter there. And you're still their leader.
    515679|00000000||My people… Oh, aye, they can come back now. Look alive, crew! We've got to hurry.
    515682|00000000||Gotta finish her! Oh, she'll be a lovely vessel. Perfect for a funeral.
    515644|00000000||I killed the giant.
    515659|00000000||Killed 'im? Did what me whole crew couldn't?! Hear that, lads? Are ye not ashamed?
    515662|00000000||When you're done talking to yourself, sail back to Ard Skellig with me.
    515384|00000000||Giant's dead.
    524592|00000000||Got nails and twine for you.
    524600|00000000||Got nails and twine for you.
    524602|00000000||Wha? Oh, yes…
    524604|00000000||Finally, poor Wilhelm's ear will stay put…
    524593|00000000||Got nails and twine for you.
    515376|00000000||The skulls – where'd they come from?
    515455|00000000||Why'd the giant spare you?
    515457|00000000||Me and me crew and the sirens - we're helpin' him build a longship. I sew the sails and run away atimes, and then the sirens fly out and bring me back.
    515459|00000000||Why'd he want a ship?
    515465|00000000||He'll sail out on her to defeat the gods durin' the Final Battle 'Fore the World's End.
    515470|00000000||Hm. Think he's had a change of heart.
    515453|00000000||Why'd the giant spare you?
    515385|00000000||You the jarl of Undvik?
    515481|00000000||You're Harald Houndsnout, jarl of Undvik? Heard you were dead.
    515618|00000000||We look like stiffs to you, me and me lads?
    515621|00000000||Er…well…
    515623|00000000||Exactly.
    515626|00000000||So, they all think me dead, you say?
    515628|00000000||Mayhaps it's for the best…
    515665|00000000||What's the giant feed you?
    515236|00000000||Not much game here, but I saw the giant give you food. Where's he get it?
    515238|00000000||Don't know, don't ask. Food suits me, suits me crew…
    515240|00000000||Over there, on the ground. Hand's got bite marks on it…
    515242|00000000||Wha? Where? Wilmar, dammit, you're supposed to clean up! Couldn't keep a secret if yer life depended on it.
    515244|00000000||We had a choice - that or starve to death… But I didn't force anyone, you know. Whole crew voted in favor.
    515374|00000000||Why'd the giant spare you?
    515138|00000000||Why'd the giant spare you?
    515140|00000000||Me and me crew and the sirens - we're helpin' him build a longship. I sew the sails and run away atimes, and then the sirens fly out and bring me back.
    515142|00000000||Why does he need a ship? Where's he want to go?
    515144|00000000||Promise not to tell no one? I trust my men to take the secret to their graves, but you?
    515146|00000000||Promise. Won't tell anyone.
    515148|00000000||Fine then. The giant's going to sail her out to defeat the gods come Ragh nar Roog - the Final Battle 'Fore the World's End. She'll soon be ready.
    515373|00000000||The skulls – where'd they come from?
    515127|00000000||Who were these men?
    515129|00000000||My crew. They swore never to leave me. Kept their word.
    515403|00000000||Tall one's Wilmar. Wilfred's to his right. And the lad with the stutter's Wilhelm.
    515131|00000000||Why'd you… and your crew… stay?
    515133|00000000||We cannot leave. If we ventured it again, the giant would kill us all. Like he did the others.
    515074|00000000||Look there, crew - White-Hair's returned! What brings you to us?
    572370|00018392||Earth Elemental
    449094|00000000||Whaddaya want now? Sod off or I'll send your teeth down your throat and out your arse!
   1049348|00000000||Go. Leave me to me grief.
    348004|00000000||Watch out!
    477733|3fbb3904||Nilfgaardian Officer
    479186|00000000||Sure you're not overreacting?
    479436|00000000||Don't exaggerate. It's just--
    479438|00000000||No, Geralt. This no "just"!
    479707|00000000||How'd you get this mask?
    479732|00000000||Where'd you get this mask?
    479785|00000000||Sailors from clan Dimun pulled it from the sea. Near the Njord Trench.
    479786|00000000||Yeah, but how can you be sure this is Uroboros' mask?
    479841|00000000||Its appearance is exactly as described in the myths.
    479849|00000000||She did it for Ciri.
    480008|00000000||On the one hand a theft. On the other, Ciri's life…
    480010|00000000||I also care deeply for the girl. I proposed a series of other methods. Yennefer refused to listen!
    480011|00000000||She claimed they would take too long, whereas she wants, she needs immediate results!
    480013|00000000||She has always been hot-headed.
    480019|00000000||True. Least this time she's got a valid reason for it.
    480025|00000000||Never mind that she might bring--
    479850|00000000||We've got Crach's permission.
    480026|00000000||Theft or no theft, Crach gave us free rein.
    480095|00000000||First off, this might indeed be his isle, but we the druids watch that no alien magic takes hold here.
    480158|00000000||Secondly, after the cataclysm occurred, Crach turned to us for help, entrusted this site to our care.
    480177|00000000||Third--
    479964|00000000||Wha… what was that?
    479967|00000000||No! Yennefer's used the Mask!
    479854|00000000||I'm not about to justify what Yennefer did…
    479867|00000000||Then don't!
    479868|00000000||… but try to understand her.
    479927|00000000||She's not doing this to anger you, she's doing it for Ciri.
    479934|00000000||I know there are maternal feelings at play, but this is no excuse, no justification.
    479935|00000000||The Mask of Uroboros belongs to Skellige and should be used for the good of the Isles!
    479944|00000000||If Yennefer uses it now, it shall lose its power, not to mention--
    479848|00000000||Try to understand Yen.
    479843|00000000||You believe the myths?
    479845|00000000||Only ignorant fools belittle their significance.
    479847|00000000||Besides, it's not the myths that are on trial here! It's the thief!
    479708|00000000||So… No one's ever used the Mask?
    479783|00000000||No… But…
    479787|00000000||So you don't actually know if it works, how it works?
    479809|00000000||Of course I do. The myths tell me.
    479680|00000000||Anyone ever used it?
    479820|00000000||When the Sea learned of the Mask, it was quick to respond. It made known its threat that whosoever used the Mask would bring the Sea's wrath down on them. For in vengeance the Sea would rise and flood all the lands and drown the living.
    479581|00000000||The myth is that Uroboros created the Mask when the envious Sea swallowed his beloved.
    479582|00000000||Unable to bear the prospect that he would never again see his betrothed, Uroboros made the Mask, which would allow him to peer into the past.
    479686|00000000||He knew, however, that he could only use it once. So he waited. Waited until his longing grew so strong that it became unbearable.
    479433|00000000||Bury? What're you talking about?
    479434|00000000||She's not told you? Might've expected as much!
    479185|00000000||What're you talking about?
    475924|00000000||Can hear you two clear on the other side of the island.
    475926|00000000||Good! May all Skellige know Yennefer of Vengerberg is a common thief!
    478816|00000000||Control yourself, druid. I haven't stolen anything. I've merely borrowed something and fully intend to return it.
    478817|00000000||Hah! The generosity! Just one small problem - once used, the mask is rendered completely worthless!
    478818|00000000||Not to mention the risk you'll bury us alive! And all the Isles with us!
    158224|00000000||Can you walk?
    158226|00000000||Argh. Aye, I'll manage.
    443115|00000000||Let's get out of here.
    158228|00000000||You all right?
    158235|00000000||Never go in a sauna again, long as I live. Other than that, I think I'm fine. Ye saved me life. How can I thank you?
    497235|00000000||What're you doing on Undvik?
    497240|00000000||Sailed here with Hjalmar an Craite aimin' to kill the ice giant. We were to take its head, take back the isle, then bask in the glory, but…
    497245|00000000||Things not go according to plan?
    497258|00000000||I've no notion where the others are. Those that survived, that is…
    497233|00000000||Thank me with a story.
    497229|00000000||I'm looking for Hjalmar.
    158249|00000000||Hjalmar? Curious where he is meself - him and the whole crew.
    424484|00000000||Somethin' must've happened. Otherwise he'd 'ave come lookin' for me after I went missin' that night. I know he would've.
    517424|00000000||Wait now... Why're you lookin' for Hjalmar?
    311208|00000000||What did your helmsman do?
    311212|00000000||Helmsman made a mistake?
    311214|00000000||I'd say his ma made the mistake - birthed him arseways or somethin'. Dim, that one. Heard tales and was so afeared of sirens he stuffed wax in his ears. Failed to hear our warnin' calls.
    415312|00000000||Steered us right into the rocks.
    311220|00000000||Lost a few men, had to drag the wounded on litters. And the sirens pestered us the whole while.
    415326|00000000||Hjalmar kept blowin' his horn, but we'd come too close to the hillside and he brought an avalanche down on us.
    311243|00000000||Not your lucky day, it seems. What happened next?
    311245|00000000||We found that daft bugger in the ship, then pitched camp near the guard tower.
    517650|00000000||Things seemed to calm.
    517306|00000000||Crach sent me to help Hjalmar.
    517458|00000000||Crach sent me here to find Hjalmar. New king''ll soon be chosen on Ard Skellig. Everybody's waiting for the young an Craite's return.
    517483|00000000||So it's started already. Hjalmar, ruler of all Skellige…
    517484|00000000||Doubt he's cut out for it?
    517509|00000000||Hjalmar's irresponsible, stubborn and heeds no counsel. But he's a born leader.
    517516|00000000||Been mates since we were lads. With him and Cerys.
    517517|00000000||Cerys has put forth her claim to the throne as well.
    517519|00000000||Cerys?! But she's-- Well, she's…
    517542|00000000||It was pretty much a shock to everyone.
    517543|00000000||Crach, too? Or did he encourage her? Tell her to set off on some mad quest?
    517528|00000000||Everyone was shocked.
    517527|00000000||She's just like her father, Crach.
    517544|00000000||Like father, like daughter.
    517548|00000000||What about Crach? He support her? He let her set off on some daft quest?
    517538|00000000||Wasn't thrilled. Especially since Cerys set out without telling him.
    517540|00000000||Nor did she tell me. Where'd she go? Who'd she take with her?
    517567|00000000||Spikeroog. And no one.
    517569|00000000||She went alone! Damn the dogs! If Hjalmar'd only… Has she come back? D'you know?
    517597|00000000||Yeah, she's back. Did what she set out to do, too.
    517621|00000000||Thank the gods.
    517575|00000000||Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
    517293|00000000||Where'd Hjalmar think the ice giant was?
    517349|00000000||Any idea where Hjalmar thought he might find the giant?
    517365|00000000||We'd learned where it has its lair - in the caves above the village. Hjalmar decided the best way there'd be to cross the lake.
    517422|00000000||Vigi the Loon insisted he knew a better way - through the mines. But none of us fancied strollin' into a monster pit.
    163546|00000000||How'd you and the others get separated?
    495708|00000000||How'd you get separated from the others?
    158312|00000000||Had the watch for the night. Saw Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's hornwall horn, one he uses to drive away sirens. Bugger snuck outta camp. I followed him.
    517364|00000000||No idea what got into that ginger head of his. Told Hjalmar not to take him with us - a thousand times, at least.
    495710|00000000||And? You catch up to him?
    495711|00000000||Aye, in these caves. Bastard screeched so loud he drew the trolls. Thought the buggers'd eat me right then. Dropped me in a marinade, instead.
    495735|00000000||Decided I was ready to cook today… Woulda been the end of me if not for you.
    162953|00000000||Wait, I'll go with you. Luckily the trolls didn't use my bow for kindling.
    162470|00000000||Think I know enough. So long.
    163548|00000000||I know enough.
    169315|00000000||Tell me about the expedition.
    169313|00000000||The expedition - tell me about it.
    158324|00000000||Started like the best ballads - with a hearty storm. Sail whipped about like a rag!
    525447|00000000||Finally caught sight of shore, but then sirens attacked. As if they'd just been bidin' their time!
    525449|00000000||But we'd 'ave come through somehow, I know it… if not for the bloody helmsman.
    311210|00000000||What happened on the island?
    311247|00000000||You smashed into the rocks. What then?
    415350|00000000||Good. Let's go.
    490194|00000000||Gotta calm him or this won't work.
    490193|00000000||Had a feeling I'd need the Axii.
    579095|00000000||Just had to stop by that damned tavern…
    545946|00000000||Oh, this again.
    546544|00000000||Crach's son Hjalmar, his head's melted! He sailed off to kill the Ice Giant!
    546546|00000000||How d'you know that's true?
    546548|00000000||You believe that? Cursed trees and flyin' phantoms?
    546550|00000000||You takin' the piss?
    545948|00000000||Ahoy?
    545950|00000000||Leave me be. Nothin' were bitin' today…
    545952|00000000||Whadda you want, stranger?
    546295|00000000||Don't know ye.
   1042609|00000000||Godless defiler, begone!
   1042606|00000000||Mörhogg's wraiths take ye! You and that witch Yennefer both!
   1042825|00000000||It's yours and the witch's doin' that Freya cursed the sacred garden!
    545954|00000000||No one asked you to the Isles.
    545956|00000000||Eh?
    546287|00000000||Wha!
    546289|00000000||Take cover! Cover!
    546291|00000000||By Hemdall!
    546293|00000000||…That I might bear all burdens and not want for strength…
    393389|00000000||You saved my life, killer…
    393691|00000000||I'd be a corpse if not for you…
    585100|00000000||Cerys'll make a good queen. Maybe she can finally unite the clans.
    585102|00000000||Let's hope. And if not, she'll always have me and Hjalmar. If the need arises, we'll take up arms for her.
    585104|00000000||Hjalmar'll make a good king, provided you help him rein in his temper a bit.
    585106|00000000||It'll depend on the matter. His brawlin' days are over, granted. But if he decides to sail against Nilfgaard, he can count on my blade.
    585090|00000000||Congratulations. Must be proud.
    585092|00000000||Looks to me you're near bursting with pride.
    585094|00000000||Hah! If only you knew, Wolf! Tell me - what other jarl can boast children like mine?
    585096|00000000||Shame their mother didn't live to see this…
   1069126|00000000||Shit… He's fast.
   1069124|00000000||Come on, Roach!
    569134|00000000||You don't stand a chance!
    569135|00000000||We'll see about that!
    574693|00000000||Sure am.
    574696|00000000||Grab a horse. People! We've a third! Joinin' Bald Sigge and Fishbreath Aegir will be Geralt of Rivia!
    574690|00000000||Sure.
    574692|00000000||Maybe later. So long.
    574691|00000000||Maybe later.
    574687|00000000||Glad you're here - we're one short of startin' the race. You up for it?
    466798|d34a65a7||Arachas
   1007197|00000000||Step back a bit.
   1008678|00000000||What are you going do?
    583137|00000000||Summon and tame the djinn. It's not likely to be happy. Stand at the ready.
   1018034|00000000||Cáemm d'jinn, vryff cais'te aem gyhar!
   1018036|00000000||Cais'te aet disgleir! Gveryd me cassel!
   1018030|00000000||Grrrr…
    593452|00000000||Radhee vulten imho adenn!
   1007174|00000000||He's stronger than I thought!
   1007175|00000000||Dammit it all!
    593451|00000000||Radhee vulten imho adenn!
   1055640|8e12246e||Yorg's Sister
    481086|00000000||Nice fight.
    481088|00000000||One repelled the other with powerful magic, then fled through a portal.
    376361|00000000||A mage?
    376363|00000000||Most likely.
    585453|00000000||If there's one thing I'm not afraid of, it's nekkers.
    594545|00000000||Tis but the start. Real challenge awaits at the cave's end.
    585454|00000000||Know what we call nekkers in Skellige?
    585455|00000000||No idea.
    594672|00000000||Nilfgaardbarne. Children of Nilfgaard. 'Cause they're black, cowardly and bloodthirsty.
    586071|00000000||Hey, Geralt! Where you goin'?
    498107|00000000||Shattered… Udalryk must've been scared of seeing the creature just behind him.
    532202|00000000||Hm.
    532204|00000000||Damn. I tore a hole in my dress. Wait a minute, I must mend it.
    532206|00000000||Know how to sew?
    532208|00000000||Please. I'll enchant a needle.
   1057972|00000000||Really wonder if Crach'll be willing to help…
   1057974|00000000||He knew Ciri well. She and Hjalmar played together as children.
   1057977|00000000||There. Good as new.
   1057979|00000000||Let's get back to the wake.
   1057964|00000000||We should get back to the wake.
   1057963|00000000||Wouldn't mind watching…
    532158|00000000||Wait.
    532159|00000000||For what?
    532160|00000000||We must talk to Crach.
    532161|00000000||Why? Think he misses us? Because I missed you.
    532162|00000000||Oh no.
    532164|00000000||I missed you too.
    532167|00000000||When are you gonna finally burn this piece of junk?
    532170|00000000||My heart couldn't take it.
    532173|00000000||So many memories.
    532176|00000000||Come here. We gotta hurry. Crach's waiting.
    532178|00000000||Is that so?
    532180|00000000||Yen, let go of the mane.
    532181|00000000||I know you. I let go - you throw us off.
    532183|00000000||Ugh.
    532185|00000000||Don't even try.
    532175|00000000||Dammit, Geralt. Do you have any idea how much they cost?
    509040|00000000||My oh my.
    509042|00000000||Missed you.
    509044|00000000||I missed you too.
    507107|00000000||We oughta get back to the wake.
    521232|00000000||I must dress. Turn around.
    586913|00000000||You think you got no chance?
    586927|00000000||You think you stand a chance?
    586929|00000000||I don't know. That doesn't mean I'm givin' up. I'd never do that.
    586931|00000000||Course you wouldn't.
    586934|00000000||It's just, after Udalryk, solving his grief, I thought I'd gained some respect. Thought they were takin' me serious.
    586936|00000000||But no. Every step of the way I have to prove I'm fit to be queen.
    586941|00000000||Better get back to your guests. Won't gain any votes talking to me.
    586943|00000000||You're right… Till later, Geralt.
    586919|00000000||You're his sister. It's natural.
    586921|00000000||We've always argued, but I thought somethin' like this… Thought he'd show some respect. But he's just attackin' me.
    586923|00000000||Would you prefer he ignored you, refused to see you as a rival?
    586925|00000000||Perhaps you're right.
    586912|00000000||It's natural - you're his sister.
    586903|00000000||Cerys.
    586905|00000000||Heard us, didn't you.
    586909|00000000||So did everyone in that room who's not completely deaf.
    586911|00000000||Hjalmar wastes his time arguin' with me, and I really don't know why… Everyone says I've no chance against him when it comes to the crown.
   1051775|00000000||My line doesn't have too rosy a future anyway, but never mind that. What do I do?
   1051779|00000000||There's a lake here on Ard Skellig, near Blandare. A lone hut on its shore. We'll meet there. It's where I tell ye what comes next.
   1051783|00000000||Don't tarry long. Or you'll have me thinkin' you're tryin' to weasel out… and you don't want Simun Brambling to be thinkin' that.
   1051772|00000000||Fine. What do I gotta do?
   1051785|00000000||Same old Skellige shit: "Honor this, shame on that, glory to the other…" Dead tired of it.
   1051789|00000000||Not about to let you drag me into some mess just 'cause you say it's the right thing to do. Count me out, Simun. And don't bother me again.
   1051791|00000000||As you will, witcher. But beware… Break an oath in Skellige, you're likely shortenin' your life.
   1051773|00000000||Count me out.
   1051912|00000000||Need to know what you want first.
   1051917|00000000||Gotta tell me what it's about first.
   1051919|00000000||And I say ye needn't know. It's honor binds you to do what I say. Do whatever I fancy askin' ye.
   1051767|00000000||Greetings, Simun. Lugos decide to let you go?
   1051769|00000000||Nay. It was me decided to leave. Time's come to settle some scores. And you're gonna help me.
   1051771|00000000||A favor for a favor, remember? You owe me a debt. Pay it… or cover you and your whole line with shame.
   1051763|00000000||Oi there, witcher! C'mere a minute. Case your wonderin', Simun Brambling's askin'!
    451784|00000000||So that's how long a man's gotta wait till someone shows up. C'mon, lads, get to work! Grab 'im!
   1071231|00000000||For the glory o' the Isles!
   1071360|00000000||Into the fire!
   1071362|00000000||Hurraaaaarrgh!
    472898|00306a9c||Girl
   1075600|00000000||Ye should face Valgard. A worthy opponent.
   1047182|00000000||Wonder how you'll fare 'gainst Valgard of Kaer Trolde… Or Einar on Faroe. 'Cause those are the two you gotta defeat to become champion of Skellige.
   1075602|00000000||If brawlin's in your nature and ye care to continue, there's Einar still to fight.
    522067|00000000||Ye fought well. You've earned the right to face Olaf of An Skellig. Good luck to ye, heehee.
    522063|00000000||Geralt the Traveler wins it!
    522064|00000000||Freya dammit.
    522065|00000000||Grim wins it, soundly defeatin' Geralt the Traveler! O' course, the loser may demand a rematch - if he's man enough!
   1022098|2ea91a43||Sigo Buntz
   1018129|00000000||Couldn't help overhearing your conversation. Trial of the Path - what is it?
   1018130|00000000||An age-old An Skellig tradition. Young men must complete the Path. Only then do they turn true warriors.
   1018131|00000000||So what's this path like?
   1018132|00000000||Old Gunnar can tell ye all ye wanna know about the Path of Warriors. He's the one leads the ritual. Lives at the foot of Mount Aardeklove.
    387364|00000000||See Snorri struttin' around in finery? Gleamin' with gold, that one. Had to squint from the glare!
    387366|00000000||They say he means to ask Yorun for her hand the-day.
    389507|00000000||Her hand's all he'll get. Not a one don't know she's only got eyes for Hroker.
    389509|00000000||Snorri's not dressed up for Yorun - it's her father he aims to impress. Riches be the first and only thing the man looks for in a son-in-law.
    461008|c85134b5||Katakan
   1021323|00000000||What's this?
   1021325|00000000||It's, uh… adornment. I engraved it.
   1021327|00000000||Melt this blade and forge it again. A sword's for cuttin', not lookin' pretty.
    520836|00000000||Fightin's about to begin!
    520837|00000000||Outlanders're welcome to try, too! Glory and honor range every which where.
    170734|00017dcc||Boy
   1064575|00000000||Yen and I went to Hindarsfjall.
   1064577|00000000||Oh! Did you learn anything?
   1064599|00000000||Ciri came through Lofoten. She was wounded when she arrived. Villagers nursed her back to health.
   1064601|00000000||Sadly, the Wild Hunt was on her trail, followed here there. Ciri managed to escape, but the villagers--
   1064605|00000000||I know. You needn't finish. I later spoke to those who survived.
   1064607|00000000||Suffice to say Ciri was fortunate to escape. I trust you'll find her soon.
   1064569|00000000||Think I should tell you what happened on Hindarsfjall.
   1002465|00000000||You were made a hierophant. Congratulations.
   1002467|00000000||I thank you. The Skellige Circle chose me years ago, about the time when the old disputes between the clans were reigniting.
   1002469|00000000||Job's been mainly politics, then?
   1002471|00000000||Aye, but I've not minded. Since time immemorial the druids have wandered betwixt the clans, keeping endless feuds in check.
   1002473|00000000||We care for equilibrium, the balance of all things, not just trout populations in streams. We're lucky the jarls always valued us as advisors.
   1002407|00000000||You're a hierophant now?
   1002475|00000000||The war - curious to know your opinion.
   1002477|00000000||Well… I believe Emhyr's chosen a poor time to wage it.
   1002479|00000000||Hard to find any better, as I see it, with the North now in disarray.
   1002481|00000000||The North is weak, true, but I've the impression the emperor's dealing with some domestic strife. Far too much to start a war.
   1002485|00000000||Radovid is a madman, but a cunning one. He's certain to take advantage.
   1002408|00000000||The war - how will it end?
    168467|00000000||Farewell.
    167946|00000000||Farewell.
    349481|00000000||Any thoughts on Skellige's new ruler?
   1002446|00000000||What do the druids think of Skellige's new ruler?
   1002412|00000000||Svanrige will be but a tool in his mother's hands.
   1002414|00000000||I've long said Birna would never relinquish power after Bran's death.
   1002416|00000000||Shoulda claimed the throne for herself. Why didn't she?
   1002418|00000000||There are those who act openly, those who prefer the shadows. Birna is clearly one of the latter.
   1002420|00000000||I expect in the end she will cross the clans, encourage feuds between them, then try to parley with the emperor.
   1002422|00000000||Emperor signing a treaty with Skellige? Doubt it somehow.
   1002424|00000000||It's possible, though not as equal with equal.
   1002410|00000000||An Craite blood is good blood.
   1002426|00000000||Yet Cerys is the first woman to rule Skellige. Ever.
   1002428|00000000||Not everyone's pleased?
   1002432|00000000||There are seven clans in Skellige. Each would like a king from their own line. But Cerys will manage.
   1002434|00000000||She's not as impulsive as Hjalmar. Thinks first, then acts. With Crach as her advisor, she has every chance to be a good queen.
   1002436|00000000||Hjalmar is a good warrior. We shall soon see what kind of politician he will make.
   1002438|00000000||Betting he'll listen to his father's counsel. And probably sink any possible accord with Nilfgaard.
   1002444|00000000||That is certain. As long as any an Craite sits the throne of Skellige, there is no hope for peace with Nilfgaard.
   1002448|00000000||Can we talk?
   1055702|5ec210eb||Drowned Dead
    557059|00000000||Arhaaam shinaaaz!
    557061|00000000||Hm... Geralt. Nice to meet you.
    557065|00000000||Ashk'harr ondh'daw!
    523729|00000000||Varhar sheezah!
    504057|00000000||[Put the baby in the oven.]
    504055|00000000||Arrrgghh!
    485941|00000000||[Place the infant in the oven.]
    485942|00000000||[Hand the infant to Udalryk.]
   1065837|00000000||Just made yourself an enemy.
   1065839|00000000||I'd 'ave made no such thing if you'd only trusted me.
   1065841|00000000||And tossed an infant in the oven? I don't think so.
   1065843|00000000||The babe would've been fine. Round back the oven there's another door. I'd 'ave pulled the child out before the flames could even warm him.
   1065845|00000000||The hym would've thought you'd killed the tyke, it would've abandoned Udalryk. I'd 'ave showed it the babe then, safe and sound. It would've had to go.
   1064442|00000000||Hmm… Not a bad scheme. Just… risky. I'd rather do it the witchers' way.
   1065855|00000000||Lemme talk to Udalryk. I'll explain what you wanted, what happened here.
    504098|00000000||Cerys had a plan. But we'll do it my way.
    579325|00000000||I'll deal with you later.
    504101|00000000||Let's go.
    504104|00000000||The hym won't leave on its own. This isn't over.
    504058|00000000||[Give the baby to Udalryk.]
    430911|00000000||O'er there! She's runnin' to the old house!
    430913|00000000||Grab her!
    430917|00000000||Take him!
    488791|00000000||You must put him in the oven! Trust me.
    504051|00000000||Take care not to hurt the child!
    579315|00000000||Give me the babe.
    504053|00000000||In the oven! Throw him in the oven!
    504060|00000000||Ugh!
    504065|00000000||Ugggh!
    504072|00000000||Why…?
    504075|00000000||Aki!
    504078|00000000||The witcher committed no crime. You'll find neither despair nor guilt here. Only shock and relief.
    504091|00000000||You've been tricked. You must go.
    480936|00000000||Greetin's.
    480928|00000000||Druids aren't any good with wraiths…
    480929|00000000||Oh? Suppose you're better?
    480930|00000000||Shut your gob, he's better than any. That's a witcher, there.
    503110|00000000||Listen - it's our arena, got a wraith that haunts it. Damned if we know how to drive it off. Think you could manage?
    481220|00000000||Ghost shouldn't pester you anymore. Drinking mead with his ancestors by now.
    481221|00000000||Hah! Knew you'd manage it! Well, Gunnar, me winnings…
    503307|00000000||Here…
    503309|00000000||You bet on it?
    503311|00000000||Shoulda seen it! I said you'd pull it off, Gunnar said there weren't a chance. It's why he's got that sheep's arse frown now.
    481222|00000000||See that frown often - when it's time for me to get paid.
    481223|00000000||You needn't fret, we're honorable folk here. This is for you.
    503316|00000000||And remember - you get a cut o' the earnin's once we get the arena up and runnin' again.
    481226|00000000||I'll remember that. So long.
   1056448|00000000||Come again, eh?! Great things're bound to happen 'ere. Mark my words!
   1056462|00000000||I hope they do. Good luck.
    503302|00000000||Thanks. So long.
    480998|00000000||Know anything about this specter? When'd it first appear?
    481000|00000000||Me grandda told me his grandda said the wraith was called Ulle the Unlucky. Lost every bout he entered, yet always recovered from his wounds. Ulle weren't even able to die like a man!
   1043882|00000000||Till one day Jarl Thormar called a tournament in the arena. In those days they drew lots to choose their foes, and the jarl drew Ulle the Unlucky.
   1043884|00000000||Jarl was cock sure he'd win, so he mocked Ulle, ridiculed him till all in the stands were cryin' with laughter. Finally, he raised his arms in triumph. And that's when Ulle, who couldn't take it no more, stuck a dagger in his back.
   1043886|00000000||As he died, Thormar cursed Ulle: "May ye lose again and again, for centuries on end." That's what he said. Ever since, Ulle's haunted the arena, lookin' for a fight, and gettin' a few.
   1043888|00000000||Mean there've been those who've tried to defeat him?
   1043890|00000000||You kiddin'? Everyone's beaten 'im! Poor bugger keeps comin' back, though. Can't organize no normal fights precisely 'cause o' that.
    480950|00000000||What exactly's the matter?
    480953|00000000||This wraith - I can probably manage it. Need the details.
    480954|00000000||What do you wanna know?
    481144|00000000||What kind of an arena is this?
    481145|00000000||It's an arena, like any other.
    503149|00000000||The custom was for the best warriors to clash here. Spikeroog bouts were famous all across Skellige!
    503166|00000000||Then one day a wraith showed up…
    503168|00000000||How did ye know?
    503169|00000000||Told ye, he's a witcher, a cunning man. He knows these things!
   1058507|00000000||Tell me a bit about the arena?
    480994|00000000||This arena - what's it for?
    481163|00000000||All right, could try my hand at driving away this specter… Not for free, though.
    481165|00000000||Get it done, and we'll pay you the champion's purse!
    503270|00000000||And a premium from our earnin's to come, once the fightin' begins after the curse is lifted!
    503272|00000000||Oh! Sure you're not gettin' carried away there…?
    503273|00000000||A little, aye… but fuck it! Witcher gets rid o' the wraith, he'll deserve a premium from the earnin's, he will!
   1073427|00000000||So be it… One time only, though.
    503262|00000000||Sounds reasonable. Wait for me here - shouldn't be too long.
    480996|00000000||I'll take the job.
    480952|00000000||Don't have time for this. So long.
    481173|00000000||Sorry, not interested. So long.
    481175|00000000||So don't go in there.
    545371|00000000||But if ye change your mind, a reward awaits.
    480997|00000000||Not interested.
    480995|00000000||What kind of wraith're we talking about?
   1058506|00000000||This ghost - what's it like?
   1058508|00000000||Farewell.
    481227|00000000||Wraith's gone. You can start organizing fights again.
    481228|00000000||What? Easy as that…?
    481229|00000000||Nothing's ever easy with specters.
    481230|00000000||Aye, I believe it took effort… And effort deserves compensation.
    480951|00000000||Got rid of the ghost.
    481190|00000000||How's my cut of the earnings doing?
    481206|00000000||Business is booming, far as I can see…
    481207|00000000||Better believe it! Every man and his hound wants to fight in the Cursed Arena!
    481208|00000000||My cut of the proceeds must've grown sizeable…
    481209|00000000||And how! Here.
    503357|00000000||Always a pleasure doing business in Skellige.
   1036744|00000000||Oh, witcher. Changed your mind, have ye?
    499376|00000000||Lookin' for a nook, lovebirds? Look elsewhere.
    499377|00000000||Castle staff only!
    382821|00000000||Ran off to its lair to lick its wounds. Need to track it down.
   1086645|c2ee1ad6||Clan Drummond Guard
   1023257|00000000||Need any help, Uncle? I'll work hard all day for a bowl o' soup, that's all.
   1023259|00000000||Go home, lad. Your parents should feed ye.
   1023261|00000000||Da didn't come home from the raid. Mum's carin' for me sick sis. Please, Uncle.
   1023263|00000000||Ehh… Look. The hide's gotta soak for two days. Once it has, ye scrape off the bits of flesh, like this…
   1021880|00000000||Right… I'll take half and the horns, you take the other half and the hide.
   1021882|00000000||And what'll we leave for the gods?
   1021884|00000000||The gods can hunt their own.
   1086643|1f35a46f||Clan Brokvar Guard
   1047797|00000000||Wonder if anyone survived…?
   1073762|00000000||Bandages? Strange…
   1073764|00000000||A buckhorn, sage and bread poultice… Someone was hurt, had their wounds dressed.
   1073766|00000000||Priestesses of Freya would've tended to any survivors. Only ones around here with any notion about medical care.
    578720|00000000||Aye, Geralt?
    329680|00000000||Oh! What a fight! Smacked his gob so hard it's a wonder his brain didn't fly out o' his ears!
    415239|00000000||Well, lost the wager. But that were such a spectacle I don't even mind! Here, may it serve you well!
    329664|00000000||Here. May it serve you well.
    329666|00000000||Hah! Can't wait to test a witcher's blade in battle!
    329656|00000000||Here.
    329668|00000000||Listen, how about I give you the equivalent in coin instead of my sword? After all, can't really earn a living without it.
    329670|00000000||Shouldn't 'ave bet it then!
    445030|00000000||But… fine. Owe you that much, for old time's sake. Pay up, and keep it!
    329658|00000000||Rather give you the equivalent in coin.
    348530|00000000||Heheh, not so tough without your blade. Which is too bad, 'cause you just lost it!
    584438|00000000||What now?
    584440|00000000||I'll tell the jarls what we found here. Hope it's enough to clear the clan's name.
    584442|00000000||C'mon. We're done here.
    584435|00000000||What now?
    584436|00000000||Any suspects?
    584454|00000000||Suspect anyone?
    587701|00000000||I know many who crave the crown… But none who'd stoop so low to get it.
    584456|00000000||Whoever it is, they could strike again.
    584458|00000000||And I'll be on my guard.
    587705|00000000||There's someone else behind it all, all the mayhem.
    587703|00000000||You were right…
    585022|00000000||Not afraid to die. Gotta give 'em that.
    563221|00000000||A letter… Turns out the Vildkaarls - unwitting tools. This druid, Artis, was to be the new king's advisor… Cheap reward for siccing the Vildkaarls on your guests, causing all that bloodshed.
    563222|00000000||Who signed it?
    584423|00000000||Nobody. Anonymous.
   1028147|00000000||Gods be with you, wanderer.
   1011913|00000000||Thank you, thank you for your help. Hemdall reward your sacrifice.
   1073562|00000000||Why? Wherein lies my crime?
   1073566|00000000||I merely want to prey, pay tribute to the gods. These scoundrels won't let me pass!
   1011036|00000000||Thank you, wanderer. I shall say a prayer for you at my pilgrimage's end.
   1013616|00000000||Nice gesture, thanks… Now, where's your pilgrimage taking you?
   1013618|00000000||To the Four Faces of Hemdall, raised in honor of our great hero.
   1011039|00000000||Farewell.
   1013687|00000000||So long. And stay out of trouble.
   1013685|00000000||I've heard the legends of Hemdall… A great warrior and first father of the Isles.
   1013788|00000000||Tis true, and before the advent of Tedd Deireadh, the Final Age, he shall return, walk amidst us, and face the evil powers, demons and specters of Chaos.
   1027988|00000000||The golden cockerel Kambi will crow to warn Hemdall of the coming of the Naglfar, bringing the army of darkness. A battle will ensue - Ragh nar Roog - and Hemdall will clash with the forces of the dark.
   1013819|00000000||Let's hope he wins…
   1013821|00000000||It'll make no difference. The prophecy is clear - after Ragh nar Roog, the world will end.
   1013823|00000000||Prophecies can be tricky that way. And there's never an ending that's not also a new beginning, a fresh start.
   1013825|00000000||Let us hope you're right, wanderer, let us hope you're right.
   1011038|00000000||Tell me about Hemdall.
   1011906|00000000||Greetings, wanderer. You're safe and sound, that's good to see.
   1013630|00000000||Hello. Still on your pilgrimage?
   1013632|00000000||Indeed. And by each of Hemdall's faces I pray the gods grant you grace.
    166703|2948fe35||Fisherman
    524210|00000000||Taken by surprise, but they fought off the attack… I need more clues. Search the perimeter?
   1021906|00000000||Tell me, lads, where you sailin' this time?
   1021908|00000000||Kerack. Sevald went there to sell furs. Said they've not got a full garrison.
   1021910|00000000||Oh, aye… Must've sent men 'gainst the Black Ones. Not expectin' anyone to strike from the sea.
   1021912|00000000||Then they're in for a surprise. And we're in for glory and riches!
    562678|87e5ea9d||Warrior
   1021678|00000000||I won! I won in the arena!
   1021683|00000000||Is that so? Who'd ye beat?
   1021685|00000000||Ulle the Unlucky.
   1054615|00000000||Fool! Every man beats Ulle. It's Ulle's destiny to lose, always!
   1054617|00000000||Come back when ye beat a real foe.
    506904|00000000||We've got it. We must return to the feast quickly, before…
    506905|00000000||Careful, now!
    508785|00000000||This is it!
    506935|00000000||Hold on tight!
    506933|00000000||Damn, I wanna kiss you, Yen.
    506934|00000000||We're gonna choke and die.
   1057955|00000000||The damned druid will poison us! This vapor's deadly, we've but a few minutes!
    506931|00000000||Teleport us outta here.
    506932|00000000||Think of something! Quickly! First thing to come to your mind!
   1032470|00000000||The best mead! I'll toast a whole barrel for a king like that!
   1032473|00000000||Tuirseach!
   1032476|00000000||I told ye Svanrige would show 'em!
   1032478|00000000||Just like Bran in his youth… To Bran!
   1032480|00000000||To Bran! Tuirseach!
   1047249|baa6fb37||Jesse
   1024067|00000000||And it hurts, horrible. As if… As if somethin' was tearin' me apart from inside.
   1024069|00000000||You should go see the druids.
   1024071|00000000||I been already. They said their herbs can't help, and all that's left is to pray.
   1024073|00000000||So have you?
   1024075|00000000||I prayed when Kjarre left me. When my mother fell ill. When the sheep were dyin'. I've no prayers left in me.
   1055104|7418226b||Clan Craite Warrior
   1070253|00000000||They could start, already.
   1049995|00000000||Thank ye, witcher!
    538568|ec216618||Innkeep
   1006022|00000000||Ye ain't welcome here, witch!
    580264|00000000||Accursed wench.
    589780|00000000||You'd best take that back.
    580255|00000000||Begone from the village, barren whore!
    580266|00000000||Woo-- Oh… What? What was that? A hex. Bitch hexed me!
   1006024|00000000||Ye defiled sacred ground! The gods'll never forgive you for this!
    580265|00000000||To go and defile the Garden of Freya, a hallowed place…
   1027713|00000000||Harpies treated him to a painful end.
    499599|00000000||Brr… Cold…
    595387|00000000||Uve? You all right, mate?
    595389|00000000||Oh, yeah… Won't get a peep outta you. Let's go.
   1001512|00000000||C'mon, men! Whosoever brings me Uve Jabberjaw's head will get a longship to command!
    594984|00000000||Long live Bran, Jarl of the Tuirseach, King of Skellige!
    594985|00000000||Long live the King!
    595375|00000000||Bran? It's not possible…
    595377|00000000||I see you're weary from the battle. Sit with me, son. Have some mead, pray tell of your adventures.
    595379|00000000||Thank you, my king. We--
    594989|00000000||I shan't drink with you, old man, and I shan't call you king. Get off that throne while you've still strength in your decrepit bones.
    595382|00000000||Uve?! You can talk?!
    595384|00000000||I… I didn't… But I…
    594991|00000000||You insult me once more, Uve Jabberjaw. The first time I left you to punish yourself and retain your honor. But now… now you will die like a thrall, and eels will eat your remains.
    585148|00000000||I was afraid you'd never talk to each other again. After that contest for the crown?
    585150|00000000||Who? Me and Hjalmar? You must be mad.
    585157|00000000||Rivalry certainly seemed serious.
    585159|00000000||Our rivalry's one thing, but we share the same blood - that's what really counts.
    585154|00000000||Not mad you lost?
    585161|00000000||So, not mad you lost?
    585163|00000000||Naturally I'd rather be standin' where he is now, but… my brother's strong, and he's got charisma. I believe folk'll follow him.
    585165|00000000||And if he grows too high and mighty, father'll cut him down to size, you can be sure o' that.
    585153|00000000||Farewell.
    585155|00000000||Give him my congratulations.
    585168|00000000||I will.
    426794|00000000||Keep my fingers crossed. Farewell.
    426790|00000000||Farewell.
    426688|00000000||What'll you do?
    426744|00000000||What's the new queen of Skellige planning?
    426752|00000000||Umm… To listen, learn and listen again. Then we'll see.
    426754|00000000||Good plan.
    426758|00000000||I must unite the clans. I'd rather avoid war, but if Nilfgaard aims to attack, we must repel them together.
    583716|00000000||Drummond folk might be a problem. I saw Lugos during the ceremony - furious, to say the least.
    583718|00000000||There's always been strife between our clans… But I must try and talk to him, just might bring him around.
    409165|00000000||Congratulations. You'll make a great queen.
    426624|00000000||Thank you. Wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
   1055665|718d5ea6||Ekhidna
    412531|00000000||Twere like this. Could hear the Black Ones' ship from afar…
    412533|00000000||Not surprisin'! They holler orders like the emperor hisself needs to hear and approve the course they're settin'!
    414751|00000000||We waited in ambush in a bay. Soon as they sailed by, we rammed our prow straight into their side!
    414753|00000000||Cuttin' 'em was tough, on account they were all clad in plate… so, we pushed 'em into the sea!
    414755|00000000||Sank faster than stones! Heheheh.
    593869|00000000||Wanna talk to Blueboy Lugos.
    593871|00000000||Hahaha… Hear that? He wants to talk to Lugos! What else, vagrant? Care to plough Freya?
   1001525|00000000||Nothing. Just wondering what you're doing… unless it's a secret.
   1001526|00000000||Secret? 'Tis a cause for pride! We sailed here under Blueboy Lugos to fight the monsters in the Cave of Dreams!
   1001527|00000000||Monsters, you say? You're in luck… Can I talk to Lugos? Maybe he cares to hire a professional.
   1001667|00000000||Where you goin', vagrant? No stranger's gonna stroll about our boat!
    593873|00000000||Outta my way.
   1001659|00000000||Get outta my way.
   1001661|00000000||Or what?
   1001662|00000000||Ugh, these conversations… Or I'll punch your teeth in.
    594009|00000000||Think you scare me - scare Jorulf, son of Odmar, known elsewise as the Wolverine?
    594011|00000000||Hey! What's all the hollerin'?
    594013|00000000||Some stranger wants on the longship. Says he's got business. But…
    594015|00000000||Let 'im pass. If he turns a nuisance we'll toss 'im overboard.
    594017|00000000||See you later, Jorulf, son of the Wolverine. Or whatever it was.
    595707|00000000||Never jest about my da. Never!
    593912|00000000||Works for me if you can arrange it.
    593914|00000000||I can arrange a knife 'tween your ribs as you sink to the bottom of the bay. Now bugger off.
    593916|00000000||Don't make me hurt you. Got enough trouble as it is.
    593872|00000000||Works for me if you can arrange it.
    593928|00000000||Lugos is expecting me. Lead the way.
    593930|00000000||R-r-right. Come on.
    593932|00000000||Why? I don't get it…
    593934|00000000||Then stay here, think it over.
    593910|00000000||Lugos is expecting me.
   1001674|00000000||Never mind… Good luck.
   1001668|00000000||Never mind.
   1001672|00000000||Whaddaya want?
   1051817|00000000||Simun Brambling sends his regards.
   1051596|00000000||Simun? Well, I never… Haggled Lugos hoarse tryin' to get 'im to hand ye over. Yet here ye come to me on your own.
   1051598|00000000||Nay. Not on me own.
   1051600|00000000||Don't know what the fuck you're on about, Simun… No matter. Time to get even. At long last.
    166476|00000000||Thanks, brother. I'll remember that.
    166481|00000000||Let's get out of here.
    166483|00000000||Right. Just as soon as I kill him.
   1024807|00000000||Verbena, lovage, chamomile!
   1024809|00000000||Chamomile, what's that for?
   1024811|00000000||Your stomach.
   1024813|00000000||And lovage?
   1024815|00000000||Love.
   1024817|00000000||Got anythin' for an itch? 'Cause I've had love aplenty of late, and now I've this horrible rash…
   1049201|00000000||…
   1049203|00000000||…!
   1049205|00000000||…!
   1024087|00000000||May I never flee the battlefield.
   1024089|00000000||May I not die poisoned or ensnared in a trap.
   1024091|00000000||May my sword drip red with the blood of Nilfgaard.
    491248|00000000||Hm, what is this? Woman's shawl… distinctive pattern… distinctive smell.
   1038386|00000000||Footprints, narrow… a woman's.
   1038388|00000000||Too many scents… Can't follow my nose any further. Need to ask around about the shawl.
   1050146|00000000||Gonna be honest with ye… I don't know how we'd 'ave managed without ye.
   1044280|00000000||You might've mentioned them when I walked in…
    587504|00000000||Need to take at least one alive.
    587506|00000000||Should at least take one alive, make him testify before--
    587508|00000000||This ain't the Continent, witcher. Don't need no court to see justice done.
   1069100|00000000||Stopped to consider that somebody might've duped them, used them?
   1069102|00000000||Then they'll die for bein' idiots. Enough jabberin', already. Let's go.
    587358|00000000||Nice and simple. Kind of plan I like.
    587361|00000000||And that's why I like you. Come on, Wolf. The skalds'll sing of our vengeance on the bears.
    587503|00000000||Simple plan. Kind I like.
    587497|00000000||So what now?
    587499|00000000||Simple. We welcomed the Vildkaarls under our roof, gave them food, drink… And they spilled our blood.
    587502|00000000||So now they must pay. In blood.
    587356|00000000||So what now?
    584791|00000000||Vildkaarls - what else do you know about 'em?
    584924|00000000||They're not part of any clan. They've no wives nor children.
    584926|00000000||So how do they reproduce? By budding?
    584928|00000000||No. Those wishin' to devote their lives to battle come here to join them.
    584930|00000000||In the summertime they hunt, go on raids. Come winter they sleep in caves… with the bears. Least that's what folk say.
    584932|00000000||Got a feeling it's more than gossip.
    584726|00000000||Vildkaarls - what do you know about them?
    584789|00000000||Why didn't you speak up right away?
    584793|00000000||Why not speak up right away? Back there, in front of everyone?
    584795|00000000||Cause they'd 'ave started talkin'. Questionin', quarrelin'.
    584797|00000000||Words won't wipe the shame from my clan. Only deeds will.
    587352|00000000||This is Fornhala. Their village.
    560038|00000000||They were the ones who changed into bears. Just like in the legends about berserkers. I saw it with my own eyes - might've been alone in that. Everyone else was starin' at young Lugos.
    588162|00000000||He claimed he could down a barrel of beer in one go. Almost did it, too.
    584112|00000000||Mhm. Tough to miss.
    560037|00000000||Right, we're here.
    584108|00000000||Meaning? Gonna explain what we're doing or not?
    584110|00000000||Remember the wild men I sparred with? The ones we called Vildkaarls?
    408219|00000000||Fuck me, powerful stench comin' from the hold.
    408221|00000000||Aye, we're victims of our own success. Best raid ever.
    408223|00000000||Success or no, gotta get those shiteaters out right quick, 'fore the stank settles in permanent-like.
    408225|00000000||Think I could have me a go?
    408227|00000000||Too late now. Got a buyer for the whole lot.
    408229|00000000||No one'll ever know…
    408231|00000000||Uggghhh…
    408233|00000000||What is it?
    408235|00000000||Whoreson bit me clean to the bone.
    408237|00000000||Ye should've put a blade 'tween his ribs, gotten it over with.
   1024096|00000000||Call that "premium goods"?! Fuckin' jest, that! These folk ain't but skin and bones.
    475482|00000000||Tarald of Lofoten entered the cave last spring. Hollered so loud they heard 'im in Kaer Trolde.
    475484|00000000||Might be he saw what awaited his village…
    475486|00000000||Anyone try those herbs?
    475488|00000000||Haha. Pave did. Then he climbed in a barrel, sprinkled salt on his head and said he was a herring.
    475490|00000000||They say come Ragh nar Roog every nightmarish creature man's ever dreamt will crawl outta the cave.
    475492|00000000||Me wife's mum marchin' at their head!
    475478|00000000||Jorulf said he'll man the helm the morrow.
    475480|00000000||Last thing we need…
    391116|00000000||Squid choke this life. Five times I went out. Came back with more seaweed than fish each time.
    391118|00000000||My catch? Hardly enough for supper… And here it's high time we started saltin' for winter.
    391120|00000000||When the eggs run low, they say the chickens've stopped layin'. What about fish?
    391122|00000000||Fish've done moved on.
    391130|00000000||A full half of Fayrlund perished fightin' the Black Ones.
    391132|00000000||At sea?
    391138|00000000||No, the imperials lay in ambush along the bay's shore. Struck as the Fayrlunders drew their longboats onto the beach.
    391140|00000000||Damn shame. Though at least they died in battle.
    347744|00000000||I can't take it anymore… Someone help me…
   1054152|54610db3||Hound of the Wild Hunt
   1050123|00000000||Turns out they spoke the truth about you.
    500729|00000000||Shall we put some coin on it, Lugos? Actually, dogshite idea - you never pay up.
    500728|00000000||No cheatin' now!
    500727|00000000||Show the little wench her place!
    500916|00000000||Start! May the best man win!
    587573|00000000||Could be they were working with someone.
    587588|00000000||Realize they might've acted at someone's behest? Might've just been part of a plot?
    587590|00000000||We an Craite have always had foes. Let them plot, let them strike. They'll end like the Vildkaarls.
    587592|00000000||Voices… More of 'em further on.
    587594|00000000||I'm countin' on it. Let's go!
    587586|00000000||Your vengeance, your rules.
    587572|00000000||Your vengeance, your rules.
    563193|00000000||Well, won't get anything else out of him.
    587571|00000000||We don't need to. Everything's clear, blood for blood.
    392717|00000000||Someone's comin'!
   1047379|00000000||Intruder neutralization commenced.
   1022253|00000000||Intruder detected.
   1030923|00000000||Cease your intrusion. Leave at once.
   1030925|00000000||Failure to leave when summoned.
   1027383|00000000||Free me, I beg o' ye.
   1027389|00000000||Why'd they chain you here?
   1027390|00000000||I didn't like ol' Gretter, no, but I didn't want his death. Free me, please. I was framed for murder.
   1027471|00000000||Hmm… Guess I believe you…
   1027472|00000000||Thanks. I won't forget this. I've no way to pay ye, but… We ever meet again, I'll get you back for what you done.
   1027607|00000000||Can you walk?
   1027609|00000000||Don't fret about me. I just need to rest a spell, then I'll be fine. Thank you for your help.
   1027377|00000000||I believe you. I'll free you.
   1027473|00000000||Yeah… All prisoners make that claim.
   1027474|00000000||No… Nay, don't go, please! Don't leave me! I beg ye, please don't leave me!
   1027378|00000000||I don't believe you. So long.
   1027384|00000000||You're back… Free me, please. I was framed, I speak true.
   1028055|00000000||Never mind me, just need a bit o' rest. I thank ye for your help.
   1049986|00000000||Mummy said you're a hero!
    578928|00000000||Had no respect for the law, your sons.
    578931|00000000||Your sons showed no respect for the law. If not for Jorund, something would've happened first time around…
    578934|00000000||There's a blodsfejd 'tween Jorund's family and mine. Makes no difference what he did or said.
    592730|00000000||Helped you. Killed the monster from the lighthouse.
    592736|00000000||I killed the monster from the lighthouse, the beast that haunted you. This how you repay me?
    592738|00000000||Paid you in gold. We owe you nothin' more.
    578935|00000000||Don't want any more bloodshed. But I'll defend myself if I have to.
    578949|00000000||You'll make your defense before the jarl. Only if Madman Lugos calls you innocent, will you be free to go.
    592744|00000000||I'm to be judged by somebody you yourselves call "Madman"?
    592746|00000000||That, or fight the whole village. And you'll never defeat us all, not with three swords you won't.
    592748|00000000||Fine. Lead the way.
    578929|00000000||You lie. You saw who started it, had to.
    578930|00000000||I'd sooner believe one of our own. Men who know what honor is.
    578927|00000000||You're lying.
    592706|00000000||Had but two sons. And you killed 'em. You ended my line.
    578915|00000000||Sorry. But I didn't start it.
    578916|00000000||Does this stranger speak the truth? Who first drew a blade?
    592710|00000000||Dunno. It happened fast, and we were a few horns in…
    171010|c51bb659||Pirate
   1050093|00000000||They'll sing ballads about ye! Thanks, Geralt!
   1021525|00000000||What is it? Got a mug like you just drank some rancid fish oil.
   1021527|00000000||Ynge kicked me out.
   1021529|00000000||Aaah… She find out about your little romps with Gista?
   1021531|00000000||Naye. She learned I'd refused to sail to Undvik with Hjalmar.
   1021533|00000000||Tossed me sword into the sea. Said a coward had no use for it.
    582884|00000000||Favored her from the start.
    582886|00000000||I'm glad he won. Brave and valiant, that one.
    582890|00000000||The kind of king we need!
    481362|00000000||I defeated ye!
   1043937|00000000||Seems so. Congratulations.
    503462|00000000||But… but how? I was to lose till the end o' time…
   1043939|00000000||What's that? I hear… I hear… laughter and joyous cries… the clanking of chalices… And a voice… summonin' me to the feast of heroes…
   1043941|00000000||You… Ye let me win… Ye freed me. Thank ye! The gods be with ye…
    503464|00000000||Farewell, ghost.
    481358|00000000||Well, you done it. Bravo. Be back again soon. So long.
    481359|00000000||Where you goin'? Don't ye want to defeat the Ghost of the Arena?
    575316|00000000||Huh, didn't win after all… Not so easy, eh? Maybe next time.
    583826|00000000||And if it's not enough for ye, these three victories… there's always the Great Race on Hindarsfjall. But winnin' there's a tall order.
    575311|00000000||Twas as ye said it would be. Ye won. Glory's yours… as is the prize.
    479168|00000000||Greetings… Can we talk?
    482211|00000000||I fought as much as anyone.
    482213|00000000||What was that?
    482215|00000000||Said I, Soren the Elder, fought as much as the rest. Only survived 'cause the blow missed me organs.
    482239|00000000||We're looking for a young woman. Ashen hair, green eyes… Was she here?
    482240|00000000||Our lads would return from the Continent with captive wenches. I took no interest in 'em. At my age one woman under me roof is too much already.
    482288|00000000||No… Ciri'd never let herself be taken.
    482290|00000000||Aww, you don't know our lads…
    482292|00000000||And you don't know Ciri.
    482216|00000000||We're looking for Ciri.
    482230|00000000||Farewell.
    482232|00000000||Freya watch over you.
    482218|00000000||Farewell.
    482217|00000000||Rather irritable, aren't you?
    482222|00000000||Little irritable, aren't you?
    482224|00000000||Who wouldn't be? Folk come from around and about to gape, see what's happened. All look at me cock-eyed, too.
    482234|00000000||"They didn't kill you?" "Buried three sons, but you're still alive?"
    482226|00000000||I explain and explain, but I'm weary on it. Next raid, I sail with the Larvik lads, show 'em what I'm made of.
    482236|00000000||Aren't you a little old for a raid?
    482238|00000000||Old? I'll never be too old to spill Nordling blood… or die an honorable death at their hands.
    482228|00000000||Well? What now?
   1043363|00000000||Ahh, perhaps 'twere written in the stars…
   1043361|00000000||Tove, Kvit, Hanne… They'd barely sprouted whiskers, yet in the ground they lie… And me - livin' and unharmed.
   1050121|00000000||Ain't nothin' quite like a witcher.
    517927|00000000||Don't blame yourself. Vigi wasn't exactly the predictable type. Soon as he was out, he could've run at the giant brandishing naught but his fists and his prick.
    517929|00000000||No tellin' what would've happened. Fight mighta not gone our way.
   1055068|00000000||Any glory stemming from the giant's death should be yours.
   1055072|00000000||"Hjalmar the Giantslayer" sounds better. It was your venture, you deserve the glory.
   1055074|00000000||Hm. Believe you're right.
    165093|00000000||Ready? Can we go?
    517960|00000000||Wanna look around.
    517967|00000000||Wanna look around some more.
    518298|00000000||In that case, I'll meet you on the beach, near the port.
    165097|00000000||Not just yet.
    165095|00000000||Let's go.
    517962|00000000||Let's go.
    517959|00000000||Let's go.
    517956|00000000||Let's get outta here.
   1055070|00000000||Sure sounds better than the Butcher of Blaviken. So be it.
   1055067|00000000||Thanks. So be it.
   1055064|00000000||Thanks for your help, White Wolf. Geralt the Giantslayer - I'll make sure the skalds set it in song.
    517922|00000000||Shouldn't blame yourself. We never knew with Vigi. Might've rushed at the giant bare-fisted soon as he was out.
    517924|00000000||And that might've spelled death for us all.
    517910|00000000||Vigi. Poor bugger.
    517912|00000000||Should've let him out.
    517931|00000000||Ha! I knew we'd best him!
    517952|00000000||Vigi… you daft bastard.
   1055091|00000000||Hahahaha!
   1055093|00000000||Hahahaha!
   1055095|00000000||Hahahaha!
    517934|00000000||Vigi… you daft bastard.
   1055087|00000000||Hahahaha!
   1055089|00000000||Hahahaha!
    517949|00000000||Heeeheheh ahhh… But where are the others?
    348752|00000000||Definitely won't get my coin back if I turn you in. But try to cheat me again, and I'll find you. I'll find you and I'll--
    348754|00000000||Nay, I ain't lyin'! Besides, you can go to the jarl any time you want.
    451441|00000000||Then I expect to see you later.
    393375|00000000||Won't turn you in.
    451925|00000000||Take care of you myself, you cheat.
    451927|00000000||I don't need a jarl to deal with you, you little crook.
    348756|00000000||Think you could fool me a second time? I'm gonna let the jarl decide what to do with you.
    348758|00000000||Force me to come with you - go ahead, try!
    393377|00000000||Jarl can decide what to do with you.
    348736|00000000||Most humbly beg your pardon, but I-I'm in quite a predicament, see. I'm a wandering juggler from occupied Temeria and--
    348738|00000000||Temeria? You sure? Not Novigrad?
    348740|00000000||Why-why Novigrad? I come from Maribor and, uh…
    348742|00000000||You're not cut out for this line of work - memory's too short. See, we've met, but you were a respected Novigrad merchant who wanted desperately to get home.
    348744|00000000||Oh, but-but I assure you I-- All right, all right, you got me.
    348746|00000000||I-I know this all looks bad, but I-I swear, I-I'll pay you back, mate. All of it, with interest! Just… please, don-don't take me to the jarl.
    509097|00000000||Greetings, White One.
    513831|00000000||I've not seen you here before. What do they call you?
    508184|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    508185|00000000||I'm Jutta an Dimun. No man's been found who could best me in combat.
    509156|00000000||I've heard of you. Word is you defeated Kolgrim and his men. They say the ground couldn't soak up the blood fast enough.
    509157|00000000||Just kinda turned out that way.
    509158|00000000||Modesty's a quality fit for priestesses and young lasses, not warriors. But I'll fight you nonetheless.
    509530|00000000||I've heard of you. 'Twas you defeated Olaf the Bear, right?
    509531|00000000||That's me.
    509532|00000000||If that's so, you'll make a worthy opponent.
    509744|00000000||Good, I'll give it a shot. See you soon.
    509745|00000000||I truly wonder if you will. Farewell!
    509742|00000000||If I'm to fight a witcher, I could use a fitting sword. At the sea's bottom, not far from shore, lies the wreck of Horned Hoskuld's longship…
   1022348|00000000||…And amidst the wreck lies Hoskuld's sword, which legend claims cannot be chipped. Bring it to me, and I'll fight you.
    509743|00000000||Hm… I'll fight you… if you defeat Gundar. Couldn't best me, but he's a brave man and a worthy opponent.
    509108|00000000||You? I've defeated Faroe's most famous warriors, men so worthy of respect I don't dare mention their names. And who is Geralt of Rivia?
    509109|00000000||Someone you haven't defeated.
    509110|00000000||Maybe you're not worthy of my time. You performed any great feats? 'Cause I don't believe I've heard…
    509111|00000000||What kind of feats you have in mind?
    509113|00000000||Will you fight me?
    508016|00000000||Will you fight me?
    509777|00000000||Got Hoskuld's sword like you wanted. Have yet to check if it really can't be chipped.
    509778|00000000||Well, well… How'd you manage it?
    509779|00000000||Didn't take much. Just a bit of holding my breath and swinging my arms and legs at the same time.
    509780|00000000||Hm, strong in the mouth. Let's see if you're as cocky in the ring.
    509746|00000000||I've got the sword you asked for.
    509596|00000000||Gladly fight you, but some other time.
    509599|00000000||Out of my sight.
    508017|00000000||Farewell.
    508021|00000000||I defeated Gundar.
    509533|00000000||I defeated Gundar.
    509534|00000000||Hm, thought you'd be no match for him. All right, we'll see how you fare against me.
    509564|00000000||Ready when you are.
    509565|00000000||Then let's start. May Freya choose the victor.
    508118|00000000||Let's fight.
    508119|00000000||Fight you some other time.
    509597|00000000||Don't know if you lack honor or knowledge of our customs, but you'll not fight me now or ever. You're no longer worthy…
    509598|00000000||But…
    592627|00000000||Transverse cut through the pelvis. Surgical precision. No conventional weapon could do this.
   1006957|00000000||But whatever cut the basket probably could.
    592629|00000000||Silver, pearl-encrusted cutlery… Ship belonged to someone awfully wealthy.
    592636|00000000||Amos was no pauper. It could very well be his ship.
    592621|00000000||No djinn here, but there's something you oughta like.
    592622|00000000||What?
    592623|00000000||Half a seal.
   1008260|00000000||That'll do. Come back up.
    592619|00000000||That is no meteorite crater…
   1008219|00000000||What is it, then?
   1008221|00000000||The effect of teleportation. A powerful force cut out a fragment of the sea bed, rocks and everything lying within the teleportation zone.
   1008223|00000000||Always claimed portals were dangerous.
    592620|00000000||I believe we're on the right track. Look for anything that might contain a djinn.
   1008235|00000000||Fine, but get outta my eyes. Too cramped in here for us both.
   1008186|00000000||Eys'u failte beydem aen eich'te llyvaid.
   1007944|00000000||Geralt, sirens!
   1006958|00000000||Bet it was cut by the same thing that cut the skeleton.
    592630|00000000||Hmm… Something cut this basket exactly in half.
    592611|00000000||Something strange about those rocks…
   1008089|00000000||And there's something on the bottom. I'll see what it is.
   1008140|00000000||See something?
    592616|00000000||"Something" doesn't do it justice. A huge crater, as if a meteorite landed here.
    592617|00000000||I must see it.
   1008144|00000000||Diving in after all?
    592618|00000000||No, I shall cast another spell. To see through your eyes. Now relax.
    170904|00000000||Yum! Yum!
    170906|00000000||Good 'uman, good soup.
    170908|00000000||Salty?
    170910|00000000||Salty.
    170912|00000000||Heheh, eyein' me is he.
    170914|00000000||Heheh, spyin' soup.
    158099|00000000||Ploughin' smash youse with a sledgehammer, as I'm Folan, son of Ulf! Your mothers'll be pickin' you up, pebble by fuckin' pebble!
    158103|00000000||Angry no! Angry bitter!
    158105|00000000||Splashing soup!
    506184|00000000||Bran was a great ruler.
    506186|00000000||He needs a worthy successor.
    506188|00000000||You speak as though you have someone in mind.
    506190|00000000||Skellige's troubles very much derive from it not being a hereditary monarchy. Any upstart can be king and destroy his predecessor's legacy.
    506194|00000000||The King of the Isles is a more symbolic position.
    506196|00000000||And that should change as well. A strong leader who wields true power - that is what the times require.
    515884|00000000||I'm Geralt. A witcher.
    515887|00000000||Birna. Queen of Skellige. I'm glad we've met, but you must forgive me. Duty calls.
    515883|00000000||I'm Geralt.
    515882|00000000||Introduce me, Yen?
    503768|00000000||Introduce me?
    503769|00000000||This is my friend Geralt, and this is Birna - widow of the dear departed Bran.
    503770|00000000||The Queen Mother. It's a pleasure to meet you, Geralt. You must forgive me, but on a day like today, I'm afraid I cannot indulge in my penchant for long conversations.
    355040|00000000||I can see you chose your own outfit. You know, of course, that together we look about as good as lace frills on a battle axe.
    358842|00000000||Everyone's got their style.
    354019|00000000||I'm not gonna drink. Why dull my senses when I'm in such pleasant company?
    358846|00000000||Do you plan to compliment me all evening?
    358848|00000000||I plan to tell you what I think.
    375955|00000000||We should mingle before they all get drunk. There'll be no talking to anyone then.
    375967|00000000||Good thinking. I don't know what Crach wants, but when we meet with him we should have clear minds.
   1034408|00000000||Let's find Crach.
   1034409|00000000||Really hate occasions like this.
   1034411|00000000||Ugh, don't like funerals, don't like feasts.
   1034413|00000000||I know. You also dislike underdone meat and being teleported. But sometimes we must overcome our disgusts and prevail.
    165626|00000000||Why am I not surprised? Oh, Geralt, Geralt - what is that you're wearing?
    165628|00000000||Didn't want to detract from your beauty.
    434251|00000000||A man at a woman's side is an accessory - he should enhance her beauty. But I thank you for the compliment.
    170991|00000000||Lovely outfit. You look… dashing.
    165634|00000000||Thank you. You're… dazzling.
    170993|00000000||You know I really missed your candidness. I'm glad we're here, together.
    503756|00000000||Lady Yennefer. So pleased you've come to pay your respects to my dead husband.
    503757|00000000||I knew Konung Bran well. His passing is the Isles' great loss.
    503758|00000000||It is… We must do all we can to minimize its tragic consequences.
   1086733|00000000||More, dammit, more!
    376337|00000000||What's that? A portal?
    376339|00000000||Two people emerged from it.
    480886|00000000||The woman was Ciri.
    480887|00000000||How can you know?
    480888|00000000||The way she moved. Like a witcher.
    503989|00000000||Seems they went that way.
    498767|00000000||Come, let's find the next spot.
   1008476|00000000||Seems Amos was quite the eccentric. Asking the djinn to lift half his ship to a mountaintop?
    582876|00000000||He didn't necessarily. Djinns are inherently mischievous, this one might've granted his wish and perverted it in doing so.
    582942|00000000||In that case, I'd appreciate it if you didn't wish I'd disappear from your life.
   1008480|00000000||I've yet to decide how to word it.
    593178|00000000||Looks like a laboratory.
    593179|00000000||Mage must've slept here.
    593299|00000000||"Elemental Empires" - by Gianbattista.
    593297|00000000||"Mystery of Mysteries" - Agnes of Glanville.
   1007709|00000000||Nice shoes. Looks like the impact with the mountain was so powerful, it popped the wearer right out of them.
   1007825|00000000||Cold's preserved the corpse… Hm… Died from head trauma, bookcase cracked his skull.
   1008488|00000000||Must've been a hard landing atop this mountain.
   1017711|00000000||Blood… Someone was dragged across the deck or left this mark when the ship suddenly tipped to one side.
   1041733|00000000||Intruder in tower. Aqueous countermeasures in effect.
    393062|00000000||Yes, an ordinary monster.
    393066|00000000||Mhm. I handle creatures like that, I know how. I can kill him for you, provided you have the coin.
    393068|00000000||Oh, don't you fret - we'll have the gold.
    393070|00000000||Just one small problem. The leshen's marked one of you. As long as that individual lives near its domain, the beast can't be killed, not completely. Sooner or later, it'll be reborn.
    393072|00000000||Must be one of the elders - Harald, I'm sure of it. You heard 'im.
    393074|00000000||Words aren't enough. Gotta find the mark my way.
    393076|00000000||Folk won't believe you. They'd never listen to an outsider accusing one of their own. But you find the marked one, and I'll handle the rest.
    393064|00000000||Not so ordinary. Monster like that's a serious threat to the village. And to me, if you decide to hire me.
    393060|00000000||Not so ordinary.
    393078|00000000||Went to look at the tracks in the woods. Spirit sure knows how to make an impression on intruders.
    393080|00000000||Told you - he likes killing.
    393056|00000000||Almost certain we're dealing with an old leshen.
    393058|00000000||An ordinary beast, then? Just as I said.
    312802|05e75e62||Harpy
   1073968|00000000||Calm down, you can do this. Now get back behind the torches.
   1022753|00000000||Do you know what I saw in the rushes the other day? A brant goose. With a red breast!
   1022755|00000000||Oh dear, that bodes ill! It might supplant native species.
   1022757|00000000||How did brants arrive here? Their hatcheries are far away, and we are not along their migratory path…
   1022767|00000000||Someone must have brought them from the Continent and they escaped. A moment of negligence and you've a tragedy in the making.
   1015741|00000000||Path of yours wasn't easy, but I managed to get to the end. Here's proof.
   1015742|00000000||First outlander to complete the trial. A feat worthy of respect.
   1054123|00000000||I'll make sure news of your deed spreads 'cross the five isles.
   1015738|00000000||Couldn't complete the trial.
   1015739|00000000||Just as I thought. A man not born in the Isles can't hope to meet our challenges. You can try again, but I doubt you'll manage…
   1054260|00000000||You did try, though. Glory to you for doin' that much.
   1015734|00000000||You bring news?
   1015735|00000000||Here's what I found.
   1015736|00000000||Couldn't get to the end.
    411752|00000000||What did you see in the beasts' innards?
    411754|00000000||The gods are not kind, Jarl. Our isles are in for hard times.
    420308|00000000||May your futures not be as black as they look!
    420316|00000000||Geralt, I need you to be sober.
    420314|00000000||Geralt, we should go now.
    420330|00000000||Hjort, it's back… the ache in my temples…
    420267|00000000||I'm not drinking.
    420289|00000000||A worthy gesture, Udalryk, but I need to keep my head clear today. Got an important conversation later.
    413111|00000000||Strange man.
    413113|00000000||I hear he's very sick. Carrying himself unusually well tonight.
    420332|00000000||We'll leave you alone.
    420326|00000000||Hjort, the pain returns to my head. Once again, it starts.
    420293|00000000||To Bran.
    420265|00000000||I'll drink.
    420287|00000000||A toast, to honor King Bran's memory.
    413109|00000000||Nice to meet you both.
    413107|00000000||Was nice meeting you.
    435362|00000000||Thanks for the prediction.
    435364|00000000||You do not believe now, but you will yet remember my words.
    435348|00000000||Thanks for the prediction.
    435346|00000000||Doubt it.
    435350|00000000||Didn't plan to visit Spikeroog.
    435352|00000000||Man is not the master of his fate.
    413059|00000000||Gotta say, never really believed in omens and auguries.
    413061|00000000||One's belief or lack thereof - makes no difference.
    413065|00000000||Tell him what awaits him. What you told me.
    435336|00000000||Your fates will intertwine - yours and Udalryk's. You will walk in darkness. Before you - fire and shadow.
    435338|00000000||Hear that, Geralt? Everything clear now?
    413015|00000000||Don't generally believe in omens.
    413017|00000000||What's in store for Yennefer and me?
    413087|00000000||If you don't mind, Yen, I'd like to ask about us. What's the future hold in store?
    413089|00000000||The one you seek you will find, and then she will die.
    413091|00000000||So I won't meet a tall dark stranger? I shall have to content myself with you, Geralt.
    413093|00000000||I sense the mockery in your voice, my lady. But my omens do not lie.
    412396|00000000||I present to you Geralt of Rivia. Geralt… This is Udalryk, jarl of the Brokvar clan, from Spikeroog, and his advisor, Hjort.
    413013|00000000||The White Wolf.
    412398|00000000||Greetings.
    412392|00000000||What's that mean - "The isles are in for hard times"? Speak clear.
    413007|00000000||The heart was deformed. An ill omen always.
    413009|00000000||An ill omen for me as well? Hear me? What'll become of me?
    413011|00000000||Fear not, Jarl. I'll not let you perish, I assure you. You need only follow my council.
   1071127|00000000||Argh, fuck a king like that.
    431950|00000000||A damn good turn, that!
    479153|00000000||Greetings. Can we ask you something?
    482354|00000000||…
    482356|00000000||Excuse me… Can we ask you…
    482358|00000000||You can.
    482362|00000000||Were you here when the Hunt attacked?
    482369|00000000||Were you here when the Hunt attacked the village?
    482371|00000000||Why do you care?
    482373|00000000||We're following their trail. Anything you can…
    482375|00000000||Hahaahaa!
    482377|00000000||Hear that, Gimri? And they say I've gone mad…
    482361|00000000||We're looking for Ciri.
    482379|00000000||We're looking for a young woman. Ashen hair, green eyes. Seen her?
    482381|00000000||No.
    482383|00000000||Try to remember. This is important to us.
    482385|00000000||Ain't to me.
    482387|00000000||Ain't nothin' important to me. They destroyed it. They destroyed it all.
    482363|00000000||Farewell.
    482365|00000000||Farewell.
    482367|00000000||Mhm.
    482360|00000000||Leave me be.
    595467|00000000||Who's the better warrior now?! Who?! Ptooey!
    595468|00000000||Lugos, leave 'im. 'Tis only  a vision, true… but it's not proper.
    595441|00000000||Quiet, calm… Suspicious.
    595442|00000000||Must be my dream. I don't fear nothin'!
    595462|00000000||You fear nothin', boy? You? You pissed your trousers when lightnin' struck the tree by our home!
    595463|00000000||I was three years old. I've shown a hundred times since then that I--
    595464|00000000||You pissed yourself. Before the whole village. The jarl's son. Argh, the shame. Shoulda banished you.
    595465|00000000||You're a vision! A specter!
    595466|00000000||A vision of your da… Who you fear. 'Cause you know you don't live up to 'im. You know you disappoint 'im.
    595697|00000000||I'm a better warrior than he ever was.
    595699|00000000||Prove it, ye little shite.
    586955|00000000||Anybody see how the bears got in?
    586989|00000000||Anybody see how the bears got in?
    586992|00000000||Don't matter. I know where to find the guilty already.
    587056|00000000||I'll stay here. Someone must see to everything - summon the healer, hand the fallen over to their families.
    587058|00000000||Wolf… I thank you.
    587027|00000000||Going with Hjalmar.
    587047|00000000||I'm going with Hjalmar. Don't know where, but I'm going.
    587049|00000000||Knew you'd not turn down an adventure!
    587042|00000000||You're right, Cerys. I'll help you.
    587053|00000000||Thanks.
    587045|00000000||Fine. See you when I return with the traitors' heads.
    587026|00000000||I'll help you, Cerys.
    587033|00000000||Pretty sure you can handle this fine without me.
    587035|00000000||Aye, we will. So long, Wolf.
    587028|00000000||You two can handle this fine without me.
    587013|00000000||Wait! Are you mad? You're gonna kill folk before we've learned what happened?
    587015|00000000||Learn all you want. Meantime, I'll go wash the shame off our clan.
    587017|00000000||Hey! The jarls aren't listenin' anymore! Stop playin' the hero and think for a second!
    587019|00000000||Our honor's at stake, sis. That can't wait.
    587021|00000000||Are you listening to me? Someone let those bears in. We must know who, and the answer lies somewhere in this room!
    587002|00000000||Dammit! Things've sure gotten messy.
    587003|00000000||That's putting it mildly. We've clues to examine, things to consider. We must find out how this came to be, elsewise we--
    587010|00000000||We've no time for that. I know where to find the guilty.
    586954|00000000||Damn. Got ourselves a right mess.
    586959|00000000||Cloth! Gimme some cloth! Gotta stop the bleedin'! Quick!
    586961|00000000||Da… Da…
    586963|00000000||Take my cloak.
    586966|00000000||Hold on, son, you'll pull through. A shark grabbed my leg once… Halbjorn?
    586968|00000000||He's dead.
    586970|00000000||Raaaaaaaaah!
    586972|00000000||Crach! Where'd those bears come from?! Heh?! Answer! Now!
    586975|00000000||Careful how you speak to my da!
    586978|00000000||Stow your blade, pup. Or Crach'll lose a son, too!
    586980|00000000||You insult me, Lugos. And now you threaten my son. I will not stand for this.
    586982|00000000||Then come here! C'mon! Put you down like a rabid dog!
    586984|00000000||Calm down! Calm down! Enough blood's been spilt!
    586986|00000000||Someone brought these beasts here to murder our sons and brothers. We cannot restore their lives.
    587060|00000000||But we can, we must, avenge them. This burden falls upon the host - and his offspring.
    586988|00000000||Find the guilty, an Craite. Find and kill them. Else your clan will be cursed for a hundred generations to come.
   1086646|f3f77a98||Clan Heymaey Guard
    455647|00000000||An old shrine… covered in runes.
    584147|00000000||I know the signs. Language of our forefathers.
    584151|00000000||"Svalblod." Dammit…
    584962|00000000||What is it? That a name?
    584964|00000000||Aye. A deity whose worship is banned. All altars devoted to him were razed years ago… Priests extollin' him were bound, tossed into sailless longboats that were pushed out to sea.
    584966|00000000||Why'd you turn against Svalblod?
    584972|00000000||What'd this deity do to earn condemnation?
    584974|00000000||Him? Nothin'. But those who promised him almost drowned Skellige in blood.
    417964|00000000||*Sniffs* Strange smell. Bit like incense… Bit like a bait we witchers use.
    418245|00000000||For what?
    584173|00000000||Bears.
    587218|00000000||Crikey, you've a sniffer like a hound's.
    587219|00000000||Better. Follow me.
    584976|00000000||You see… Svalblod demands sacrifices. Human sacrifices.
    584978|00000000||Sword at the ready, witcher.
    584968|00000000||Doesn't make sense to fear the gods. Only ever dangerous in stories.
    584970|00000000||The gods don't concern me… Their followers do.
    584965|00000000||No need to fear the gods.
    481285|00000000||Draw your weapon.
    481286|00000000||Drawin', drawin'. But make it quick. And not too much drama, if ye don't mind.
    481282|00000000||Draw your weapon.
    481289|00000000||Not gonna be any fight.
    481290|00000000||Have it your way. If not you, then the one to come after. 'Tis all the same to me.
    481284|00000000||Not about to fight you.
   1044720|00000000||You seem bored.
   1044722|00000000||You're no typical wraith…
   1044724|00000000||Why not? 'Cause I don't shriek threats and warn ye of your death? Well, that's simple enough - plain bored o' that.
   1044728|00000000||Sides, I know how it'll be: you'll spit out some insults, pierce me with your sword. I'll then disappear, only to be back again in a few days.
   1044730|00000000||And it'll be so with those who come after ye. Such is me fate - I'm to tarry here till the world's end, losin' every fight along the way.
   1044732|00000000||But you've not come to chat. Draw it, swing it, get to work and defeat the Ghost of the Arena.
   1044719|00000000||Just spare me your jabber, your cries of "Die, wraith!" and "I shall defeat ye, Specter o' the Arena!" I've heard 'em all a thousand times. Dreadful sick of 'em.
    481281|00000000||Come to face the Ghost of the Arena? Don't be shy - all defeat Ulle the Unlucky.
    388549|00000000||I solve problems.
    388557|00000000||I solve problems. And if we can agree terms, I can solve yours.
    388559|00000000||He's a witcher, a killer for hire.
    506160|00000000||Just passing through, looking for work.
    394196|00000000||I've heard enough. You've got a monster problem, that's clear. Just not sure you want it solved.
    394198|00000000||Oh, we do. Come see me. We'll figure us a fair price for the beast's head.
    385870|00000000||Our little talk while I looked over the corpse - not nearly enough. Need to look around, figure out what I'm up against.
    386222|00000000||Be not rash, killer. It's not too late to bring back the old ways.
    388884|00000000||I'll decide what to do. But start collecting coin, just in case.
    385852|00000000||Enough.
    386748|00000000||You said the creature wants revenge. Why? For what?
    386750|00000000||Our forefathers hunted with spear and knife. This pleased the Woodland Spirit. He let us live in peace. We never knew hunger.
    386801|00000000||He killed back then, too, he's always killed. How many lads died trying to become hunters? Now, since our hunters died in the war, the beast's turned even more bloodthirsty.
    386879|00000000||We are an Craite! What others buy with gold, we buy with our lifeblood.
    386881|00000000||We are slaves to fear spread by blind fools like you. These woods are ours. High time we put an end to this beast.
    386746|00000000||Why is the Spirit out for revenge?
    388651|00000000||Exhaustive as descriptions go. What does this Spirit look like? Anyone seen it for themselves?
    388653|00000000||No man alive has.
    394204|00000000||Great. Really helpful, all of you.
    385854|00000000||Who or what is this Woodland Spirit?
    385858|00000000||Tell you what it's not - any of your concern.
    386679|00000000||It's a common beast. Murders any man who ventures into its territory.
    385848|00000000||Who is this Woodland Spirit?
    385850|00000000||What did the other victims' bodies look like?
    386733|00000000||Birds pecked apart his entrails… And here - tooth marks - a large dog, a wolf maybe. This the way it always kills?
    386738|00000000||Only cowards. True warriors, men with the hearts of predators - the Spirit grants them an honorable death.
    394162|00000000||This village is home to decent folk only. You won't find any work here.
    388647|00000000||Sure about that? Beast that did this - it's aggressive and incredibly strong. I can help you. For a price.
    391769|00000000||I like this man. Ply your trade, witcher. I believe we will agree terms.
    506156|00000000||Saw your notice.
    506159|00000000||What notice?
    388551|00000000||Geralt. I'm a witcher.
    388553|00000000||A killer for hire? What do you seek here?
    388547|00000000||Geralt, a witcher.
    385840|00000000||We've offended him, Sven. The Woodland Spirit seeks revenge. This here is him saying we've strayed from the old paths.
    386528|00000000||Offended him? The monster's killed five already. He doesn't give a rat's arse about paths or tracks or me or you. He's a ploughin' beast from the ploughin' forest.
    388545|00000000||Split his ribcage. A strong one, this spirit of yours.
    386520|00000000||That so? And who might you be?
    388866|00000000||The leshen's chosen the girl... Dammit.
    491823|00000000||Not like that. Keep your elbow up, or your arrow'll go astray.
    491824|00000000||I know… But me arm hurts.
    491825|00000000||Good. Means your muscles are workin'.
    497697|00000000||And mind the string don't catch on your nose.
    498096|00000000||Pa… I know!
    491862|00000000||Storm's a-comin'. Gotta go to your mum, tell her to take the wash down… You keep practicin'.
    491863|00000000||Aye.
    497701|00000000||If your fingers tire, grip the string with…
    497703|00000000||No need. They won't tire.
   1072675|00000000||Follow me, please.
    586682|00000000||How's the mood in there?
    328865|00000000||Calm. Too calm!
    588357|00000000||How's that?
    588359|00000000||We've an adage here in Skellige… At a good feast, mead and blood flow in equal measure.
    583660|00000000||Surely you'd consider this barbaric on the Continent, no?
    347575|00000000||Not sure. Sounds preferable to dull banquets garnished with court intrigue.
   1054063|00000000||Old castle's haunted, methinks…
   1054065|00000000||Saw flashes 'midst the ruins th'other day!
   1054067|00000000||And heard screams and poundin'!
   1054069|00000000||Ye got pissed on mead! 'Twas your own thick skull poundin'!
    557168|00000000||Agaaaaaiiiin.
    557172|00000000||Buyin' or leavin'?
    557170|00000000||Pshaw.
    557174|00000000||Purse as empty as his ballsack.
    557184|00000000||*Sigh* Ehhhh.
    557176|00000000||Wild Hunt take you!
    557178|00000000||Wait a minute. Is this a robbery?
    557180|00000000||Freya, help!
    557182|00000000||You touch it, you buy it.
    557186|00000000||You want everythin' half-price.
    563204|00000000||Gratis?!
    563211|00000000||Gratis I can kick ye outta the inn, an axe 'tween your shoulders!
   1017725|00000000||We beat the djinn.
   1017804|00000000||We've improved. Last time we tamed a djinn we destroyed half of Rinde.
   1017806|00000000||Yes, we make a good team.
   1018227|00000000||If I'd known what this was about, I'd have refused.
   1008928|00000000||Not sure I'd have done it if I'd known what this was about from the start.
   1008930|00000000||Then we'd never have learned the truth… Whether anything would change after the djinn removed the spell.
   1018239|00000000||Has it? Has anything changed?
   1018420|00000000||What now?
   1018461|00000000||What's next? Got any plans?
   1018463|00000000||That depends what you mean… We must find Ciri, and then defeat the Hunt…
   1007229|00000000||Sorry, but I don't want to be with you anymore.
   1007277|00000000||Sorry, Yen. But… magic's gone for me.
   1018380|00000000||Truly?
   1018382|00000000||But… how is that possible? I still feel the same, you should too, I don't understand… What does this mean?
   1018384|00000000||Means the djinn granted your wish…
   1007278|00000000||Right. Fine. Good. Glad we've got that over with. We know where we stand, at least.
   1007279|00000000||Naught left for us here, let's go.
   1018389|00000000||Wait.
   1018392|00000000||Magic's gone, true, but that doesn't mean I don't like spending time with you.
   1018394|00000000||Let's sit a while.
   1018453|00000000||But… I doubt the world will end if we sit here a while.
   1018456|00000000||Ahh… My, it's lovely.
   1018458|00000000||Mhm. Think the spirits of Skellige favor us.
   1009004|00000000||Maybe we oughta test a few other things? Amos' cabin looked cozy…
   1007281|00000000||Not so fast, Geralt. We'll have plenty of time to visit cozy cabins later.
   1018419|00000000||Let's not end on a kiss.
   1022543|00000000||Ow! What was that?
   1022545|00000000||It can't all be sweetness and light.
   1018415|00000000||Strange… Done that so many times, but… it felt like our first kiss to me.
   1018417|00000000||It was, in a way. Besides… once you say "I love you," a kiss has to taste differently.
   1007230|00000000||Djinn mighta cheated us after all…
   1007231|00000000||Why?
   1008957|00000000||Cause I don't feel that anything's changed, either.
   1022538|00000000||I love you, Yen.
   1022540|00000000||And I love you.
   1007228|00000000||I still love you, too.
   1008940|00000000||Hmm… I expected… I don't know what I expected, actually. A bit of vertigo, perhaps.
   1008942|00000000||I thought… you'd become a stranger to me… That I'd look at you and not feel a thing…
   1008945|00000000||But it's not like that at all. Nothing's changed.
   1018226|00000000||Well, never could say no to you.
   1018232|00000000||Mhm… perhaps that will change now.
   1018234|00000000||Feel anything? That anything's… different?
   1018225|00000000||Couldn't have refused.
   1018224|00000000||Thank you for coming, Geralt. I'd have had a much harder time of it on my own.
   1017736|00000000||Feel any better?
   1017738|00000000||I told you, I'm fine.
   1017740|00000000||Don't need to play tough for me. That was a hard fight. Maybe not as hard as the last time we tamed a djinn, but still…
   1017775|00000000||Hmh! No comparison, I'm afraid. Half of Rinde suffered then. Now I'm merely a bit tired…
   1017724|00000000||Bit better now?
   1017706|00000000||Storm's over.
   1007214|00000000||Yes. It's all over.
   1017720|00000000||Maybe we should sit? You look a bit dazed…
   1017722|00000000||I'm not. But we can sit.
   1008908|00000000||Got you!
   1008910|00000000||Your master died before uttering his last wish! I cannot capture you!
   1008912|00000000||We can struggle like this for eternity, or I can release you! If you do one thing for me!
   1008914|00000000||Grraghh!
   1008916|00000000||Do you see the spell that binds us?
   1008918|00000000||Graug!
   1008920|00000000||Only a djinn can remove another djinn's spell! Remove this one, and you'll be free!
   1007213|00000000||Aaauuutree neyyyvanaaaath!
   1017586|00000000||You are free!
   1018400|00000000||We should get back.
   1018403|00000000||I'll take us to Kaer Trolde.
   1070867|00000000||Fang marks, claw marks, broken bones… Hard to say what exactly killed him.
   1070869|00000000||So many wounds… No wonder Hjalborn bled to death.
   1070871|00000000||Young Lugos… Bears took him by surprise. Didn't have a chance to defend himself.
   1070873|00000000||Drogodar… Skald's played his last.
   1070877|00000000||Body's massacred. Hard to tell who it is… Steingrim, maybe?
   1070875|00000000||Otrygg… Shit, no more'n a kid.
    174153|49292af3||Cyclops
    392478|00000000||A leshen. Male - very old.
   1074003|00000000||Dammit. Probably marked one of the villagers.
    583699|00000000||Then bring on someone sober. Think you can find one?
    583701|00000000||I can. Night's still young.
    425873|00000000||Gladly fight someone sober.
    410026|00000000||Ye fell so quick I didn't even have the time to warm up…
    583703|00000000||Had a drink? Don't fight.
    425875|00000000||Your problem. Bye.
    410024|00000000||You'd never 'ave beat me if I weren't five tankards in.
    501013|00000000||Something happened on that trip.
    501027|00000000||Got a feeling this trip didn't end happily…
    501029|00000000||Your feeling's right. There was an accident.
    495292|00000000||So? D'you find the sword?
    501125|00000000||Thanks for your help, Geralt, but I've gotta get the sword.
    350489|00000000||Out of the question. I'll get it.
    350491|00000000||Really? Thanks. So I can go see Udalryk.
    495289|00000000||No chance. You're weak. Might pass out again along the way. Wait here, we'll go together.
    435211|00000000||Not yet. Wait for me.
    433676|00000000||No, wait here.
    433674|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
    495294|00000000||I found it. Let's go.
    495456|00000000||After you, then.
    435209|00000000||Let's go see Udalryk. Be interesting to see if there actually is a ghost in all this.
    501166|00000000||Besides, now we've got the sword, we'll soon see if that's what it's about.
    501168|00000000||Hmm, no harm in trying, I suppose.
   1064473|00000000||So you believe Aki's getting his revenge. 'Cause Udalryk let him die?
   1064475|00000000||I've talked to Hjort. He swears Udalryk didn't start hearin' voices till after Aki's death. And I don't think Hjort's mistaken, he knew both those boys from the cradle.
    501111|00000000||I think we've to give Brokvar to Aki, and he'll leave Udalryk alone.
    501116|00000000||Not a bad idea - on condition it's a ghost we're dealing with. But something doesn't add up…
    501119|00000000||What's that?
    501120|00000000||Aki drowned at sea - said so yourself. But the ghost haunts this house.
    501124|00000000||Aki and Udalryk both lived here. Maybe that's why.
    487787|00000000||Think Aki wants revenge against Udalryk?
    487788|00000000||Where'd you get that idea?
    487793|00000000||Daring theory… Not breaking any of your laws just by thinking it?
    501063|00000000||Don't care. I don't believe it's the gods talkin'. Have you seen him? He's covered in scars.
    487809|00000000||Thought he earned those in battle.
    487812|00000000||If you call the strife in his heart and head a battle…
    487813|00000000||I asked him about it. He said the voices command him to hurt himself - for the glory of the gods.
   1064471|00000000||I think not. It's not the gods, it's Aki.
    487778|00000000||The brother's ghost?
    487780|00000000||Long as I remember, folk've said Udalryk's the chosen one, the one the gods speak to.
    487782|00000000||I believed it once, but now, considerin' certain things… I think he's just haunted, and it's his dead brother that's hauntin' him.
    489392|00000000||What'd you plan to do with the sword?
    489398|00000000||I thought Aki's ghost would want it back…
    350010|00000000||What do you want the sword for?
    349994|00000000||Think Udalryk killed his brother?
    350006|00000000||What do you think? Did Udalryk kill Aki?
    350008|00000000||I don't want to jump to any conclusions. But I do think whatever happened at sea that day, well, it's affecting Udalryk right now, powerfully so.
    489384|00000000||And it could have somethin' to do with that sword.
    501016|00000000||A storm broke out and Aki fell overboard. Udalryk had his hands full with the sails. Didn't hear his brother until it was too late.
    501017|00000000||Didn't hear… or didn't want to hear…
    501018|00000000||Some folk on the isle had the same doubt, but none would mention it aloud.
    501020|00000000||Most likely their father thought some hard work at sea together would fix things between them…
    501021|00000000||We use sea outings as cures for many things… Sadly, this time it didn't work.
    501012|00000000||They make friends?
    487466|00000000||They chained Udalryk to a pile, up to his waist in the sea. Spent three days like that. When his punishment ended, he and Aki sailed out to fish.
    500981|00000000||Serious enough for Udalryk to break a sacred law here in Skellige - he openly questioned his father's decision.
   1064469|00000000||Guessing the old jarl couldn't let it pass?
    349954|00000000||So what's this sword all about?
    349962|00000000||It's Brokvar, the ancestral sword of Udalryk's clan. I need it to lift the curse that holds Udalryk.
   1063668|00000000||A curse?
   1063665|00000000||Long story. Years ago Udalryk and his little brother butted heads over the sword.
    500973|00000000||As custom has it, the clan sword should go to the firstborn son - Udalryk. But his father gave Brokvar to his little brother - Aki.
    500980|00000000||Huh, serious insult in these lands.
    350096|00000000||What's so important about this sword?
    350092|00000000||Why'd you go in the house?
    487431|00000000||Why'd you go in there?
    487435|00000000||I wanted to help Udalryk…
    487436|00000000||Sure, he was acting strangely, but I don't see how your stroll through a haunted house will help him.
    487438|00000000||It would've, if I'd only found the sword.
    500892|00000000||You're not going anywhere. I carried you out of there a moment ago, half dead.
    500895|00000000||I have to--
    500903|00000000||You have to tell me what's going on.
    487595|00000000||For a sword? Mean this one?
    487598|00000000||You have it?! Then what're we waiting for? We've got to see Udalryk!
    349908|00000000||Wha-- What happened? Where am I?
    495212|00000000||Oooo… My head - pain's just awful…
    495213|00000000||Got hit, with something heavy.
    430793|00000000||Geralt… Why're you here?
    349910|00000000||Came to look for you. Crach's worried.
   1072846|00000000||Taking you home.
   1072848|00000000||I won't go until I help Udalryk.
    349912|00000000||The sword! Where's the sword?! I've gotta go back!
    501159|00000000||So Hjort also doubts Udalryk's been chosen by the gods.
    501161|00000000||He's loyal to the clan, so he'd never say openly. But he suggested that Udalryk's troubles likely come from Aki.
    501157|00000000||Hjort has doubts as well?
    501164|00000000||Hmm… So you think it might be Aki's ghost, not the gods?
    501158|00000000||Think it might be Aki's ghost?
    501149|00000000||I take it your suspicions were confirmed.
    501152|00000000||Priestesses and druids wouldn't say much. But they agreed there's not much in the holy tomes about the gods commandin' folk to hurt themselves.
    501156|00000000||Hjort was the one really got me thinkin'. He told me Udalryk started hearin' voices right after Aki's death. Hjort thought that important.
    501082|00000000||What've you learned?
    501083|00000000||What do you know about Hjort?
    501096|00000000||This Hjort… Who is he, exactly?
    501097|00000000||A druid. Been servin' the Brokvar clan since Agnar, Udalryk's granddad, was jarl.
    501100|00000000||Da says he's the only reasonable man in the whole clan.
    501144|00000000||Crach could be right. Seems Hjort gave you a good lead.
    487792|00000000||And you have a theory about the voices, what they might actually be…
    501070|00000000||I've asked around, here and there, visited our druids on Ard Skellig and Freya's priestesses on Hindarsfjall. And I've talked to Hjort.
    500962|00000000||What else would Skellige boys fight about?
    500959|00000000||Good reason to fight.
    500968|00000000||Let me guess. The sword was supposed to go to the first-born, but their father decided it would be the younger brother's?
    500976|00000000||You know our customs well.
    500977|00000000||Well enough to know Udalryk probably considered that a serious insult.
    500960|00000000||Lemme guess.
    502212|00000000||Hm, seems Udalryk was very brave when young…
    502214|00000000||Or very foolish…
    502209|00000000||Brave guy.
    502210|00000000||Was Udalryk punished?
   1025494|00000000||See you're not from 'round here. What's brought ye to Spikeroog?
   1053500|00000000||Treacherous, those caves. Folk used to make sacrifices to Melusine there.
   1053502|00000000||So Britt spoke the truth. An ekhidna nabbed her Nils.
   1042452|00000000||You tell her.
   1053494|00000000||You should talk to her. She'll need her brother's support.
   1053496|00000000||Ahh… Ehh, never got on too well with her. But you're right - I oughta do this.
   1025513|00000000||Farewell.
   1053473|00000000||We'll talk later.
   1025486|00000000||Farewell.
   1053510|00000000||Feel like a damned fool, now, not believin' me own sis.
   1053968|00000000||Take this - hard work deserves payment.
   1042454|00000000||Fine, I'll talk to her. It's the least she deserves.
   1042451|00000000||Fine, I'll tell her.
   1042450|00000000||Witcher, would ye mind tellin' Britt what happened to her betrothed?
   1053504|00000000||So Britt spoke true! A beast took Nils!
   1053506|00000000||And killed him. Body's in the cave.
   1053508|00000000||I'll have to fetch it.
   1053498|00000000||Found an old ekhidna in a cave on the shore. Tough beast, but I killed it.
   1025485|00000000||Got rid of the beast.
   1053484|00000000||Your sister's story - got the impression you don't believe it.
   1053486|00000000||Sensing you just don't believe your sister.
   1053488|00000000||They had their ups, they had their downs. Nils - thoroughbred skirt-chaser, and Britt's just not easy to be around.
   1053492|00000000||But family's sacred. Ye willin' to look into this?
   1042202|00000000||I'll see what I can do. Wanna talk to your sister, first off.
   1042204|00000000||Britt and Nils had their favorite spot - cliffs north of the village. Ever since he went missin', she's been wanderin' about there.
   1042206|00000000||Thanks, I'll go see her.
   1053512|00000000||Changed my mind.
   1042171|00000000||Fine, I'll take the job.
   1042183|00000000||Sorry, don't have time for this now.
   1042173|00000000||Don't have time for this.
   1042172|00000000||Reward's too small.
   1042175|00000000||Finding Nils won't be easy. Reward you posted's not enough.
   1047676|00000000||Bring him home, and I'll spare no coin.
   1047678|00000000||Need to hear something specific - a sum.
   1047680|00000000||First you gotta tell me somethin' specific - what happened to Nils.
   1071486|00000000||Have the gods forsaken ye?! I could get a whole village to do the searchin' for that!
   1071488|00000000||Well, now… Dunno… Would ye consider droppin' it a bit?
   1071492|00000000||Bloody fuckin' hell, enough! Take what I'm offerin' or piss off!
   1071490|00000000||Agreed.
   1053472|00000000||Read your notice.
   1025501|00000000||Heard you've got a job for a witcher.
   1053475|00000000||Aye, me sis's near drilled a hole in me gut, pesterin' me. I hung a notice, hopin' she'd let up.
   1053966|00000000||Truth be told, didn't really expect anyone to take an interest.
   1053477|00000000||What's this about?
   1053479|00000000||Me sister's betrothed - he's disappeared. Folk say he done a runner. Sis claims she saw a beast carry him off.
   1025520|00000000||Master witcher!
   1025525|00000000||Well, then? Have any luck?
   1053514|00000000||Thanks again for your help, witcher!
    170811|72cb8ee5||Drowner
   1055115|f9a4a6f0||Skelliger
   1054657|00000000||Jorund!
   1074101|00000000||I pray the beasts don't come back. Stink worse than kayrabs, they do.
   1022433|00000000||A Nilf goes down, pass 'im around, ninety-nine black-plated beasts on the boat!
   1022435|00000000||Whoa, there, Volund, don't wanna be pukin' again, do we…?
   1064283|00000000||You and my da - you were mates once, right?
   1064285|00000000||Hope we still are.
   1064287|00000000||But… Well I heard you fell out over somethin'… or someone…
   1064448|00000000||Talking about that story with Yennefer?
   1064450|00000000||Long time ago, that. In fact, that was before Crach met the woman who'd be your mother.
   1064455|00000000||But you and Yennefer'd already met?
   1064457|00000000||Err, things were never cut-and-dried with Yen.
   1064461|00000000||What is it about her? What is it that draws you?
   1064463|00000000||Dunno… Maybe, uh, it's 'cause I've never chosen comfort and ease, the calm and the quiet…?
   1024537|00000000||We're here. The hot springs.
   1024539|00000000||Huh… Water's like anywhere else. 'Cept it's warm.
   1024541|00000000||Why'd you bring us here? Aimin' to take a bath?
   1024543|00000000||Naye. Aim to watch as others do… Ginger Hilma, for one. She's to come here with her sisters.
   1024545|00000000||Hilma? The Ginger Hilma? Olgar, you swine, you clever, clever swine! Give us a hug!
    351055|00000000||Hey! Where you goin'?!
   1050133|00000000||Thanks be to Freya for sendin' ye, witcher!
   1046688|00000000||Know what this one druid told me? That we'll have naught to breathe if we cut down all the trees!
   1046690|00000000||What's that to do with the price of tea in Zerrikania?
   1046692|00000000||Well, 'cause… Plants, see, they drink water and take the sun… then air flies outta them… or somethin'.
   1047222|00000000||What're ye on about? Ye mean to say we breathe tree farts? My word, I've never heard anythin' so foolish in me life!
   1055695|2952d203||Tangalore
   1074445|00000000||Come, the landing's not far.
   1074451|00000000||We should explore the ship.
   1074454|00000000||Come with me. I've an idea.
   1028795|00000000||Wouldn't mind a few rounds of cards.
   1028794|00000000||How about a game of cards?
    421610|00000000||So long.
    421606|00000000||Farewell.
    421604|00000000||What do you have in stock?
    421608|00000000||Show me your wares.
    421602|00000000||Greetings. Lookin' to buy?
    521735|00000000||If you win, you're entitled to fight our champion.
   1053064|00000000||Fight!
    521736|00000000||Let's not keep Einar waiting.
    521738|00000000||May it be a clean and beautiful fight.
    521722|00000000||Why not.
    521730|00000000||I'll try another time.
    521724|00000000||Another time.
    521723|00000000||Who's Einar?
    521725|00000000||Einar looks like quite the fighter.
    521727|00000000||He's Madman Lugos' bastard. Takes after his da.
    521729|00000000||So we gonna fight or chatter?
    521720|00000000||Looking for more challengers?
    546422|00000000||Welcome to our tournament, witcher. Einar awaits an opponent - do you wish to face him?
    546429|00000000||Einar still want to fight?
    546431|00000000||That's all he's good for. You wish to face him?
   1071438|53736c2d||Thorleif
   1071067|00000000||This one here… Doesn't look like a Vildkaarl to me.
   1071069|00000000||Aye, true. More slender in the shoulders, no tattoos… Interestin'.
    562933|00000000||Body covered in bruises… Knuckles chafed raw.
    562935|00000000||Fought bare-fisted. To the death.
    584164|00000000||Some kind of trial?
    584166|00000000||Probably. Or a very bloody sport.
   1047144|00000000||Da's gonna kill me… and then he'll kill Håvard!
   1047146|00000000||Your da's not goin' to kill anyone. But you can't stay with 'im. You're a Drummond, Håvard's an Craite…
   1047148|00000000||I can't leave him… I'm carryin' his child.
   1047187|00000000||What's left for me? To throw meself in the sea?!
    521508|00000000||The outlander's won!
    521509|00000000||Eryka, wait!
    542845|00000000||Let her go.
    521513|00000000||Outlander's won! Honor and glory are his!
   1075623|00000000||You've Einar still to fight.
   1047141|00000000||You've two bouts more 'fore you can challenge for the title of best in Skellige. You've got to defeat Einar, to be found on Faroe, and one Grim of Helmstein, a village on Ard Skellig. Good luck to ye.
   1075625|00000000||You've still Grim to face. A worthy foe.
    521385|00000000||The outlander's proven himself worthy o' facin' Olaf! Your opponent, Skellige's champion, awaits on An Skellig.
    521381|00000000||Our winner is the outlander!
    521382|00000000||You promised!
    521383|00000000||Pansy.
    521384|00000000||She wasn't worth it.
    521510|00000000||Valgard's won!
    521511|00000000||Hah!
    521512|00000000||You're good, real good.
    542849|00000000||Didn't even break a sweat.
    521515|00000000||Our winner is Valgard!
    542859|00000000||You can come back anytime, challenge 'im again. Them's the rules.
    521430|00000000||Valgard wins!
    521431|00000000||Thanks!
    521432|00000000||You're good with your hands.
    542840|00000000||Aye, I am.
   1001794|00000000||You've paid your debt. You're a free man.
   1001518|00000000||It's over, we leave soon. But first… your gold.
    594825|00000000||Gonna tell your father what you faced in the Cave of Dreams?
    594827|00000000||Course I will. I've no fear of 'im, right?
    594829|00000000||Twas an honor to fight at your side. Farewell, Geralt.
   1075710|00000000||Was I-- Was I out long?
   1075712|00000000||Aye. A while.
    585545|00000000||Your gold. Take it and get outta my sight.
    594818|00000000||What's this ab--?
    594820|00000000||My father sent a messenger. You were bound by honor to help me. Yet you demanded payment.
    594822|00000000||Take your gold, go, and keep away from our lands.
    585539|00000000||Get up, Geralt.
    421428|00000000||Farewell.
    421422|00000000||Farewell.
    421418|00000000||Like to look at your goods.
    421426|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your wares.
    421424|00000000||What brings you to me?
    392786|00000000||This is none of my business.
    392836|00000000||Peasant squabbles - just not interested.
    392941|00000000||Oh, wise words. You're not from here, you can't understand.
    392943|00000000||What're you staring at, people?! Justice has been served! Go to your homes!
    392945|00000000||And you, witcher - on your way. No monsters left 'round here.
    392802|00000000||You're not worth the trouble.
    392981|00000000||Argh. You people aren't worth the trouble.
    393038|00000000||Don't understand a thing, do you, witcher? Guess you don't need to. Killing monsters - that's what you're good for.
    394905|00000000||So best be on your way, 'cause there's no monsters left 'round here!
    392804|00000000||Think the village will go along with this?
    392806|00000000||Folk will calm down, realize the guilty needed to be punished.
    392810|00000000||D'you hear?! Fear will not rule my village! There will be no more killings! Go to your homes!
    392812|00000000||And you, witcher - on your way! No more monsters left around here.
    392800|00000000||Everyone saw the murder.
    392788|00000000||Nothing's changed. Leshen's gone, true, but a murderer still haunts the village.
    392790|00000000||Your work is done, witcher. You've done your part, and I've done mine.
    392784|00000000||You're a murderer.
    392775|00000000||Hey! Hey, look at this! Told you the witcher'd solve this!
    392777|00000000||What happened?
    392779|00000000||You rid us of the beast, we rid ourselves of its accomplices.
    392782|00000000||Don't worry, our agreement stands. Earned your coin, you did.
   1049104|00000000||How might I serve you?
   1049100|00000000||Can I have a word?
   1049102|00000000||I serve the goddess and her flock. What can I help you with?
   1049685|00000000||What's with the horseshoes?
   1050500|00000000||Those who wish to race in the Heroes' Pursuits hang them there.
   1050502|00000000||That a series of races? Hmm…
   1049105|00000000||What're the horseshoes about?
   1050527|00000000||Bit of exercise never killed anyone… So, where're the races held?
   1050543|00000000||The first three on Ard Skellig. Whoever wins each at least once returns here to Hindarsfjall to face last year's best rider in a final pursuit.
   1050545|00000000||Gotcha. What's his name?
   1050547|00000000||You mean, hers. Astrid of Spikeroog, known as the Vipress.
   1050549|00000000||Lovely as monickers go.
   1050551|00000000||And completely deserved… Good luck, witcher. May your deeds bring the goddess pleasure.
   1050515|00000000||I'll race.
   1050529|00000000||Winner get a reward of any kind?
   1050531|00000000||He covers himself in glory, basks in proof of his valor.
   1050533|00000000||Mhm. Was hoping for something a little more… tangible.
   1050535|00000000||To us such things matter least… But yes, the winner receives something to remind him of his feat. At times it is a sword, at others a helmet or a shield.
   1050553|00000000||How about that. See, you can be practical if you want to.
   1050524|00000000||What's the reward?
   1050516|00000000||Maybe some other time.
   1050518|00000000||Don't lack courage. Time, though, that's another matter… Still might come back. Take care.
   1049110|00000000||Nothing at the moment. Farewell.
   1049106|00000000||Nothing at the moment.
   1048839|00000000||This where I sign up for the race?
   1049108|00000000||You Svana? Here about the Heroes' Pursuits.
   1050504|00000000||Can outsiders sign up, or is this a closed event?
   1050506|00000000||Freya sees no insiders, no outsiders. Any man can pay her tribute by risking his life in the Pursuits.
   1050508|00000000||Our races differ from those on the Continent. We are beholden to one rule alone - first across the line wins. Sometimes he's the swiftest. Other times, it is the one who knocks his opponents off their mounts.
   1050510|00000000||Explains the name… There an entry fee?
   1050512|00000000||Courage. If you do not lack it, hang a horseshoe.
   1050520|00000000||So, witcher? Will you dare take part in the Heroes' Pursuits?
    532236|002e06b1||Bard
    587419|00000000||A Skellige custom I don't know about?
    587421|00000000||If it is, it's new to me as well.
    382047|00000000||Take care.
    382045|00000000||Take care.
    382043|00000000||I'm looking for Cerys.
    347483|00000000||Thanks, but I'm short on time. Looking for a girl. Name's Cerys…
    347485|00000000||Crach an Craite's daughter? She was here, but I've not seen her a while.
    382038|00000000||Sorry to interrupt.
    382040|00000000||You need somethin'? Come, let's have a pint and a chat.
    485988|00000000||All will be fine, you'll see…
    485989|00000000||He…. He shan't forgive me…
    485990|00000000||The witcher will be with you. You'll manage, I know it.
    485991|00000000||Hope you're right.
    452929|f373a1e0||Foglet
    393361|00000000||Piss off.
    393363|00000000||What you starin' at, drifter? Away with ye. Now!
   1071121|00000000||Join with us, Geralt, celebrate. We've a new king.
   1071119|00000000||Drink to me, drink to my health.
   1086142|31c17782||Crab
    583032|05b2f5a3||Djinn
   1087865|00000000||Hullo.
   1087867|00000000||Beh! *Cough cough*
   1087869|00000000||Well, well, well.
   1087871|00000000||What're ye lookin' at?
   1087873|00000000||Seek adventure elsewhere…
   1087875|00000000||Dirty oaf.
    585253|00000000||Ingrid, an old healer, lives at the southern tip of the isle. Bring her here… We've many wounded.
    584081|00000000||Double the watch, search the castle and grounds! Every inch. Now!

   1024504|00000000||Artan, word is you've seen the devastated wood. Is it as bad as they say?
   1024506|00000000||Worse. The trees are dry and twisted, the earth's like ash, and the water's so acidic it burns.
   1024507|00000000||It was magic, it had to be. A kind far mightier than our own.
   1049127|00000000||Settin' out to fish on the morrow? Hear the cod are back from spawnin'.
   1049129|00000000||I'll not get back on me boat till someone clears the bay of drowners.
   1049131|00000000||Then you've a nice wait ahead o' ye. Don't seem anyone who's eager.
   1049133|00000000||Aye… They'll all fight the Black Ones, but when it comes to monsters, there's no courage to be found.
   1054055|00000000||Some whoreson's plundered the castle!
   1054057|00000000||Disturbed our ghostly forefathers' slumber.
   1054059|00000000||Treasure huntin', must've been! Filthy thief.
   1054061|00000000||Fenrir the Wolf devour the bugger!
   1022383|00000000||Come here! Please!
   1022382|00000000||Over here! I'm in here!
    484068|00000000||What happened to him?
    484071|00000000||I say something wrong?
    484080|00000000||You must forgive the jarl. Hasn't been feeling well of late.
    484088|00000000||Is he sick? He didn't seem quite right during Crach's feast, but…
    487630|00000000||Where's Cerys?! I've gotta find her!
    487632|00000000||Errr… I don't know. Ask around!
    489322|00000000||Great.
    487636|00000000||A promising start…
    492392|00000000||Aaaaa!
    487628|00000000||Forgive me, I must go to him.
    484099|00000000||I'm looking for Cerys. Any idea where she might be?
    488956|00000000||I hope she's gone to the village. It's been a time since she visited. She wished to speak to our folk, but…
    488957|00000000||But?
    487619|00000000||I worry she might've gone to Jarl Udalryk's old family home. Though I tried to dissuade her.
    487621|00000000||Clan Brokvar have something to hide from the an Craite?
    487623|00000000||No, it's not that… The house is a strange place. Many believe it haunted.
    487624|00000000||Great, I love haunted houses. But why would Cerys go there?
    484100|00000000||Before she left, she had a long talk with the jarl. Seems she wanted to help him.
    484102|00000000||With what?
    484069|00000000||Know where Cerys is?
    348994|00000000||Looking for Cerys. Heard she stayed here.
    349027|00000000||An Craite's daughter? Aye, she was here.
    349037|00000000||Where is she now?
    492332|00000000||Mmm… What?
    492351|00000000||Cerys. Where's Cerys.
    492355|00000000||Dunno… dunno. Enough of the questions.
    492071|00000000||… And then a giant sea snake swam up and bit my arm off… The gods have spoken: a sacrifice is needed.
    342338|00000000||To my mind it's about you defeating a snake, Jarl.
    167737|00000000||No. They demand a sacrifice. I'm sure of it. It's time.
    430777|00000000||We must wait for a clearer sign. At least till your next dreaming.
    462433|00000000||I don't need no more signs.
    313991|00000000||We'll be done in a moment.
   1010339|00000000||Footprints… Wonder where they lead.
    572608|00000000||Heeey theeere!
    572610|00000000||Wanna play hide-n-seek?
    572612|00000000||How old're you?
    572624|00000000||Take me with you!
    572614|00000000||Got a betrothed?
    572622|00000000||I'll be a priestess when I grow up! Don't want no stinky husband!
    572616|00000000||Ouch! That hurt!
    572618|00000000||Oh my!
    572620|00000000||Run!
   1086458|84bb950e||Dimun Shieldmaiden
    586611|00000000||Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends.
    586613|00000000||Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown.
    586615|00000000||Let us swear him fealty.
    586618|00000000||Skellige has chosen!
    586621|00000000||An Craite! An Craite! An Craite! An Craite!
    586624|00000000||I know you've long awaited this day.
    586626|00000000||We strike at Nilfgaard!
    586629|00000000||Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar!
    586591|00000000||I know some would see another in my place.
    586594|00000000||I thank those who stood at my side.
    586597|00000000||Here, beneath the Sacred Oak, I pledge to be a good queen to the ones and the others.
    586599|00000000||I want peace and prosperity to reign in Skellige.
    586601|00000000||And I count on you to help me fulfill that dream.
    586604|00000000||Cerys! Cerys! Cerys! Cerys!
    586584|00000000||Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends.
    586586|00000000||Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown.
    586588|00000000||Let us swear her fealty.
   1032452|00000000||Me youngest was the same - thin as an eel, shy as a lass. Now look at 'im!
   1032454|00000000||Aye, Svanrige'll grow some stones, yet. Bran's blood will awaken, rise within 'im.
   1032457|00000000||Just let 'im be crowned, lead his first raid. We'll see it pulse, then.
   1032459|00000000||So long as Birna lets 'im off her leash.
   1032467|00000000||Don't ye go talkin' 'bout the konung's widow like that!
    595591|00000000||Ugh, she will still be mine.
    595592|00000000||Over my dead body.
    595745|00000000||Nothing simpler.
   1053522|00000000||Dropped from on high. Wonder who this is?
   1053524|00000000||Nils. Gotta be. Some monster dropped him from high up.
   1054022|00000000||Britt wasn't lying.
   1048438|cb8e3ab1||Horse
   1070415|00000000||So 'tis true… Warriors who become bears…
   1070417|00000000||I'd say it's the opposite. I saw their transformative ritual… Our Trial of the Grasses - pure pleasure by comparison.
   1070419|00000000||The Vildkaarls have been punished. You and Hjalmar saw to that. But our true foe continues to prowl about. I sense hard times ahead for Skellige.
    584592|00000000||I do have a horse in the race. Can't refuse, to be honest.
    584594|00000000||As I thought. Well, let's go.
    584022|00000000||Gladly.
    584596|00000000||Might join you later.
    584598|00000000||Countin' on it. As are my children.
    584023|00000000||Might join you later.
    567553|00000000||Hm, but enough. Whatever comes, we must endure. I thank you, Geralt. Again.
    567554|00000000||No need. Again.
    584532|00000000||I'll not take any more of this modesty. This is a land of heroes! Let this remind you of that.
    584586|00000000||And now… I must ride for Geddyneith, for the jarls' council. Time to pick a king.
    584588|00000000||What do you think - who'll get the nod?
    584590|00000000||Come with me, see for yourself. All may listen to our deliberations.
   1070408|00000000||Birna had a lust for power, I knew this… But so strong as to commit such a crime?!
   1070410|00000000||What about Svanrige? What's his fate?
   1070412|00000000||He'll lose his home, his name, his honor. He'll chose exile… or death.
    491813|00000000||Aye? What's it you need?
    491831|00000000||Any chance you know who wore this shawl?
    491832|00000000||Course! Jonna, our herbalist. Lives there, in that hut… Oh, she'll be pleased you found it for her!
    491833|00000000||Yeah. Real pleased.
    491816|00000000||Recognize this shawl?
    491817|00000000||Never mind. Farewell.
    505434|00000000||Never mind. Take care.
   1022242|00000000||He loves me… He loves me not… He loves me… He loves me not…
   1022244|00000000||Soothsayin' like that, well, it'd normally be done with a flower, child.
   1022246|00000000||See any flowers 'round here? Me neither! And the chicken needs pluckin' anyways.
    421506|00000000||Have a look at this diagram.
    421496|00000000||I'd like something crafted.
   1028746|00000000||Wouldn't mind a few rounds of gwent.
   1086483|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
    421508|00000000||So long.
    421498|00000000||Farewell.
    421494|00000000||What do you have in stock?
    421504|00000000||What're you selling, what's good?
    421502|00000000||What d'ya need?
    499330|00000000||Oof, stay where y'are - heat from the furnace is somethin' awful.
   1022100|00000000||Think it might be time to get a new stud bull… Ours, well… he's not exactly frisky round the cows.
   1022102|00000000||Ye surprised? He's been at it for years, even ploughin' can get old.
   1022104|00000000||Speak for yourself, Olav!
    173561|c9e5cf0a||Scribe
    500732|00000000||Show me what you've got, monster slayer!
    500731|00000000||Hurry, axe handle's rottin'!
    500730|00000000||Hurry it up, old man!
    421947|00000000||Got a job for you.
    421944|00000000||I'd like you to craft something for me.
   1028752|00000000||Smithing - pretty tiring job… Need a break, maybe, relax a bit? Play a game or two of gwent?
   1086466|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
   1078492|00000000||Whoever ye may be, I owe you me life! Greetings, again.
   1087801|00000000||*Cough cough*
   1087810|00000000||*Cough cough* Greetings.
   1087812|00000000||I'm listening, wanderer.
   1087803|00000000||Freya be with you.
   1087805|00000000||Watch how you walk!
   1087806|00000000||Are you mad, you twit?
   1087814|00000000||Begone.
   1087808|00000000||No amount of prayer can help you now.
    506777|00000000||Looks like Ermion places something in the statue's hand.
    506785|00000000||So, statue, how about a skull…?
    506787|00000000||Hm… Guess you're no indecisive prince.
    506779|00000000||I'll try the skull.
    506840|00000000||Hm, seems like it worked. Who woulda thunk.
    506838|00000000||How about a mug of mead? Statue or not, everybody needs a drink sometimes.
    506780|00000000||Maybe a mug of mead.
    506848|00000000||Need something else. Gotta look around.
    506781|00000000||Need to look around some more.
    506778|00000000||I'll try a pine cone.
    506782|00000000||Whaddaya say we give it a pine cone…?
    506784|00000000||Nothing.
    506849|00000000||Let's try again.
    392742|00000000||You can come out! They're dead.
   1048842|00000000||You're slow. You stopped trying' once you passed the trials.
   1048844|00000000||I stopped tryin' 'cause I'm fightin' you.
   1048846|00000000||Kjarre always says… never underestimate a foe. Not even the weakest.
   1048848|00000000||Why should I care what some old coot says?
   1048850|00000000||Because he's lived to be an old coot. Looks to me you'll not manage that.
   1048852|00000000||That'd be nice - to go into battle arm in arm with a witcher…?
   1048854|00000000||Ah, to hunt Black Ones with Geralt of Rivia at your side!
   1048856|00000000||Geralt's passed the trials. He's one of us now, a man of Skellige, not some Rivia.
   1052038|00000000||Got a different notion of honor than you folk.
   1052042|00000000||Lucky for you, I have a different notion of honor than you Skelligers. Prefer to thank folk with a bottle of something strong, not murder.
   1052044|00000000||Tell no one what happened here, witcher. Simun's got a spear-side cousin on Spikeroog. He learns what you've done here, he'll vow blood revenge. Won't rest till--
   1052046|00000000||Enough. Not another word about pride, feuds or bonds of kinship. You can kill each other without my help from now on.
   1052040|00000000||For a minute there, so did I… I owed him, no two ways about it. He helped me escape from prison.
   1052037|00000000||For a minute there, so did I.
   1051712|00000000||For a minute there… For a minute I thought you'd do it. Thought you'd kill me.
    572601|00000000||*Hu* Maybe there'll be a rainbow!
    572561|00000000||Oh, hey there!
    572563|00000000||Everythin' all right?
    572565|00000000||Them eyes he's got…
    572603|00000000||Aye?
    572567|00000000||Whooooaaa! What a sword!
    572580|00000000||But can you toss an axe? Me brother can!
    572571|00000000||Sorry!
    572575|00000000||Not at all afeard of you! But don't come any closer!
    572578|00000000||Aaaah!
    433695|00000000||Something's pinned under that tree. Can you…?
    440095|00000000||I can.
   1003211|00000000||What'd Eredin want from you, exactly?
   1003212|00000000||The same thing he wanted from you. You don't recall?
   1003213|00000000||Draw a blank on most of my time with them.
   1003214|00000000||We were bait, Geralt. Both of us. Eredin believed Ciri would come for us sooner or later, and he would capture her.
   1003215|00000000||Fortunately, she didn't fall for it.
   1002988|00000000||What'd the Wild Hunt want from you?
   1003216|00000000||How'd you go from being the emperor's hostage to being his ally?
   1003217|00000000||One day, the door of my cell opened, and instead of seeing the usual officer, I saw Emhyr.
   1003218|00000000||He promised to release me and grant me free reign of the imperial treasury - provided I did what he asked.
   1003219|00000000||He told you about Ciri, and you accepted his offer. Why?
   1003251|00000000||Shared aims make for strange bedfellows.
   1003220|00000000||I knew I had to find Ciri before Eredin did. And if any man had the power and the means to help me, it was the emperor.
   1003252|00000000||Besides, once all's said and done, he is her father.
   1003209|00000000||What happened in Nilfgaard?
   1003221|00000000||Why didn't you look for me after you'd recovered your memory and your freedom?
   1003222|00000000||I assumed you would recover quickly and find me first.
   1003223|00000000||You had mages to help you, I was on my own.
   1003224|00000000||Well, not entirely… Besides, I knew you'd fled the Hunt - Eredin would never have let you go. He'd erased my memory, but you escaped - it was wholly possible he hadn't had the chance with you.
   1003253|00000000||And there were your witcher mutations - I expected they'd stave off any serious injury.
   1002989|00000000||Why didn't you look for me?
   1003357|00000000||Still can't get something out of my mind…
   1003359|00000000||What?
   1002990|00000000||What we talked about earlier…
    373614|00000000||So long.
    373638|00000000||Thanks, Yen. See you later.
   1003360|00000000||See you.
   1003116|00000000||Your time with the Hunt - what do you remember?
   1003117|00000000||When the Hunt had you… hope they didn't hurt you.
   1003118|00000000||Even if they did, I've no memory of it. The whole time's but a string of phantom images. Blood and fire… a wild chase through different worlds… all shrouded in fog.
   1003119|00000000||Though I do remember you coming for me, trading your life for mine. I hadn't the chance to thank you then.
   1003235|00000000||You'd 'ave done the same for me.
   1010656|00000000||I'm touched by your certainty. But you've yet to tell me how you escaped them.
   1010658|00000000||Wouldn't mind knowing that myself. There are times I remember rushing forward, Red Riders around me. Next thing I know, I'm in the woods at the foot of Kaer Morhen. That's it.
   1002985|00000000||Ever think about the past? About your time with the Hunt?
   1002987|00000000||At times… I'm amazed we survived. Eredin's not usually one to leave witnesses behind.
   1002996|00000000||That's just it, he didn't. Lost my memory when I escaped the Hunt.
   1003087|00000000||Ah yes, your famous amnesia…
   1003088|00000000||You didn't have it?
   1003089|00000000||For a short time only. Once the emperor's mages got their hands on me, my memory quickly returned.
   1010648|00000000||We started talking about the past…
   1010650|00000000||But didn't finish.
   1003299|00000000||I wanna talk about the past, the Wild Hunt.
   1123820|00000000||Yen, can we talk?
   1123822|00000000||Why, so you can ask me if we can remain friends, despite all?
   1123824|00000000||No, I-- I mean--
   1123826|00000000||Come, now, Geralt. I know you. Well enough to know exactly what's going on with you and Triss.
   1123829|00000000||Now, I cannot say I'm not tempted to, hm, intervene, but… I believe I'll let it lie this time.
   1123832|00000000||How about that? You came here to fumble your way through an explanation, yet instead of enjoying the show, I went and did your job for you.
   1123834|00000000||Seems so.
   1123836|00000000||But now, enough of this maudlin business. We've something to do, remember?
   1123983|00000000||Yen, wanted to talk about me and Triss…
   1123797|00000000||So, feel any different after our encounter with the djinn?
   1123799|00000000||Yes. Now I feel… regret.
   1123802|00000000||Mean to say that--?
   1123805|00000000||That I regret we didn't try that earlier. Much earlier.
   1123808|00000000||Think we would've argued less?
   1123810|00000000||Quite the opposite. But the other moments would have been more intense as well.
   1123812|00000000||Moments like this.
   1123984|00000000||Our encounter with the djinn - feeling any effects?
   1126970|00000000||Listen… this mark - can you do anything about it?
   1126973|00000000||I can scratch it if it itches, but I fear that's all.
   1126975|00000000||I'm not joking, Yen.
   1126977|00000000||Neither am I. These symbols… it's ancient, powerful magic. I've no notion how to remove them.
   1126979|00000000||Dammit.
   1126981|00000000||You're still one of the prettiest witchers around in my book. Second only to Lambert.
   1126982|00000000||This mark - help me get rid of it?
   1002974|00000000||Why'd you two leave me at the Kingfisher?
   1002977|00000000||You and Triss have a good time?
   1002979|00000000||Splendid. We finally got the chance to talk.
   1002981|00000000||What about?
   1002983|00000000||Everything but you. Geralt of Rivia's no longer a subject of any interest to either of us.
    537150|00000000||Geralt?
   1022131|00000000||Hey! Look! A skel'ton! A real skel'ton!
   1022133|00000000||Hear that? It just said somethin'!
   1022135|00000000||I didn't hear nothin'…
   1022137|00000000||Booo!
   1022139|00000000||Eeeek! Ove, you dummy!
   1072292|00000000||Getting nowhere. Curse wasn't cast at the lighthouse alone.
   1072387|00000000||It's not just about this place. There's someone, someone cursed. Gotta find them.
   1072294|00000000||If Mikkjal's the cursed one, the curse binds him to this place.
   1072389|00000000||He's the only one who can light the fire that'll break the curse.
   1072290|00000000||Symbols of a bonding. Manifestations of ill will, focused, concentrated…
   1072385|00000000||So it's a curse. A curse that keeps the specters here.
    535552|00000000||Storm approaching!
    535554|00000000||Reef in the sails!
    535556|00000000||Bring her about! Head to wind!
   1065901|00000000||Storm approaching!
   1065903|00000000||Reef in the sails!
   1065905|00000000||Bring her about! Head to wind!
    463401|00000000||Had enough?
    463403|00000000||Best finish me now, 'cause you'll be fucked once I catch my breath.
    463405|00000000||It was a good fight. That's enough for now.
    463409|00000000||So? Had enough?
    463411|00000000||You fight well, Steingrim.
    514746|00000000||One day I'll show you how I drink.
    463219|00000000||Back off, or I'll kill you.
    463222|00000000||I'm not afeard of dyin'.
    463240|00000000||See I've landed on Ard Skellig…
    463242|00000000||How you figure that?
    463244|00000000||You're wearing Clan an Craite colors. Ard Skellig's their island.
    463226|00000000||You of clan an Craite?
    463224|00000000||Rob corpses much?
    463246|00000000||Rob every corpse that washes up on shore?
    463248|00000000||Takin' from a corpse ain't theft. I'm a man o' the Isles. I don't reap, I don't sow - the waves bring me my harvest.
    463228|00000000||On the Atropos, were you?
    463230|00000000||Yeah. Thought the captain had a deal with you.
    463232|00000000||With us? Meanin' who, exactly? Might've arranged somethin' with Lugos, but Crach? Nay. Clearly should've, though. Outlander ships aren't welcome in these waters. What about you? What do you seek in Skellige, eh?
    463234|00000000||Agreed to meet a sorceress here - Yennefer of Vengerberg. She's supposed to be on Ard Skellig.
    463238|00000000||There's a witch at Kaer Trolde - Crach's guest. Could be the one you're meetin'.
    463256|00000000||Don't like her?
    463262|00000000||That scorn I hear in your voice?
    463264|00000000||You've good ears. Folk say this witch's got Crach wrapped around her finger.
    514602|00000000||Orders everyone about. Word is she's vicious at it, but a hag's a hag.
    463254|00000000||What's Crach's guest look like?
    463258|00000000||Seen her? Know what the sorceress looks like?
    463260|00000000||Aye. Wears black and white. If not for her tits you'd think she was a beached orca.
    514600|00000000||Fact is, even those who see her for a wench'd gladly push her out to sea, tits and all.
    514722|00000000||What's your name?
    514724|00000000||Steingrim.
    463390|00000000||Well, Steingrim, I don't like you. In fact, I feel like slapping you.
    463392|00000000||Go ahead, drifter. You try.
    463268|00000000||I'm gonna slap you.
    463266|00000000||Sorceresses can be like that.
    463272|00000000||Yennefer's not all bad. Once you get to know her.
    463384|00000000||Heheh, take your word for it.
    514742|00000000||Know the way to Kaer Trolde?
    514744|00000000||Expect I'll find it.
    433310|00000000||Head north, then turn west towards the bay before you come to the bridge. You'll find the jarl portside today. Your sorceress oughta be there, too.
    439426|00000000||Thanks. So long.
    363341|00000000||See you're settlin' in like a ship run aground.
    363343|00000000||Wanted to look around. I like to know where I've landed.
   1056251|00000000||That how you want it? More blood? Fine. We'll make it a fight to the death…
   1056323|00000000||Trofast! Get 'im, boy!
   1075879|00000000||Eredin… King of the Wild Hunt. And Ciri…
    497640|00000000||Pull up!
    497642|00000000||What?!
    497629|00000000||See the path? It'll take you to the Rock.
    497631|00000000||What about you?
    497633|00000000||I'll get 'em off your tail.
    497635|00000000||I shall come back with Avallac'h. Together--
    497637|00000000||Go!
   1024680|00000000||I've asked Freya, begged Hemdall - and nothin'. Maybe Uroboros'll listen.
   1024682|00000000||And what is it ye wish to ask?
   1024684|00000000||To bring me Aldis back to me, back to life.
   1024686|00000000||Oooh, not even Uroboros can do that… At best, he'd sooner take you to join her.
   1055557|31c9db84||Vagn
   1022187|00000000||Ye put it here, hold it, and chop. Like this.
   1022189|00000000||I know that already…
   1022191|00000000||Why're ye poutin' now?
   1022193|00000000||We're cuttin wood for a henhouse. And I wanna build a longship!
   1022195|00000000||The time'll come for that. But you gotta start with the fundamentals. So c'mere, look.
   1043464|00000000||The druids claims Ragh nar Roog's comin'…
   1043466|00000000||Just how do they know when the end of the world'll come?
   1043468|00000000||They can't even say what the weather'll be two days hence!
   1022041|00000000||Did ye know a cow's got two stomachs?
   1022043|00000000||What for?
   1022045|00000000||Dunno… Maybe one for supper, the other for desert?
    523531|00000000||Geralt of Rivia - enter the arena.
    523530|00000000||Geralt of Rivia - enter the arena.
    546111|00000000||Emerge victorious, and you'll have the honor to face the Champion of Champions.
    523528|00000000||I'll fight as though my life depended on it.
    546117|00000000||What do they call ye?
    546119|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    523522|00000000||I'll fight as though my life depended on it.
    523491|00000000||Farewell.
    523492|00000000||Not gonna fight now. Not in the mood.
    523527|00000000||Changed my mind. I'm not gonna fight Olaf.
    546106|00000000||Change your mind again - be sure to come back.
    523524|00000000||I'm withdrawing.
    523523|00000000||Why's that? What makes it special here?
    523525|00000000||What makes your tradition special?
    523526|00000000||Warrior by the name of Duns Ursus once lived on An Skellig. Fought monsters with his bare hands. Tourney's held in his honor.
    523520|00000000||I wanna face Olaf.
    546095|00000000||Fist fightin's a Skellige tradition. And here on An Skellig, that tradition's damn near hallowed.
    523489|00000000||I wanna fight.
    523490|00000000||Wow - got a real arena here.
    523495|00000000||Hm, these tourneys are usually held on street corners, in taverns at best… Got a real arena here.
    523496|00000000||Built thanks to another's generosity - Birna Bran donated her jewels.
    523497|00000000||All right - where's Olaf?
    523498|00000000||He'll show, soon as he's got an opponent.
    523486|00000000||You've come to fight Olaf… He's long awaited a worthy opponent.
   1042914|00000000||Hjalmar killed the Ice Giant on his own, didn't need no witcher's help.
   1042916|00000000||And when the werebears attacked Kaer Trolde - where were you then?
    391397|00000000||We deal with our own monsters.
    391393|00000000||Don't ye putter 'round here.
    391401|00000000||Don't know ye, don't wanna know ye.
    391399|00000000||Need somethin'?
    391395|00000000||Go back where you come from.
    391407|00000000||Fuck!
    391403|00000000||Split!
    391405|00000000||Fuck me!
    555575|00000000||Game can't hear a hunter in the rain. Can't smell 'im, either.
    552815|00000000||Wench'd like to sit Svanrige on the throne.
    552817|00000000||Don't mean much to me, that.
    552819|00000000||Tellin' ye, it's a marvel. A zefhar, twisted four-fold, reinforced with whale bone. Do I buy it?
    552821|00000000||Will you pester me 'bout that again?
    555665|00000000||Forest grant you generous bounty.
    555667|00000000||Where ye walkin'?!
    555669|00000000||Why you whoreson…!
    555679|00000000||Aaaaa-ah!
    555681|00000000||Spawn of a slave and an eyeless goat!
    555671|00000000||I'll rip out yer liver.
    555673|00000000||Archers! Loose!
    555675|00000000||Faster, dammit! Move!
    555677|00000000||We'll avenge ye!
    459287|00000000||Got back your stolen horn - and I, uh, killed the thieves.
    459297|00000000||Shame, that. They weren't evil men.
    466524|00000000||Didn't give me a choice. Where's my reward?
    466526|00000000||Take it… And next time, slay some damn monsters.
    459283|00000000||Recovered your stolen horn.
    459291|00000000||Farewell.
    459285|00000000||Farewell.
    459281|00000000||Greetings, traveler.
    572477|00000000||Yeah?
    572479|00000000||You look awful.
    572483|00000000||Lemme hold your sword?
    572481|00000000||You hurt? Me da grew pale like you just 'fore he died.
    572485|00000000||Wha-ow!
    572491|00000000||Wanna play?
    572487|00000000||Help!
    572489|00000000||Save me!
    572493|00000000||Greetin's.
    572764|00000000||Gonna be puddles!
   1016275|00000000||Those two boys, the pesky ones… who were they?
   1016277|00000000||Kori and Kraki. Only ever troublesome. As is their father, Leif.
   1016279|00000000||He… interesting in some way?
   1016281|00000000||Depends… If it's liars and cowards that interest you, then very much so.
    578718|00000000||Those two who came pestering… who were they?
    578876|00000000||So long.
    578875|00000000||So long.
    578716|00000000||Don't often get guests from the Continent, do you?
   1016271|00000000||I don't often raise such a hubbub. You must rarely get guests from the Continent.
   1016273|00000000||Aye, true. When a Redanian or a Temerian grows the stones to come to Skellige, they usually go ashore at Kaer Trolde.
   1025101|00000000||Port's good there, merchants aplenty… and the jarl's right merciful to Continentals.
   1019194|00000000||If you're lookin' for a drinkin' companion, you've chosen well. If it's work you want - likewise. There's a monster needs slayin'.
   1019737|00000000||All right. Let me pack.
   1017187|00000000||Thank ye. If it weren't for you, I'd 'ave died of hunger… or fear.
   1037758|00000000||Merciful mother Freya, protect me, deliver me from all evil…
   1038231|00000000||Hey, where you goin'?! Come back!
   1050131|00000000||Freya guided ye here…
    551411|00000000||Your boat spring a leak as well?
    551409|00000000||One wreck after another till I fuckin' die.
    168394|00000000||Knew right off the gods favor you.
    168398|00000000||Go on, butcher a poor old boatwright.
    551395|00000000||How 'bout that.
    550982|00000000||Wham! Bam! Then a wave rolled in so mighty…
    550984|00000000||… it washed all the beer barrels outta of the tavern in Kaer Trolde!
    550986|00000000||{*Whistles*}
    550988|00000000||He could be better off buyin' a flock, fleein' to the hills.
    550990|00000000||Fuck me!
    551397|00000000||Hey there.
    551401|00000000||Whew.
    551407|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    551399|00000000||Man can't work five minutes and not be interrupted.
    551403|00000000||What's this? Eh?
    551405|00000000||No… *Sniff*… aaa…
   1074379|61a85065||Clan Drummond Warrior
    492521|00000000||That's that. Gotta come back the morrow…
    492522|00000000||Rare indeed to get an audience once he gets chattin' with the gods…
    492523|00000000||Hush. We've a jarl who hears the gods. It's a gift, demands respect.
   1024548|00000000||Same thing each time - snares sprung, earth trampled, blood, bits o' flesh… But no game in sight.
   1024550|00000000||Strange. Never heard of anythin' similar.
   1024552|00000000||Oh, I have. On Faroe. Turned out an old bear had taught itself to check the traps, pick 'em clean.
   1024556|00000000||Perhaps we've got ourselves a crafty bugger, too. We'll have to flush 'im out.
    371928|00000000||Passed out. Gotta get her outta here.
   1073137|00000000||Still can't believe Arnvald played a part in it.
   1073139|00000000||Know him well?
   1073141|00000000||Since childhood. He was always tight-lipped, secretive, but never hurt a fly.
    578467|00000000||Gwent - know the game?
    578468|00000000||Do gulls shit off cliffs? Let's see your deck. Been a dull day - we'll play for my Katakan.
    578469|00000000||Care for a round of gwent?
   1041532|00000000||Sure!
    578471|00000000||Show me what you can do.
    578465|00000000||Let's play.
    578473|00000000||We'll play some other time.
    578466|00000000||Another time.
    578464|00000000||Gwent - care to play?
    578475|00000000||Dyin' to gut ye, but then they'd say Lugos had gone even madder. Take my Katakan and sod off.
    578474|00000000||Haha! I won! Come by for another round sometime!
   1042458|00000000||Before I sod off with your Katakan, would you tell me who else I could play?
   1042460|00000000||Played one of your brethren a time ago - Lambert. Sailed here to kill a slyzard. And there's some baron lives in Velen. They say he's got the John Natalis card.
   1042462|00000000||Thanks.
   1010797|00000000||You again?! Get outta here!
   1010757|00000000||Perhaps, but then 'tain't no help to us, neither. Besides, why do you care? You his nanny or somethin'?
   1013578|00000000||Let him pass. I'll pay his toll.
   1010814|00000000||Hah! Knew it! It's his nanny! Seemed a warrior for a bit… Now, why's a bleedin' nanny wear swords across his back?
   1013581|00000000||Want me to show you? I can still change my mind.
   1013584|00000000||Calm now, no need. Coin's there, so let him through. And who's payin' for who - that's no concern of ours.
   1010784|00000000||I'll pay for him.
   1013595|00000000||This is none of my concern. Won't interfere.
   1013597|00000000||As well you shouldn't! On your way, now!
   1010792|00000000||Not worth the trouble. So long.
   1010786|00000000||Let him go or you'll regret it.
   1013508|00000000||No. I'm someone who has weapons and knows how to use them.
   1013510|00000000||Hear that, lads?! He's threatenin' us!
   1013515|00000000||Let's see if his swords're as sharp as his tongue.
   1010756|00000000||That's him! The one killed Sigrun!
   1013609|00000000||Whoreson! It's come time to answer for that!
   1010748|00000000||Let him through. No sweat off your back, no harm done.
   1028167|00000000||Won't pay us in gold, pay us in blood!
   1013394|00000000||But I only wish to pray, pay homage to the gods.
   1013429|00000000||You wanna pass, you gotta pay. Can't let you through elsewise.
   1010746|00000000||Have you no conscience?! The gods will punish you!
   1045404|00000000||That stop!
   1045406|00000000||Quiet like!
   1045419|00000000||Trollo him eats!
   1045402|00000000||Uman! Food!
   1047252|b0efd37b||Dodger
   1025087|00000000||It'll be Hjalmar or Cerys. You'll see.
   1025089|00000000||Hm, I dunno. Svanrige's of Bran's blood - the blood of the king!
   1025091|00000000||That don't mean he was born wearin' a crown.
   1008412|00000000||Why do you want this power?
   1008420|00000000||That I know, but I also want to know how you plan to use it. Wouldn't go to these lengths if it wasn't something important.
   1008422|00000000||You're right. It's important… Even very important.
   1008440|00000000||I understand.
   1008452|00000000||I get it. You wanna know what'll happen if magic no longer binds us…
   1008454|00000000||I want to know, if when the djinn's magic is gone, if we've any magic left of our own.
   1008456|00000000||What if I don't want to?
   1008462|00000000||What if I don't want to know?
   1008464|00000000||I'm afraid you no longer have a choice.
   1008466|00000000||Come, let's search the ship.
   1008458|00000000||Hm… Wondered that myself many times…
   1008460|00000000||You see? We're just a step away from learning the truth.
   1008455|00000000||Fine. Let's do it.
   1008442|00000000||Why would you want to do that?
   1008443|00000000||To see what it's like without it. To see if we'll still matter to one another, or if we'll be like two strangers.
   1008439|00000000||Why?
   1008423|00000000||Ahh… How long has this been going on, Geralt? This thing between us? Fifteen, twenty years?
   1008424|00000000||We repeatedly split up, then return to one another… Something draws us to each other. But I can never be certain if it's a true feeling, or merely a bit of mischief by a djinn.
   1008426|00000000||So that's it… This is about my last wish.
   1008427|00000000||You asked that djinn to bind us together forever. I want to ask this one to take that wish back.
   1008414|00000000||Won't worm your way out of it, not this time. Tell me the truth, or I'll leave.
   1008416|00000000||You needn't resort to blackmail. You would've learned, eventually.
   1008418|00000000||True. But after the fact. I want to know now.
   1008411|00000000||Tell me or I leave.
   1008360|00000000||…Three.
   1008362|00000000||Said you were gonna go on three.
   1008364|00000000||I did.
   1008366|00000000||Look. We must search the area.
   1008409|00000000||Yen, not so fast. Gotta tell me what this is about first. Why do you want this djinn?
    582154|00000000||But you already know. A djinn's power is priceless to a mage.
   1044211|00000000||Thanks. Though showing me the way outta here'd be thanks enough.
   1042533|00000000||Consider it done. And should you ever visit Kovir, do stop by Pont Vanis.
   1044214|00000000||Aburraghi v'arathern...
   1042725|00000000||Wait! What're you doing?!
   1042722|00000000||Thanks. Though I'd be more than satisfied if you calmed that storm, then took this tower somewhere else.
   1042718|00000000||Gottfried's treatise proved highly useful. It's over.
   1042720|00000000||Had you not arrived, I'd still be in that cage, surely. It's a trifle, but take it, please. Proof of my gratitude.
   1047109|00000000||It's a weight off me heart, lemme tell ye…
   1047111|00000000||Your brother back from the raid?
   1047113|00000000||He's back, back indeed. Tomorrow we sail to pay tribute to the new king.
   1047115|00000000||Hael Svanrige!
   1047080|00000000||His son's.
   1047074|00000000||Wait… are ye sayin' that they…?!
   1047076|00000000||Not sayin' a thing. Just thinkin' aloud.
   1047078|00000000||His daughter's.
   1047070|00000000||Quite the coincidence, I must say…
   1047072|00000000||King Bran dies all of a sudden, then those bears… And next thing you know, Crach's preparin' for a coronation.
   1046466|00000000||This quiet worries me. It's the calm before the storm, I can feel it in me bones.
   1047064|00000000||Ehh, Ole-Kristian, you're a poor soothsayer…
   1047066|00000000||An interregnum means chaos. A chance for an Craite to oust us from Ard Skellig…
   1047068|00000000||Our jarl's no spring chicken. He's more than a match for Crach in battle.
    585611|00000000||Talking won't help anything.
    585607|00000000||Let's look around.
    585609|00000000||Lemme know what you find. I'll speak to the others. Maybe someone saw more than I did.
    585613|00000000||We've talked enough.
    585570|00000000||Let's look around.
    585578|00000000||But you could name the claimants to the throne who survived in one breath - you, Hjalmar, and Svanrige.
    585580|00000000||What're you sayin'?
    585582|00000000||Nothing - just yet.
   1073337|00000000||I heard you helped Lugos - as you helped me with the hym.
    585574|00000000||Know who died?
    585576|00000000||Drogodar, Draig Bon-Dhu, Blueboy Lugos, Halbjorn, Otrygg… Take some time mention them all.
    585572|00000000||Who died?
    585571|00000000||What happened before the massacre? Be precise.
    585584|00000000||What happened before the massacre? Be precise.
    585586|00000000||Yo-young Lugos bet he could empty a barrel of beer in one go. He climbed on a table, grabbed a pony keg of Cintrian wheat and started chuggin'.
    585588|00000000||Err, his throat bulged like a blowfish, face went red… but he kept drinkin'. Folk started bangin' their tankards on the table, shoutin' "Lu-gos, Lu-gos!"
    587548|00000000||Then, from the other side of the room, we heard this roar!
    585590|00000000||We turned in unison as if a coxswain had called! They were there. They were already there! Folks closest to the bears didn't even manage to draw their weapons. They… they were ripped to shreds.
    585592|00000000||We'll avenge them. I promise.
    567552|00000000||Ever see anythin' like that?
    567551|00000000||No. And I hope I never will again.
    585562|00000000||Where'd the bears come from? We were all laughin', eatin', drinkin'…
    585564|00000000||Then suddenly - a massacre. Torrents of blood on the walls.
   1024743|00000000||I ever tell you what my uncle did?
   1024745|00000000||Wait… He was a butcher, right? In Blandare.
   1024747|00000000||Summers I'd help him slaughter. Even then I didn't see as much blood as I did here… after the feast.
   1043617|00000000||The young pup they sent to help us… What'm I to do with 'im?
   1043619|00000000||He don't know a keel from a hull. Just stands there, pickin' his teeth and bendin' nails.
   1043621|00000000||Send 'im to the tavern. Have him bring us some beer.
   1043623|00000000||I know his kind. He'll drink it down along the way, then claim he spilled it…
   1017109|00000000||Phew… It's just you. Learn anythin'?
   1020746|00000000||But… I'm the only one lives here. And I've hurt no one! Troubled not a soul!
   1037708|00000000||We'll come back to that later. Just now, I need your help.
   1037710|00000000||B-but what? I'm no warrior.
   1037712|00000000||Guessed that already. But a curse grips both you and this place, and only you can lift it. Luckily, all you gotta do is light the fire in the lighthouse. Penitent's invincible as long as darkness covers the island.
   1037714|00000000||I-I-I can't go outside! It'll kill me. I can f-feel it. Mayhaps ye could…
   1037895|00000000||I'll escort you. Now no excuses. Grab some oil and let's go. Before I change my mind.
   1020742|00000000||Like luring ships onto the rocks, then looting the wrecks… Don't deny it. I found the letter.
   1020744|00000000||Longboats sink every so often anyway. That's the sea! That's its nature! They sink near the isle, at least the cargo don't go to waste.
   1020712|00000000||Island's haunted by a penitent… Specter punishes the guilty for crimes, foul deeds.
   1017122|00000000||A penitent haunts the island.
   1017114|00000000||Interesting. But, so long.
   1019764|00000000||Yeah, interesting… Well, time I was on my way.
   1019766|00000000||Hey! Hey! Don't leave me here!
   1017099|00000000||Farewell.
   1017123|00000000||Farewell.
   1017113|00000000||I'll help you.
   1017115|00000000||I can try to help. First, though… a couple of questions.
   1017116|00000000||Ask a hundred if you will. Just get me out of here!
   1017119|00000000||This wraith, the big one… Tell me more.
   1017120|00000000||It… It seemed more clever'n the others. Like it knew. Knew everythin'.
   1020550|00000000||Haven't helped much, have I? Sorry, only saw it once. It disappeared right after…
   1017112|00000000||The wraith - tell me more.
   1017111|00000000||Any idea what might've drawn the specters?
   1017117|00000000||These ghosts didn't appear without reason. Something brought 'em here… Any ideas?
   1017118|00000000||No clue. There's nothin' here! The lighthouse, me hut - just rocks besides! Even bloody drowners know there's nothin' for them on Eldberg!
   1017121|00000000||Strange… Need to look around.
   1020552|00000000||Here. This key opens the lighthouse. Ye know, case ye want to look inside… Or ye need to run from somethin'.
   1017105|00000000||Where'd all those wraiths come from? Last saw something like this near Vergen when--
   1019762|00000000||From nowheres! That's just it! Fire went out and wind died of a sudden. That's how it started. Came out here for oil, stepped outta the house, looked up - saw the mist risin'. Then the ghosts showed! Came straight at me!
   1020544|00000000||Bolted back inside, hasped the door, and then I heard it - someone whisperin' me name. Mikkjaal, Mikkjaal! I look out… There's the wraith, big bugger, bigger than the rest. And cold flowin' from it, such cold the windows frosted o'er!
   1017103|00000000||You Mikkjal? The light keeper? Jorund from Arinbjorn sent me.
   1017100|00000000||H-how did ye get here?!
   1017101|00000000||What do you think? It is an island.
    492595|00000000||Welcome to the home of Jarl Udalryk of the honorable clan Brokvar.
    492596|00000000||Greetings. Wanted to see the jarl.
    492597|00000000||Enter. Jarl's still speakin' to his seer, but they should finish soon.
    500773|00000000||One thing - watch where you step.
    500775|00000000||How come?
    500777|00000000||Jarl's not too fond of light. Makes it easy to trip.
   1050127|00000000||You've got our gratitude, Geralt.
    354109|00000000||This mead's clean.
    456844|00000000||Nothing here, either.
    456846|00000000||Blood and mushrooms… Think we can find out where this barrel came from? Looks different.
    582906|00000000||An Craite lasses got more spunk then their men!
    582908|00000000||Good on her! That's a queen I understand!
   1069978|00000000||Long live Hjalmar! Long live our new king!
   1069976|00000000||Hail Cerys! Long may ye live!
    582910|00000000||We'll finally sail against the Black Ones!
    582912|00000000||Long live Hjalmar!
   1049604|00000000||Freya used to look kinder on Spikeroog. We must've angered her somehow.
   1049606|00000000||Just how would that be? We make offerin's. We pray.
   1049608|00000000||But the goddess sees more. She knows what rolls 'round our heads. What we think.
   1049950|00000000||All those deaths, disappearances… 'Tis no accident, but a warnin'. And might well be our last.
   1027751|00000000||What did your brother do?
   1027755|00000000||What'd your brother do? Why'd they chain him?
   1027767|00000000||Your brother'll be fine, I freed him. He's bound to come and find you soon.
   1027769|00000000||Truly? Thank ye, thank ye! I'll never tell another lie, I swear it.
   1027764|00000000||He won't die, I freed him.
   1027772|00000000||Well maybe that'll teach you not to tell stories about others. So long.
   1027765|00000000||Learned your lesson.
   1027757|00000000||Cause… 'Cause… 'Cause I didn't like me uncle, Gretter. He was fat and stank.
   1027759|00000000||Once, I told me brother that uncle… did bad things to me. Yorg flew in a rage and killed him. Then they caught 'im and tied 'im to the rocks.
   1027761|00000000||That's how your laws work. A murderer has to be punished, even if he killed to save someone else.
   1027763|00000000||But… but I lied to Yorg. Uncle did nothin' to me. He stank, and I didn't like 'im, that's it! And now… now Yorg'll die, 'cause o' me.
   1027753|00000000||Why because of you?
   1027750|00000000||Because of you?
   1027427|00000000||What happened here?
   1027428|00000000||Me brother… They chained 'im to the rocks… Because of me!
    167562|00000000||Geralt, do you think I donned an evening dress to show off for the seals?
    352181|00000000||Just wanna get some air.
    352183|00000000||Very well. Once you've aired out thoroughly, find me by the entrance to the feast hall.
    574727|00000000||You didn't win, no… But you didn't break no bones, either. That's somethin' when you race our folk.
    583823|00000000||Well, you've just one Pursuit left to run… On Hindarsfjall. Ride like you did today, and victory's as good as yours.
    574722|00000000||Listen, folk! Our winner is Geralt of Rivia!
   1049135|00000000||You've bathed yourself in honor, witcher. And earned a beautiful prize.
    498105|00000000||An old cradle… Must've belonged to Udalryk or Aki.
    497888|00000000||What's on your thigh, child? That a bruise?
    497890|00000000||This? No… it's a tattoo.
    497891|00000000||So it is… A red rose… It mean anythin'?
    497906|00000000||No, it means that I was young and drunk… And it happened. At least it's not terribly visible.
    497908|00000000||I like it. Wouldn't mind one myself… here, right above me rear…
    497910|00000000||Ach, you need a man, girl. Get more foolish every spring…
    497896|00000000||No. I was young and drunk.
    497894|00000000||I got it for someone special who's dead now.
    497898|00000000||It's a souvenir... of someone special who's dead now.
    497900|00000000||I picture it already… You were promised to a handsome lad… He gave you a red rose before sailin' off, but the cruel sea swallowed him…
    497902|00000000||Close.
    497904|00000000||Eeh, child… Those bards've stuffed your head with their foolish romances…
    497895|00000000||I'm still cold.
    497920|00000000||I was worried about drafts… A lung infection's the last thing I need right now…
    497922|00000000||See, Astrid. Girls your age can be sensible after all.
    497925|00000000||Sensible girls aren't tossed on shore by the waves.
    482528|00000000||No, I wasn't in a shipwreck.
    482564|00000000||No, that's not right… I wasn't in a shipwreck.
    482572|00000000||Hmm. So what brings you to our shores?
    482507|00000000||I'd rather not talk about myself.
    482521|00000000||I'd rather… not talk about myself.
    482523|00000000||Why's that?
    482561|00000000||Someone might come looking for me. I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble.
    482525|00000000||It's too late for Skjall…
    484163|00000000||What?
    484175|00000000||Seems nice.
    484187|00000000||Well… he seems nice.
    484189|00000000||Oh, my… He's that bad?
    497932|00000000||Leave it, Astrid. Who she likes is her affair, and it's naught to you.
    484176|00000000||To tell the truth, I prefer women.
    484181|00000000||To be honest… I prefer women.
    484185|00000000||Aye, now I see. The skald sings true. Love bears many guises.
    490613|00000000||Well… why not.
    490618|00000000||I suppose… why not?
    490619|00000000||Head through the door and you'll see the pier. Be careful, it's slippery.
    497945|00000000||Thank you once more.
    497947|00000000||And, once more, there's no need. Gods bless your journey!
    490616|00000000||I'm sorry… but I really must go.
    490612|00000000||I really should go.
    490605|00000000||Listen… It's lovely sitting here with you, but… I really must go now.
    490606|00000000||I understand. Who'd want to stay in this hole? We're all related three times over and the air stinks of fish.
    490607|00000000||I can't see how you're related to anyone here. No one in Lofoten groans and bitches quite like you do! Sit down and be quiet.
    497937|00000000||Child… Skjall's certain to have readied the horses by now, but before you go, you ought to take a quick jump in the water. It'll do you good.
    484191|00000000||I must say, he's rather handsome…
    484193|00000000||Half the village sighs when he passes, but he likes you. A mysterious beauty, arose outta the sea foam…
    484212|00000000||Give it a rest. You're intolerable today!
    484174|00000000||He's not half bad.
    484169|00000000||He's head over heels for you, girl. Sat at your bedside all the day, starin' like you was painted by a master!
    484171|00000000||Astrid! I asked you not to tell her!
    484173|00000000||Oops… Well, now the milk's spilt… do you fancy Skjall?
    482569|00000000||I'm here looking for someone.
    484146|00000000||Not your betrothed, I hope…
    484148|00000000||Why?
    484150|00000000||It'd break Skjall's heart…
    484165|00000000||Yes, my ship… We set sail from Novigrad.
    484167|00000000||And what brings you to Skellige?
    482527|00000000||Yes… of course.
    482509|00000000||You know… I don't really have a home. I'm a traveler.
    482511|00000000||Ah, that's right… Where was your ship headed?
    482517|00000000||Ship?
    482519|00000000||We fished you outta the sea. We thought you were in a shipwreck.
    482506|00000000||I have no home.
    485092|00000000||Here we are, gabbin' away. Steam's gone… gotta douse the coals.
    482501|00000000||Say… back home… have you got saunas, too?
    497914|00000000||I'm not at all shy. I just wanted something to sit on…
    497916|00000000||Mhm. Expect me to believe that?
    497918|00000000||Astrid! Behave yourself or I'll send you to gut fish with your pa!
    497893|00000000||I'm not shy, not at all.
    497884|00000000||But why've you got the towel, child? It'll just get wet…
    497886|00000000||Mum… she's from the Continent… she's shy.
    497875|00000000||Finally! I was so worried she'd--
    497877|00000000||Ach, Mum, you always worry. Everything's fine. Ain't it?
    497880|00000000||Mhm. Yes. It's fine.
    497882|00000000||Good, that's good…
    314300|00000000||And if not for my help…
    314311|00000000||And if not for me, you'd have sat on that rock till you died and rotted.
    314313|00000000||For the love of Freya! All right! Have it your way! You saved me, now what? What, need I march around the country singin' out your praises?!
    314315|00000000||No, just tell me where to find Cerys.
    314318|00000000||Must be daft! You helped me with the sea devils, but that don't mean I'm willin' to gossip 'bout an Craite's daughter!
    314324|00000000||Want me to tell everyone you're a coward?
    314340|00000000||Here are your options: tell me where Cerys is, or I'll tell everyone I found you sitting on a rock, scared witless and screaming like a woman.
    314342|00000000||Ah! Talk all you want. No one'll believe a foreigner tellin' tales about an islander.
    374504|00000000||I have the jarl's blessing.
    374715|00000000||Think for a minute: If not for the jarl, would I know to look for her here?
    374717|00000000||Ah, right. So it's like the jarl himself sent ye.
   1063604|00000000||I'm here at her father's behest. Cerys has been away a while, Crach asked me to make sure she's all right.
    374506|00000000||Shoulda said so at the start.
    314345|00000000||Cerys was supposed to be at Udalryk's but wasn't. I'm starting to worry.
    314326|00000000||I'm worried about her.
    314328|00000000||Tell me where Cerys is.
    314349|00000000||Where's Cerys? Tell me.
    375816|00000000||Thanks, see ya.
    375818|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
    375828|00000000||Went to Udalryk's old family home. Yonder, on the hill.
    375822|00000000||She say where she was headed?
    375824|00000000||Hmm… Wouldn't tell a stranger, but we did risk our hides together.
    375814|00000000||Where did she go?
    375812|00000000||What did she ask you about?
    375820|00000000||Any idea why she came here? She say what she was after, or just admire the scenery?
    314352|00000000||She asked about our jarl and his family.
    314303|00000000||Thanks for your help. Did it once, maybe you can do it again.
    314305|00000000||Well, I'll have to think about it. Busy today wi' me fishin', got nets to mend. No time to fight monsters.
    314307|00000000||It's not drowners this time. It's Cerys. I'm looking for her.
    349715|00000000||Aye, fine-lookin' girl. Can tell right away she's from a good clan. Left her sittin' right here when I sailed out to bring in the morning catch.
    314297|00000000||Need your help.
    314282|00000000||Fuckin' muire d'yaebler! Swarmin' like gulls around a waste heap! Ah, be sure we showed 'em!
    314285|00000000||We? Seem to remember you sitting on that rock, crying for help.
    314295|00000000||Ah, but if not for me warnin', you'd be herrin' bait about now.
    166209|00000000||To a cold, distant shore - I must sail.
    171710|00000000||Cross the wide, somber sea - I will sail.
    171712|00000000||I must leave you behind, you might think me unkind.
    171714|00000000||Cross the wide, somber sea - I will sail.
    457240|00000000||Not now, Geralt.
   1018000|e223a10b||Hunter
    163702|00000000||If me eyes don't deceive me, you are the White Wolf - warrior, lover, philosopher extraordinaire…
    163704|00000000||Someone's fed you a load of...
    163706|00000000||And a friend of the Great Master Dandelion himself!
    163708|00000000||The Great Master Dandelion?
    163710|00000000||Aye, who built you a monument more lasting than any of bronze. When next you see him, White Wolf, please convey the great esteem in which I, Sigurd, hold his many achievements.
    163712|00000000||Oh, I'll be sure to tell him exactly what I think of his... tales.
    163714|00000000||It would be a disgrace to censor such an artist. Though a smith by trade, I too do my best work in words.
   1086635|00000000||Like to look at your goods.
   1086494|00000000||Gwent - how about we play?
    500857|00000000||See you.
    163718|00000000||Take care.
    163716|00000000||I'd like to reforge my sword.
    421430|00000000||Need something crafted.
    500823|00000000||White Wolf!
    587236|00000000||Follow the thread…
   1055555|770e6af8||Boatwright's Apprentice
    562399|00000000||Right behind you.
    562400|00000000||That's a relief.
   1070364|00000000||We keep the poison at the cellar's other end, down below. Come, I'll show you.
   1072729|00000000||Need to keep looking. He came through here, had to.
    524526|00000000||Oh gods - near twenty of 'em… But no Hjalmar.
    581719|00000000||How do you call a sheep…? Here, sheepy, sheepy? Hey, sheep! C'mere. We got us a forktail to hunt.
   1021540|00000000||It's not too late. Apologize and I'll spare ye.
   1021542|00000000||What ye can spare me is your lip, Sven! Enough of this talk!
    370227|f0d0bf53||Werewolf
   1077539|00000000||[Short hair and pony tail.]
   1077541|00000000||[Long hair let down.]
   1077542|00000000||[Just a shave.]
    421351|00000000||So long.
   1077543|00000000||Farewell.
   1077540|00000000||[Shaved head and ponytail.]
    577797|00000000||Take it you're good with scissors. Give me a haircut?
    577798|00000000||Tain't somethin' I usually do… but it wouldn't be right to turn down a traveler.
    577796|00000000||Can you cut my hair?
    421766|00000000||So long.
    421768|00000000||Come see me again some time.
    421764|00000000||Farewell.
    421762|00000000||Let me look at your goods.
    421770|00000000||Gladly look at what you got.
    433871|00000000||Wise man. No common rags among my wares.
    409336|00000000||Greetings.
    377131|00000000||Smooth seas this morn. As if the gods themselves were payin' their respects to the great Konung Bran.
    377133|00000000||You a tailor?
    354964|00000000||I am. Only one in the Isles, most like.
    409338|00000000||Hey, Sjusta.
    354979|00000000||Hello, witcher. Good to see you, but if you come to ask 'bout new finery for the feast, I'm afraid there'll be trouble. I've only two doublets left.
    587555|00000000||We've talked enough.
    353397|00000000||Good. Talkin' tires me.
    353385|00000000||Strong blood? What're you talking about?
    353387|00000000||I speak of the she-bear and her cub.
    353379|00000000||Strong blood? What're you talking about?
    353383|00000000||Like the men whose corpses we found?
    353393|00000000||Like the men whose corpses we found?
    353395|00000000||Aye. Those who wish to join us enter the Ursine Circle in groups of six… We take only three.
    442475|00000000||The weak give their lives in sacrifice. The strong start their lives anew.
    330457|00000000||Lookin' for death?
    330459|00000000||Nay. Vengeance.
    587553|00000000||And answers. Why'd you attack Kaer Trolde?
   1072190|00000000||We didn't come to the feast to kill. But we've no regrets about what happened there.
    442456|00000000||There are weaklings in every herd. They must die to make room for those of strong blood.
    501133|00000000||I won, but only by a hair.
    501134|00000000||No such thing. There's winnin', and there's losin'. And I lost.
    516751|00000000||We'd best go back to the wake.
    501135|00000000||Let's.
    501137|00000000||I'm first! Behold - Hjalmar's axe. I beat the famous White Wolf.
    501138|00000000||Congratulations.
    501139|00000000||Let's go back.
    501140|00000000||Be glad to tell everyone about your victory.
   1052023|00000000||Take it we're even now.
   1052029|00000000||Take it that makes us even.
   1052031|00000000||Aye, aye… I'll settle me other scores meself. They're ancient history now… but I remember.
   1052033|00000000||Farewell, witcher. Wind fill your sails, always.
   1052025|00000000||Talk to yourself often?
   1052027|00000000||Aye… more'n I'd like. Spent years hidin' from Volund's assassins. In caves, on desert isles, in forests deep. Not much company to be had there.
   1052022|00000000||Talk to yourself much?
   1051708|00000000||Ye hunted this Brambling a long time, Volund… But come the end, the Brambling bagged you.
    434181|00000000||An old bread hearth…
    436444|00000000||Should still work, so long as carrion crows haven't made their nests in the chimney.
    434183|00000000||Seven years of bad luck for the fool who shattered this.
    434185|00000000||Hm… Useless.
    434187|00000000||A child's cradle.
    436446|00000000||Looks old. Must've been Udalryk's and Aki's.
   1070308|00000000||Leave me be.
    421941|00000000||Like you to craft some armor for me.
    421939|00000000||Need you to craft something.
   1028765|00000000||What would you say to a few rounds of gwent?
   1086468|00000000||Play some cards?
    421624|00000000||So long.
    421628|00000000||Farewell.
    421626|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    421620|00000000||Show me what you have.
    421618|00000000||How can I help you? Turbulent times - don't pay to skimp on weapons.
    567363|058c52d7||Artis
    412645|00000000||To kill a giant's one thing. But outfoxin' a hym… Now that's a feat!
    412647|00000000||Only one chosen by the gods could accomplish such a thing.
    452657|00000000||So what? We're to have a wench for a king?
    586073|00000000||Wench or no… She's dear to the gods, and that's key.
   1043507|00000000||Thank ye, witcher, thank ye once more!
   1043501|00000000||The trader's come, there's no hope for us.
   1043249|00000000||Quiet, I know 'im. That's Geralt of Rivia, the witcher. A friend of an Craite's. Jarl must've sent 'im to rescue us!
   1047260|00000000||You're mine now. All of you. Now listen and obey. Anyone doesn't, gets cut down like a dog, understood?
   1047991|00000000||Follow me.
    408751|00000000||Thanks for the information.
    408753|00000000||No, I'm the one grateful… for savin' me and the others.
    408372|00000000||Thank ye, witcher! Don't know what would've become of us without ye!
   1043255|00000000||Wait, 'fore you go - that boss, he had a chest in his room, elegant like, cloth covered. I'd bet me right foot he didn't keep spare socks in it.
   1047407|00000000||You're free. Go west, you'll reach a village.
    330610|00000000||Bowl at each table.
    437433|00000000||Mead in this one… Mff. And only mead.
   1070456|00000000||Mead… Untainted.
    303086|062190ab||Leshen
   1074145|00000000||Sky cells - nice idea for a prison without bars. Shame he didn't know how to fly.
    166193|00000000||My Gotten died a hero's death. Faced three Black Ones alone. They cut his arm off at the shoulder.
    171618|00000000||Holte slit his own throat - wouldn't let hisself be took prisoner.
    384682|00000000||Crach's sure to see that you're cared for.
    434460|00000000||Women don't need men to care for them, Geralt.
    434462|00000000||The sorceress speaks true. We take care of ourselves. War and death are twin sisters - we've long known both.
    434502|00000000||No one mourns here. Tears we replace with vengeance. The women of Skellige are fertile, and we birth no cowards.
    376067|00000000||What will become of you?
    384736|00000000||Must say I like the women of Skellige. It's as if each one would make a good sorceress.
    434506|00000000||Can't think of a single sorceress from Skellige. Let alone a famous one.
    434508|00000000||Lytta Neyd. Known also as Coral. Don't you remember?
    434510|00000000||Farewell. May your sons make port as many times as they sail out.
    434512|00000000||As the gods will it, so shall it be.
    434500|00000000||We should go.
    376065|00000000||Oughta be proud of your men.
    384652|00000000||Your husbands died glorious deaths.
    434452|00000000||Oh aye. Gotten captained a longship, near three dozen men aboard. Raided half a dozen Nilfgaardian villages, filled his hull with captives…
    434454|00000000||On the return, they came across a Black fleet... Three galleons... But our men did not flee. Instead, they drew close and boarded... Gotten chopped off an imperial captain's head.
    434456|00000000||Then they backed 'im 'gainst the rails. He died with a war-cry on his lips.
    434458|00000000||My Holte was a scout. Snuck into the enemy's camp. Hounds sniffed 'im out. When the Black Ones surrounded 'im, he slit his own throat. Refused to let them question 'im.
    384648|00000000||I couldn't help overhearing. Fate was unkind to your menfolk.
    352247|00000000||Widows' isles - that's what Skellige is.
    434448|00000000||To you continentals, war started a half year back. We've been fightin' Nilfgaard for years now.
    434450|00000000||And we're not like to ever stop.
    560958|00000000||Did you see their tartans? Clan Tuirseach colors.
   1070523|00000000||Birna?
   1070525|00000000||It's too soon to pass judgment. It could be a ruse, a plot to deceive us… You find anythin'?
    560959|00000000||Just this key. Found it in Arnvald's pocket.
    560960|00000000||Too small for a door key… I might just know what it fits. Let's get back to Kaer Trolde.
    377586|00000000||This be a fuckin' holy site!
    506423|00000000||This'll be tough to open.
    506447|00000000||Surprises never end. See the ravens?
    506448|00000000||Hard not to.
    508699|00000000||Ermion's spies.
    506449|00000000||An indication that we're near his laboratory. I also sense a clear magic aura.
    508703|00000000||Come. There's a ledge outside this window. We must pass along it.
   1070395|00000000||We ride to Fornhala. At a gallop!
   1024174|00000000||Uve… that's enough.
   1024176|00000000||Wait, wait, this one's really funny. What's the difference 'tween a Nilfgaardian and a drowner?
   1024178|00000000||All right, what is it?
   1024180|00000000||Drowners know how to swim! Hehehe!
   1024182|00000000||Ughh. One more knee-slapper like that and you're goin' for a swim with 'em.
   1071015|00000000||Hear us, we beseech you, oh merciful Freya, great Hern and valiant Hemdall! Hear us, oh gods of this land!
   1071010|00000000||Let us thank the gods for interceding. Let us pray they favor our new queen.
   1071021|00000000||Gods bless our king! Fill his heart with wisdom, courage and honor!
   1071023|00000000||May he lead us to victory against the invader! And in his reign may the earth yield a hundredfold more!
   1071017|00000000||Gods bless our queen! Fill her heart with virtue, wisdom and courage!
   1071019|00000000||In her reign may the land flow with milk and honey, and the sea depths swallow the ships of our foes!
   1071012|00000000||Let us thank the gods for interceding. Let us pray they favor our new king.
   1071003|00000000||A day like today - 'tis a rare thing.
    574702|00000000||Racin's like fishin' and love makin'. The less you jabber, the better y'are at it.
    574706|00000000||You rode well. Much better'n I did. Thinkin' I should stick to fishin', leave horses to others…
    574704|00000000||Next time squeeze your mount 'tween your knees and hold the reins short. Horse's gotta feel who's in charge.
    500710|00000000||We're here. From this spot you must reach the top of that mount.
    500711|00000000||At the summit you'll see the stump of an oak, Hjalmar's axe buried in it. Whoever pulls the axe from the stump first, wins.
    500712|00000000||I'm ready.
    500713|00000000||You'll start when I sound the horn.
    580519|00000000||Lead the way.
    580520|00000000||Just once you might try to take the initiative.
    580521|00000000||Would you even let me?
   1006619|00000000||It would depend on the situation.
   1074390|00000000||See you've managed to prepare everything already…
   1074392|00000000||I have.
   1074394|00000000||How could you possibly know I'd agree?
   1074396|00000000||I didn't. Decided to risk it…
    580584|00000000||Geralt, over here.
    371481|c38af1d3||Old Man
    490961|00000000||A Nithing. A powerful curse. Name carved on the shaft… Tjalve, son of Lothar.
    432288|00000000||*Sniff* Earthy scent from the bear's maw. Something towards… mushrooms?
    437435|00000000||Bowl's empty… but the scent's in the air, coming from… mff… somewhere else in this room.
    350767|00000000||Help! Help me pa! Help him, please!
   1038235|00000000||Gotta keep looking… Good thing I at least know where.
   1038233|00000000||No sword here… Got a lead, though - there's that.
   1061961|05edbbdd||Horse
   1022284|00000000||Every lass would want a man like Udalryk… Devoted to the gods, brave…
   1022286|00000000||That's not bravery, that's bravado. And to my eye it's not got much to do with the gods.
   1022290|00000000||I think so, too. He was brave once, true, but now he acts like a madman.
    421420|00000000||Need you to craft something for me.
   1028761|00000000||In the mood for some diversion. A game of gwent'd be best.
   1086482|00000000||Hankering to play cards. Up for a round or two?
   1022580|00000000||Whales in the hundreds…
   1022582|00000000||More. If the legends're true, they've been swimmin' here to die for ages.
   1022584|00000000||When the king o' the whales was dyin', Hemdall himself guided him here, so he could die lookin' at the settin' sun.
   1022586|00000000||From then on whales have come here to die, just like their noble ancestor.
   1071590|00000000||Geralt, help me smash that. We're sure to reach the giant's cave this way!
    442097|00000000||What's this'un want? Get 'im. We'll feed the bastard to the urchins.
   1028791|00000000||We get some cards in, too, I'll be a happy man.
   1028790|00000000||A round of cards - that's what I'd like.
    421339|00000000||So long.
    421335|00000000||Farewell.
    421333|00000000||What're you offering?
    421337|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
    421331|00000000||I see you come from afar. Oughta replenish your supplies, I wager.
   1078120|e8a9c287||Slave Driver
   1023122|00000000||End times are upon us. Neighbor robbin' neighbor, one isle raidin' the other!
   1023131|00000000||Ehh, we robbed our neighbors plenty before. An Skellig, Spikeroog, and--
   1023133|00000000||But that was different! We were in our rights, avengin' past wrongs!
   1023135|00000000||Now we've got fresh scores to settle.
    422574|00000000||Hey, stranger. Lookin' for some entertainment? Want a drink?
    422576|00000000||What kind of entertainment you got in mind?
    422578|00000000||What? Why, beer, mead and strong spirits. Whaddaya expect in a tavern? Jump rope?
    437354|00000000||Don't know where you're from, but I can see it's far off.
    422592|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    422582|00000000||What do you have in stock?
   1028778|00000000||What would you say to a little game of gwent?
   1028777|00000000||In the mood for some cards.
    422594|00000000||Take care.
    422586|00000000||Farewell.
    422584|00000000||What can you tell me about Clan Brokvar?
    422588|00000000||The Brokvar clan - can you tell me about it?
    422590|00000000||We from the Brokvar clan are masters of the sea, bred and born to the water.
    437779|00000000||Thought everyone in Skellige spent a lot of time in the water.
    437781|00000000||Hahaha, they think so, too. But all they do is skim the top of it in their longships, all wrapped up in heavy furs.
    437783|00000000||From time to time the wind blows a bit of spray from the oars in their faces - that's their only contact with water. Whereas our boys, as soon as they can walk, dive off cliffs into the very depths of the sea.
    422580|00000000||Hey. Choose your poison and don't try any tricks.
    510503|00000000||Get up, Geralt! Hear me?!
    510505|00000000||I can't… I'm dead. They killed me.
    509977|00000000||It was a needle coated with a toxin. It pricked you when you tried to open the door.
    510508|00000000||Snap out of it. We've no time to lose.
    520742|00000000||We never mention this again.
    520752|00000000||Mind if we, uh, never mention this again?
    520754|00000000||Naturally.
    520756|00000000||Door's open. We'll proceed as soon as you've collected trophies of your kills.
    520744|00000000||Uh, must've looked strange.
    520746|00000000||Your years of vigorous training at Kaer Morhen finally paid off. Bested nearly all the stuffed beasts in here.
    520748|00000000||Please…
    520750|00000000||Fine. We've passed the Trial of Taxidermy. The door stands open.
    520741|00000000||Must've looked funny.
    508710|00000000||What's happening?
    506676|00000000||You were hallucinating. You ran at Ermion's animals, sword flailing. I had to calm you.
    442702|00000000||A ghost! We're all gonna die!
    442704|00000000||Idgit woman! Ever heard a ghost walk so loud, drag its feet? It's a man, flesh and bone. 'Cept what's he seek here?
    442706|00000000||Just exploring the tunnel other side of the hill.
   1045521|00000000||Greetings to you.
   1045523|00000000||And to you.
   1045519|00000000||Fine. I'll see what I can do about the ghosts.
   1045507|00000000||I'll help you.
   1045511|00000000||Farewell.
   1045509|00000000||Farewell.
   1045508|00000000||It's done. Ghosts're gone.
   1045517|00000000||Took care of the ghosts. Crypt is safe.
   1045513|00000000||Thank ye for your help, Whitehaired One.
   1045515|00000000||We'll make a sacrifice to Freya in your name.
    456323|00000000||Ran into some monsters down there. Already took care of them.
    456325|00000000||Why're you here?
    442710|00000000||Came here to cut nails.
    442712|00000000||Nails?
    442714|00000000||Off corpses. Don't ye know? Wraiths use nails to build their cursed longship.
    449943|00000000||So you're hoping you can make 'em run short of materials.
   1045506|00000000||We would if we could get in the crypts. But there's ghosts inside. Would ye tend to them?
   1045486|00000000||What do you need?
   1045488|00000000||Ye aim to enter the crypts?
   1045490|00000000||Maybe…
   1045476|00000000||The white-haired one… Who is he, I wonder…
   1045478|00000000||A warrior, plain to see. Just what we need.
   1050602|00000000||Come over 'ere, traveler!
   1045482|00000000||Ye clean just monsters outta crypts, or treasures, too…?
   1045484|00000000||With peepers like that, it's no wonder he wanders the crypts. Sun must plain blind him.
   1024935|00000000||I heard Gray Ynge augured your son's future?
   1049934|00000000||Aye! Threw his umbilical in the water - and it coiled into the shape of a snake! Do ye know what that means?
   1049936|00000000||That… he'll be as quick as a viper?
   1049938|00000000||Or he'll slither out of every trap?
   1049940|00000000||Nay, 'twas somethin' different… But I like those readings better! To your health, soothsayers!
    582853|00000000||Was afeared this moment would never come… that her brother would win, and we'd all be lost.
    582855|00000000||Both bear the an Craite name.
    582857|00000000||Yet Hjalmar's as mad as I was when the hym possessed me.
    582859|00000000||He's as much courage as Cerys, but she's got somethin' else - wisdom and cunning.
    582861|00000000||Tis a good outcome.
    434488|00000000||Young an Craite on the throne - it's like the helm's been handed to a dockside vagrant. This is bad.
    434490|00000000||Clearly what Destiny wanted - not for us to judge.
    439683|00000000||I piss on Destiny. We're talkin' about the Isles, not some sword in a pond!
   1050105|00000000||Gotta admit, I didn't think you could help us…
    422532|00000000||Greetings. Wanna look over our stock?
    422534|00000000||Take it everything here's for sale?
    422536|00000000||Sure, if you can afford it. The Jarl's a stickler for quality so we keep no rubbish here.
    422538|00000000||Zerrikanian zefhars, Mahakam battle axes, Viroledan short swords… Where'd you get so many Continental goods?
    434397|00000000||The sea provides.
    434401|00000000||And if it doesn't provide on its own, you hack off hands that hold swords in a death grip?
    434431|00000000||Haha! D'you think we just find all this on the shore, like seashells at low tide?
    422552|00000000||Show me what you got.
    422476|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    422554|00000000||Can you craft something for me?
    422478|00000000||Need you to craft something for me.
   1086488|00000000||What would you say to a round of gwent?
    422556|00000000||So long.
    422482|00000000||Farewell.
    422480|00000000||What else do you bring back from raids?
    422542|00000000||What else do you bring back from raids?
    422550|00000000||Essentials, mostly - fancy wines, silks, valuables of all sorts.
    434541|00000000||Oh, and wenches. If we don't make proper use of 'em, who will?
    436842|00000000||Heard of Hollerin' Hulda, known as the Hellraiser, Madman Lugos' wife? Or Goldilocks Sanza, world's most beautiful maid in her time? Taken in raids, both.
    422540|00000000||Lookin' for somethin' specific?
    573092|00000000||It's no shame to lose to a Skelliger. We ride our mounts like we ride the waves - calm and smooth as cream atop butter.
    573088|00000000||And the winner is… witcher Geralt of Rivia!
   1049125|00000000||Such a feat deserves a reward. Here… May it remind you of your glory.
    583798|00000000||Well… Didn't expect an outlander to win all three. You've one Pursuit left - the most important. You'll face a true master o' the chase. It's on Hindarsfjall. Suggest you get goin'.
   1024495|00000000||Will you be much longer?
   1024497|00000000||If you plan to watch over my shoulder, yes, it'll be a great while yet.
   1024499|00000000||This is no time to be snarky, Vilmar. Budworms and weevils have infested every pine on Spikeroog, and that--
   1024501|00000000||That means we need pesticide, I know. But it doesn't grant you the right to act like a pest yourself.
    382182|00000000||Thanks, take care.
    382184|00000000||Good luck searchin'!
    430789|00000000||I'm looking for Cerys.
    430791|00000000||The skinny thing? Lovely doe eyes, true, and she's from an honorable house - but the lass is gaunt as a sapling.
    382177|00000000||I don't know where she is, and her father…
    500841|00000000||Bah, tell Crach to calm down. No Skellige lass can perish in her own isles.
    382180|00000000||All right. She was here a few hours. Went to find me man, Eiric. Needed to talk, she said. They should be on the beach t'other side of the isle.
    382171|00000000||I'm looking for Cerys.
    382173|00000000||Lovely, you say? Can I meet 'em?
    382200|00000000||Did you say lovely girls? Where? Maybe one'd be willing to show me around the island?
    382202|00000000||Well, there's Veya, lovely one, cooper's daughter. Though… nah, she's got teeth like fish-hooks.
    382281|00000000||Now Debora - there's a fine lass, teeth bang on straight. Though, there is a growth under her right eye…
    382283|00000000||Hmm... Maya's got a right dreamy face! If not for that bit of bone rot in her right foot…
    382293|00000000||Argh, nuts! Now I give it a think, well, none of these lasses are really appealin'!
    347491|00000000||Greetings. I'm looking for someone.
    347493|00000000||Lucky chap you are, then! Truth be told, I'm taken. But village is brimmin' with lovely girls!
    379646|00000000||I'm looking for men from Undvik.
    424333|00000000||Javor's from the isle. And I once cut those waters with nary a rest. Could trace you the shoreline in me sleep.
    521956|00000000||A lovely excursion, if not for the bloody sirens…
    521934|00000000||I'm the one to ask! Me or Axel an Tordarroch. He's over there. What can a bloke from Ard Skellig know about Undvik?
    521945|00000000||Heard you trillin' a different tune when Hjalmar was gatherin' his crew… Your love for the an Craite fade that quick?
    521964|00000000||Bahumum…
    381077|00000000||Need to get to Undvik.
    412649|00000000||Another thrill seeker. Well, then listen close, lest you end in a watery grave.
    381079|00000000||Sail out of port and head southwest. Watch for rocks protrudin' like pricks out the water - you'll have to do some tricky tackin' to get past them.
    422219|00000000||Some of them's shorter, just below the surface, so careful not to scrape right over them. They breech your hull, you're done for, 'cause just a few minutes in that icy water makes a corpse. One time I remember--
    422221|00000000||Stick to the point.
    417784|00000000||Err, um, fine. Watch for the currents, 'cause they can drag you off course, dash you 'gainst the rocks, even. With a bit of luck, you'll land on the same beach where Hjalmar landed.
    417994|00000000||Gotta get to Undvik.
    426331|00000000||You mentioned sirens. Many on Undvik?
    426333|00000000||So, soo many. More'n on other isles.
    521985|00000000||Bollocks…
    424327|00000000||Once, they attacked Lars and me when we was fishin'. 'Fore we could drive 'em off they'd pulled Lars in the water and scratched me up so bad that… oi!
    424323|00000000||Drive away the sirens? How's that work?
    521987|00000000||Hah! Plain to see you're no islander! With a hornwall's horn. One toot and they ploughin' scurry off so quick the waves rock your boat.
    418059|00000000||You mentioned sirens…
    380739|00000000||Nice talking to you, but time I was on my way. So long.
    415193|00000000||Fair winds to you!
    417999|00000000||Need to go.
    417996|00000000||Why didn't you go with Hjalmar?
    391938|00000000||Javor's from there, or so he claims, and you seem to know these waters. Why didn't you sail with Hjalmar?
    391940|00000000||Cause that kind of expedition needs a true leader. And a whelp lookin' to collect bumps on his skull can only be its doom. Once I--
    391942|00000000||… you'd rather sit on your arse, nose in the air, you Zerrikanian princess?! Brave lad comes along, you sail with 'im!
    424339|00000000||I'd 'ave sailed with Hjalmar if only those sea-whores hadn't banjaxed my knee. Woulda sailed 'stead of sharin' a table with a grumpy barnacle like you.
    522165|00000000||You'd sail with anyone who'd let you aboard - Crach's daughter included.
    413885|00000000||Wind blew you in again, eh?
   1023194|00000000||Blooms are late. And there are very few bees…
   1023196|00000000||Fierce frosts we had this winter. Half the hives on Spikeroog failed to last until the thaw.
   1023198|00000000||Do you think the White Frost is nigh? That the prophecies are true?
   1023200|00000000||Hard to say… But one thing is certain: spring comes later every year.
    582960|00000000||A weak lass, nothin' more.
    582962|00000000||When Nilfgaard strikes, she'll hide her tail 'tween her legs. There'll be no glory, there'll be no loot.
    582964|00000000||Her brother, he's the one should be wearin' the crown.
    582989|00000000||I've been awaitin' this day.
    582991|00000000||That's no idle talk from Hjalmar. We're like to strike at Nilfgaard before the next new moon.
    582992|00000000||May they be as fierce o' foes as folk say.
    582993|00000000||Glory to him who defeats them. The skalds will surely immortalize him in song.
    158473|00000000||Get out of here! The whoreson's mine!
    158475|00000000||Shut up, you idiot…
    501349|00000000||When'd the gods speak to you? Right after I left?
    501355|00000000||Shortly after. Sleep came over me, so I lay down. 'Twas then they revealed their will to me.
    501357|00000000||You always asleep when they speak to you?
    501373|00000000||Always.
    501375|00000000||What do you see then? Do they try to summon you anywhere specific?
    501379|00000000||My old home. They command me to light torches, then speak from the shadows.
    493286|00000000||When'd the gods talk to you?
    493285|00000000||What did the gods say? Exactly.
    493288|00000000||What'd the gods want? Exactly. Do you remember? What'd they tell you?
    493289|00000000||They were angry.
    493294|00000000||A voice said, "You vile wretch. You didn't help Aki, and now you failed to sail out to beg his forgiveness."
    493292|00000000||"Poke out your eye. Suffer, and regret the evil you've wrought."
    488309|00000000||What's wrong with him?
    488311|00000000||Can we talk somewhere in private?
    488313|00000000||The guest room. Come.
    488266|00000000||I returned the sword, but nothing's changed. It's not his brother's ghost that haunts him, tortures him.
    501459|00000000||Cerys, we need to talk.
    501396|00000000||The gods speak from the shadows, you said. Is that why you don't allow any lights in here?
    501399|00000000||In my dreams. Atimes I see their form. When the torches burn bright.
    501423|00000000||To see the gods is a great honor. Maybe, with more light in your house, you'd see them when you're awake as well?
    501424|00000000||Lesser men are unworthy, they cannot gaze upon their faces.
    501390|00000000||The gods don't like light?
    501426|00000000||The gods always demand you offer them your suffering?
    501428|00000000||Only that pleases them, so they ask for more and more.
    501391|00000000||Do they always demand an offering of pain?
    501394|00000000||Have you ever seen them?
    501445|00000000||The gods ever show you their form? Or are they always just a shadow?
    501446|00000000||Once, I steeled myself, gathered my courage, and in my dream made my torch burn bright. I saw a hazy figure sitting in shadow then.
    488240|00000000||Why'd you do it?
    488243|00000000||Such was… the will of the gods. A sacrifice… for Aki.
    485895|00000000||What is this?
    485896|00000000||Udalryk… The voices commanded him to poke out his eye.
    488209|00000000||What?
   1024524|00000000||Oi, those herrings stink somethin' awful!
   1024525|00000000||Hehe… If it bothers ye, why'd ye become a fisherman?
   1024527|00000000||Me da fished, as did his da, and his da's da… Just sorta happened.
   1024528|00000000||Well, I've no family tradition o' that kind… But I do know this: only dead fish swim with the current.
    330618|00000000||Mff. Here. Mead spiked with some kind of mushroom… and… human blood?
    585630|00000000||Cerys! Come here.
    575324|00000000||No other willin'? What, are you all afraid? Nothin' to fear! Bones heal and skin scars over!
    575326|00000000||Remember last year - Yove and his horse flyin' right off that cliff?
    575327|00000000||Aye, aye… Lad died young. 'Twere somethin' beautiful, though.
    575329|00000000||Grab your bridles and hang on to your saddles!
    575332|00000000||Ride on! For Freya!
    575336|00000000||No one can outrace Speedy Osvald!
    575334|00000000||Keep your distance, vagrant!
    575338|00000000||Hahaha! I won!
    575340|00000000||Hahaaaa! First again!
    575406|00000000||Damn!
    457320|00000000||Horrid… So many dead… The flower of Skellige youth.
    587987|00000000||I've told you my thoughts already.
   1028786|00000000||How about you take a break from hawking, we play cards, instead?
   1028785|00000000||How about some cards?
    421280|00000000||So long.
    421276|00000000||Farewell.
    421274|00000000||Lemme see what you have.
    421278|00000000||Lemme see what Hotspur brought in.
    421272|00000000||Greetings. You're in luck - Ejlof Hotspur's longship made port yesterday, so we've fresh goods.
    582896|00000000||Well, the lass showed 'em all!
    582898|00000000||Long live Queen Cerys!
    582900|00000000||May a whale swallow me whole if he proves a bad king!
    582902|00000000||Long live King Hjalmar!
   1070690|00000000||What is this about?
   1025592|00000000||Ugh, stinks of carrion. Necrophages?
   1025599|00000000||Siren tracks. A very big siren.
   1025609|00000000||Strange scale color… Not your everyday siren.
   1025612|00000000||Hmmm, an ekhidna.
   1042144|00000000||Drowners couldn't possibly lift Nils into the air.
   1053430|00000000||Same scales as on the altar.
   1053441|00000000||Melusine cult didn't appear outta nowhere. Ekhidna's been living here a while.
   1053443|00000000||Went into hibernation some time ago, but it's awake now. And it's hungry.
   1053516|00000000||Oughta explore those caves Britt mentioned.
   1053437|00000000||Melusine, the mad and dangerous lady of the depths.
   1054024|00000000||Clearly used to be worshiped here.
   1042996|00000000||So now Hjalmar will go after the Black Ones…
   1042998|00000000||Svanrige's Bran's blood, won't let the Black Ones live!
   1043000|00000000||Black Ones wouldn't be on Undvik if we'd a man on the throne, as it should be.
    395577|00000000||Ah. Look.
    395579|00000000||Akh akh…
   1042994|00000000||Ye came to our isles, ye saved us from the giant.
    395571|00000000||A newcomer.
    395575|00000000||Wanderer?
    395573|00000000||Where's your road wend?
    395581|00000000||Save me!
    395585|00000000||Death! Death!
    395583|00000000||Help!
    537074|00000000||Oh, the many times the sea drenched me and froze me thorugh to me marrow…
    540209|00000000||Twas the jarl put the bun in 'er!
    540211|00000000||They strutted into the village and raped our lasses.And Holger was among 'em!
    540215|00000000||I'm tellin ye, lost his eye in a tavern brawl, not on no raid.
    540213|00000000||Really? Really??
    540217|00000000||Don't know what to think anymore…
    540509|00000000||Think you can find a way out of it?
    540511|00000000||Aye, 'course.
    537076|00000000||Gods be with ye.
    537078|00000000||Careful now.
    537080|00000000||May me lad find fame and glory.
    537082|00000000||Whatcha got there?
   1009981|00000000||Cerys.
   1038759|00000000||Do somethin' 'bout that tower… We're all countin' on ye…
   1044172|00000000||So, what's the matter?
   1038626|00000000||See that knoll beyond the village? Weren't a thing there for centuries, till one day we awoke, and bam! There were a tower atop it!
   1038630|00000000||Then all a-sudden lightnin' started poundin' down, as if the Naglfar itself were sailin' in. Hasn't stopped to this day.
   1038632|00000000||Somethin's gotta be done - about the storm! With waves like that we can't fish nor sail out to raid.
   1018577|00000000||Hemdall guide you.
   1044174|00000000||Once you're in, cast your eye around for the folk from our village - our druid and five good lads. Ah, it'd be a bitter shame to lose 'em.
   1044176|00000000||You have my word.
   1018575|00000000||Fine. I'll look into the tower.
   1018572|00000000||Fine. I'll look into it.
   1041584|00000000||You tried getting inside the tower?
   1041586|00000000||Have we tried? Very same morn the tower appeared! We went right off, whole village or nearabouts!
   1041594|00000000||Folk wanted to welcome its owner, if he come in peace, drive him off if he come with ill intent.
   1041588|00000000||We knocked and banged, but no one answered. So we opened the door. An' that's when our knees turned to jelly.
   1041590|00000000||Why?
   1041592|00000000||Cause beyond of that door was somethin' like… a sheet o' water, but standin' upright. Never seen such a thing in me life!
   1041596|00000000||Druid said it were magic. Gathered five brave lads and they all marched in. No sign of 'em since.
   1041566|00000000||Tried entering the tower?
   1030796|00000000||Magic towers - not what I do.
   1030798|00000000||Give it a think, please. We've none other to turn to.
   1018573|00000000||Sorry, not interested.
   1040296|00000000||What's the problem?
   1040298|00000000||Remind me - what's the problem?
   1040300|00000000||Ye blind? Storm's aragin', waves as big as huts, and to top it all, there's lightnin' crashin' all about!
   1041574|00000000||And all this since that magic tower appeared. Somethin's gotta be done!
   1019449|00000000||Oh, you return. So - the tower? Anythin' to be done?
    421324|00000000||I'd like you to craft something for me.
    459274|00000000||If besides the likin' you've got some gold, too, then we're in business.
    421322|00000000||I'd like you to craft something for me.
   1086485|00000000||Interested in playing cards.
    421294|00000000||So long.
    459272|00000000||Fair winds and followin' seas!
    421288|00000000||Farewell.
    421286|00000000||Show me what you got.
    421292|00000000||Show me what you got, then.
    421290|00000000||From barrel hoops to blades - I've got it all.
    499341|00000000||But I'm guessin' you're more interested in blades.
    587870|00000000||Any apparent motive?
    587876|00000000||What was her motive?
    587893|00000000||It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
    587895|00000000||If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
    561384|00000000||A hidden compartment…? Hm, maybe oughta try Arnvald's key?
    561381|00000000||A letter. I told you!
    569150|00000000||Smell it? Birna's perfume…
   1070535|00000000||It was her after all…
    569151|00000000||Never liked it, horribly suffocating. Might've guessed it was her.
    587869|00000000||Let's read the letter already.
    587902|00000000||Read that letter already.
    587904|00000000||Instructions on how to spike the mead… Some promises. But it's neither signed nor sealed.
    589926|00000000||Think it's enough?
    587908|00000000||It's got to be. We shouldn't delay any longer. Time to gather the jarls.
    585852|00000000||Too bad she didn't set her official seal to it…
    585850|00000000||Didn't have to. Look - a hair.
    392737|00000000||Either nosy or plain deaf.
    393616|00000000||Kill 'im.
    551415|00000000||Brrr, could go for some hooch. Warm me innards.
    550391|00000000||Lamb born in the village on the bay's got two heads, six legs but just the one cooter!
    550393|00000000||Pshaw…
    550395|00000000||Do I hear right? You mean to give up you trade?
    550397|00000000||Me master's always sayin', "Stick to hammers and anvils, lad."
    551441|00000000||Favorable winds to ye!
    551443|00000000||Eeeh?
    551452|00000000||Me, I've got nothin' to say…
    551439|00000000||At your service!
    551445|00000000||Foreign lad. Well, well.
    551417|00000000||Some go bald, others go gray.
    551447|00000000||Hey now…
    551449|00000000||Wanna give us a scare?
    551450|00000000||By Hemdal! Run!
    576618|00000000||Geralt of Rivia… I've been awaiting you.
    576620|00000000||Show 'im, Astrid! We believe in ye, lass!
    576621|00000000||The vipress'll swallow the wolf!
    576623|00000000||Go on! Ride swifter than the wind and the goddess' own chariot!
    576626|00000000||They're off! They're off!
    576630|00000000||Grrr!
   1063430|00000000||Keep your distance, drifter!
    576628|00000000||Out of the way! Or I'll kill ye!
   1063432|00000000||Hahahaha! I won!
    576632|00000000||Hahahahaha! I won! Second year in a row!
    481267|00000000||C'mon, come closer, don't be afeared. You're sure to win.
    481268|00000000||Every man defeats Ulle the Unlucky. You will too.
    481266|00000000||Oh, another. Here to defeat the Ghost of the Arena? Be my guest.
    523464|00000000||Behold - who do I spy? Could it be a challenger for Olaf?!
    523465|00000000||Fight! There's gonna be a fight!
    523466|00000000||Bit of a milksop, ain't he?
   1023275|00000000||You've still a stain on the sleeve, Lukka. You're not scrubbin' hard enough.
   1023277|00000000||Another word and I'll scrub your ploughin' mouth out.
   1023279|00000000||A werebear bite ye? I'm tryin' to help, gettin' nothin' but grief in return.
   1024830|00000000||Me little Norgunn's birthday's the morrow… and I've no clue what to give her.
   1024832|00000000||Maybe a nice axe, pretty like?
   1024834|00000000||An axe? Are ye serious?
   1024836|00000000||Why not? I'd like it.
    491288|00000000||Faster! Faster, they're catchin' up!
    491300|00000000||Watch out! They're right behind you!
    498231|00000000||Ride, Ciri! Don't look back!
    335796|b2cf5c31||Eredin
    495773|00000000||Never knew a man as brave… and as god-fearin'.
    495774|00000000||I feel shame… Don't know I'd be able to make that kind of sacrifice.
    495775|00000000||Praise Udalryk! There is no greater jarl than him!
    439012|00000000||Our time amongst the living is but the wink of an eye.
    439014|00000000||What's left when we are gone?
    463449|00000000||How shall we be remembered?
    463451|00000000||Will they speak of us with respect?
    463453|00000000||Or disdain?
    439016|00000000||Bran was a great man. We shall remember him as a hero.
   1024695|00000000||Not a sail on the horizon. We get fewer pilgrims every year.
   1024696|00000000||You surprised? Folk say Freya stopped heedin' our prayers when we let her garden fall into ruin.
   1024722|00000000||The gods avert their gaze, wraiths descend from the sky on the Rainbow Bridge… Ragh Nar Roog is nigh.
   1024724|00000000||Idle chatter. You've been sayin' that for thirty years, and we still live - though we're worse off, as fewer pilgrims mean less business.
    589744|00000000||Hah! Got him!
    166803|05b6c502||Druid
    477233|068721d7||Slave
   1086145|e5e26ccb||Ice Troll
    432590|d184d9f7||Wraith
    582939|00000000||Lugos was furious…
    582941|00000000||That one's always furious…
    582944|00000000||Rarely like that, and he's rare to leave.
    582946|00000000||Mark me, no good'll come of it…
   1055581|6affaf85||Hegel Grossbart
   1025134|00000000||Didn't I say we'd see Crach's offspring on the throne? Eh?
   1025136|00000000||And now we'll see Lugos at the gates of Kaer Trolde, just you wait… He'll not let this go.
   1049921|00000000||We'll welcome him. With arrows and boiling oil!
    414075|00000000||Then the cockatrice sank its claws in me arm… But I held fast to me sword and sliced its maw!
    582500|00000000||Aye, well done… But what's that compared to Hjalmar? He killed a giant.
    582502|00000000||With another's help.
    582504|00000000||No shame in havin' a good crew.
    582506|00000000||Hjalmar had a mercenary at his side.
    582508|00000000||Ah. That's another story.
   1041550|00000000||What is it?
   1039905|00000000||I got a job for ye. There's no point standin' here in the rain. Let's go to mine, we'll talk there.
    416092|103ab9ab||Bear
    585757|00000000||We…. We killed the King of the Wild Hunt!
   1001592|00000000||Nothin' to celebrate. Bugger always comes back.
   1001474|00000000||See it? The razorback... clear up high?
   1001475|00000000||Eh, too big for a razorback. That's a blue.
   1001476|00000000||A blue? With that short a snout? Herbs've robbed you of your senses!
   1001482|00000000||Hey, look! Flying fish!
   1001485|00000000||What's strange about that? See them at sea every few crests…
   1001486|00000000||Aye, but those, they got wings! These here…? It's as if they're swimmin' through the air!
   1001491|00000000||Kill one monster, another crawls out… So is this yours, this a witcher's nightmare?
   1001492|00000000||Nope. This is daily life for us.
   1001493|00000000||I see the way out! Follow me!
    550832|00000000||Told the old bag not to hang the wash today.
    550265|00000000||So he says, "You forge armor, and I'll cobble boots." Maybe we'll make a go of it?
    550267|00000000||You a fool, or just feignin' it?
    550269|00000000||Tell me, would you take that order from Holger?
    550271|00000000||Great Freya's tits!
    550834|00000000||Good day.
    550836|00000000||Ahh, it's you.
    550838|00000000||Swords need thumpin'?
    550848|00000000||Mind your manners.
    550840|00000000||Agh. Agh. Agh.
    550850|00000000||What crack did you crawl out of?
    550842|00000000||Watch it!
    550844|00000000||Nice. Now put it back in its scabbard.
    550846|00000000||Gods!
    422416|00000000||How are things? Business good?
    422418|00000000||Why wouldn't it be, seein' as I make the best arms in the Isles?
    499521|00000000||Just look - iron ore from the bowels of Mount Ard Faand, where giants once tore up the earth. Then my forge fire, blazin' unbroken for six generations, it's care passed from father to son.
    499523|00000000||And everyday come dawn, Hara, my youngest, she pricks her finger and squeezes a drop of her blood into the water I use to temper the blades.
    422426|00000000||Hm. Lemme have a look.
    422402|00000000||What do you have in stock?
    422428|00000000||Like you to craft something for me…
    459323|00000000||What? My wares not good enough?
    459325|00000000||Relax… They're fine, just not what I need.
    459327|00000000||Foreigners and their fancies… Fine, show me what you want.
    499531|00000000||Got a job for you.
    422404|00000000||I'd like you to make something for me.
   1086476|00000000||Gwent - willing to play?
    422438|00000000||So long.
    459329|00000000||Smooth sailin'.
    422408|00000000||Farewell.
    422406|00000000||What's new in Fyresdal?
    422430|00000000||Anything new in Fyresdal?
    422432|00000000||New? Nothin'.
    422436|00000000||This ain't the Continent, fashions don't change with the meltin' snows. We live like our fathers and grandfathers lived - fishin', huntin', and raidin'… And so shall we live, to Ragh nar Roog and beyond.
    422414|00000000||You're back.
    421262|00000000||What do you druids deal in these days?
    421258|00000000||Got anything to sell?
    421264|00000000||Farewell.
    421260|00000000||Farewell.
    499331|00000000||Know any master alchemists?
    499333|00000000||Looking for someone who'd know some master alchemist formulae.
    499335|00000000||Then you're looking for Gremist. Never heard of anyone who would know more about plants and their attributes than he.
    499337|00000000||Where can I find him?
    499339|00000000||Here, in the grove. He's got a grotto. But Gremist's… well, he's a tad eccentric. And he stopped taking on apprentices ages ago.
    421256|00000000||Welcome to the Sacred Grove.
    574713|00000000||Stead o' chattin', pray to the goddess. Ask her to grant ye victory… or at least let ye survive.
    574715|00000000||Freya smiled upon another today. Not surprisin'… she rarely looks kind on outlanders.
    574718|00000000||Make Freya an offerin' in gratitude. A black mare'd be best. Or a foal with a blaze on its muzzle.
    397891|00000000||Leshen's territory begins here. Need to destroy all the totems before I find the beast.
    392492|00000000||This is the place. Need to find and destroy all the totems.
   1024735|00000000||Remember Olaf swearin' he'd seen a man change into a bear?
   1024737|00000000||Mhm. Sjarri locked him in the outhouse. Said, "You'll sit there till you sober up." A barrel o' laughs, that…
   1024739|00000000||Last laugh woulda been Olaf's… if the berserkers hadn't ripped off his head.
    382277|00000000||You heard? Crach wants three new longships ready by summer.
    382279|00000000||Why's he want so many? He's a fleet already, more'n enough for a raid!
   1049963|00000000||Might have fleet enough for raidin' a nunnery or a village… But not for war.
   1049965|00000000||Means to sail against the Black Ones, ye think? Encroach on their waters?
   1049967|00000000||Crach has more gray hairs every day… I think he wants to leave the scalds somethin' to sing about.
   1022685|00000000||Seen the plans? Strange longship we're buildin'. Bottom's almost flat… and but a two foot draught.
   1022687|00000000||By Hjalmar's command. He aims to sail this up the Yaruga, plunder Sodden. Yaruga's a shallow river.
   1022689|00000000||Sure, but you gotta cross the sea first! And this thing'll sink come the first storm!
   1022691|00000000||I said the same. But Hjalmar wouldn't listen. He says, "I'll die famous, or come back a rich man. Either way's good."
    374148|7e613e3d||Bjorg
    591192|00000000||Well? What do you want?
    591193|00000000||To help you, drifter.
    591194|00000000||Know how to escape?
    591195|00000000||Escape? Nay. But there's other ways out - I can ensure Lugos'll try you today.
    591197|00000000||You'll be free sooner… or go under the axe. Either way, out today.
    591219|00000000||You're back. Like I said you'd be.
    593146|00000000||What did happen at Fyresdal?
    593152|00000000||So what happened at Fyresdal?
    593157|00000000||None o' your concern. Just go to him, repeat what I said.
    593148|00000000||They say every prisoner's got a secret. But you, Simun, seems to me you've got a bundle.
    593150|00000000||Fine. I'll do as you say.
    593145|00000000||All right.
    591221|00000000||Sounds good.
    591225|00000000||Tell the guard to take you to Lugos. Tell him he does that, Simun'll forget what happened at Fyresdal.
    591212|00000000||Sounds good.
    593118|00000000||If you can get the guard to do that, why're you still in here?
    593120|00000000||Argh, you don't know Simun Brambling.
    593122|00000000||Many seek my death. I'm safe from their vengeance here… And the time for mine's not yet ripe.
    593108|00000000||Why don't you get out, then?
    591213|00000000||Never liked owing favors.
    593114|00000000||Rather not be anyone's debtor.
    593116|00000000||Prefer bein' a prisoner, then? As you will.
    591214|00000000||Think I'll manage on my own.
    591215|00000000||Or you'll be back.
    591200|00000000||Be fine on my own.
    591199|00000000||Go on.
    591208|00000000||Go on.
    591209|00000000||Owes me a favor, one of the guards. I can get 'im to take you to Lugos… Then you can owe me a favor. Whaddaya say?
    591220|00000000||So what'll it be? A favor for a favor?
    591156|00000000||Psst! Whitehair! C'mere!
    591154|00000000||Look at 'im cast his eyes about, searching for an escape. But there ain't none to be found - heh! - save for talkin' to old Simun.
   1017964|00000000||You step outside the ring, you lose - got it?
    509646|00000000||I want to fight you.
    511982|00000000||Why me, exactly? Askin' outta curiosity, given you're a foreigner.
    511987|00000000||All right. Jutta said she'd fight me if I defeated you.
    509647|00000000||Jutta said that?! Means that if I win, she'll give me another chance!
    511992|00000000||Well, come on, then. Let's do this!
    509631|00000000||Wanna fight you.
    509636|00000000||So long.
    509633|00000000||Farewell.
    509632|00000000||Heard you fought Jutta.
    509634|00000000||Heard you fought Jutta.
    509635|00000000||And she bested me. But there's no dishonor in losin' to her. Though it is a shame…
    509641|00000000||Why?
    509642|00000000||Twere a fair fight, one worth rememberin'. But if I'd won, I could've presented her an altogether different sort of challenge.
    509643|00000000||Hm, seemed a little unapproachable to me…
    509644|00000000||Heheeh. She awaits a man she can't defeat. In fact, she's declared that only a man who beats her can hope to woo her.
    509645|00000000||Interesting way to look for a husband.
    511970|00000000||I'm not sure it's marriage she's after.
    511972|00000000||Argh, a lass like that's one in ten thousand!
    511974|00000000||You Gundar?
    509612|00000000||Aye.
    165638|00000000||Lady Yennefer. Sir.
    515916|00000000||Greetings, Arnvald. My companion is Geralt of Rivia.
    515918|00000000||I am honored.
    515923|00000000||Nice to meet you, too. Quite a few guests.
    515925|00000000||They come to bid their king farewell. They come to see the claimants to the crown.
    515921|00000000||Nice to meet you.
    515920|00000000||Where can we find Crach?
    539016|00000000||We wanted to talk to Crach an Craite.
    465669|00000000||The jarl will join us shortly. He's assigned you a place of honor at the table, just beside his daughter, Cerys.
    465671|00000000||Follow me, please.
    496776|00000000||Geralt, watch out!
    445603|00000000||Great.
    492619|00000000||Remember when that storm caught us in Olls Bay?
    495905|00000000||Aye, like it were yesterday! Ofgunn fell overboard and near drowned!
    496034|00000000||Udalryk dove in the waves and saved 'im!
    492621|00000000||Twas the gods directed him. He said their voice commanded him to dive into the maelstrom.
    496041|00000000||Too bad they didn't protect him from harm. Cut his shoulder to the bone. Wound then festered for a month.
   1021336|00000000||Take a gander! My first expedition to the Continent, and just look at the tankard I brought back!
   1021338|00000000||Ooh, not bad… Can near fit three pints.
   1021340|00000000||And so fancy! Decorative paintin' all over.
   1021342|00000000||That's no tankard - that's a bedpan, you fool. For shittin' in.
   1021344|00000000||Haha! Got yourself a new nickname! Olaf Shit-Gulper!
    550723|00000000||Ehhhhh.
    550190|00000000||Half a jug of busthead in one gulp! He was that terrified!
    567961|00000000||But he'd looked a griffin in the eyes and lived… So I'm not surprised.
    550186|00000000||One survived the Lofoten massacre, but only 'cause he fled just afore the attack!
    550187|00000000||Fled. Can you imagine?
    550188|00000000||Musta been a sight…
    550192|00000000||Well, I'll be!
    550214|00000000||Think they've enough ore?
    550216|00000000||Iiiiii dooooooon't knooooooow.
    550725|00000000||Greetings.
    550731|00000000||Swords are for wenches. Get yourself an axe.
    550741|00000000||And a sword cross his back 'stead of an oar…
    550727|00000000||Sun could do me a favor - not rise on the morrow.
    550729|00000000||Hmm?
    550739|00000000||What is it?
    550733|00000000||Fuckin' hell!
    550735|00000000||Eh?
    550737|00000000||Help! Good folk!
   1024592|00000000||Where we sailin' on the next raid?
   1024594|00000000||Kovir, Pont Vanis or Lan Exeter. Depends how the wind blows.
   1024596|00000000||That's damn far.
   1024598|00000000||But worth it. Ain't nowhere's got riches like the true North.
   1070217|00000000||Here's the nest…
   1070219|00000000||Hm, not much left. Beast must've dragged the shredded body to the woods.
   1070221|00000000||Creature leading the nekkers is sentient, gotta be.
   1071420|00000000||Capable of setting primitive traps, at least.
   1070223|00000000||Hm, a nekker hunting alone? You rarely see that.
   1070225|00000000||Seems the nekkers've developed an immunity to the toxin. Now the poison protects their nest. Clever.
   1070227|00000000||Finally. The main nest…
   1070215|00000000||Sverre and his crew were attacked here. Should look around.
   1071058|00000000||Merciful Freya, mother of ours!
    509651|00000000||You win.
    509652|00000000||Ugh, a moment longer and I'd 'ave given up.
    512018|00000000||Thanks for the fight, White One.
    509653|00000000||Gonna try your luck with Jutta again?
    512021|00000000||Course! But, uh, uh… I think I'll wait till the morrow.
    509648|00000000||All right! Enough!
    509649|00000000||You fight well.
    509650|00000000||Not well enough. Good luck with Jutta!
    353024|00000000||Ermion is chief druid here?
    353028|00000000||Ermion's head of the Skellige circle? Haven't seen him since… hmm…
    353030|00000000||Since Ciri was a little girl.
    515844|00000000||I doubt he'll do you any favors. Not even for old times' sake.
    389313|00000000||As far as Velen's concerned…
    389181|00000000||Didn't learn much in Velen. Ciri wound up at the home of a local baron. She also quarreled with some witches.
    389189|00000000||That's about all I've learned.
    389319|00000000||Good. You'll need to tell me more when we have some time.
    389187|00000000||Also ran into an old friend of ours in Velen - Keira.
    390137|00000000||What on earth is Keira Metz doing in that wasteland?
    390139|00000000||Hiding from witch hunters. Listen, she told me an elven mage had been there, looking for Ciri.
    389185|00000000||These witches Ciri came across - she was lucky to escape them.
    536452|00000000||Witches?
    536453|00000000||Creatures, more like. Can't say exactly what they are. But they're dangerous. Very.
    389530|00000000||Velen - awful place. Somehow Ciri wound up at the castle of the local ruler - a baron, self-proclaimed. This was after she was injured.
    390129|00000000||Injured? Was it serious?
    389532|00000000||Don't think so. Must've recovered, because this baron sent her on to Novigrad. Think she was looking for you at the time.
    389183|00000000||I'm not done searching in Velen yet.
    390133|00000000||Thought you'd tend to that immediately.
    390135|00000000||Change of plans.
    389315|00000000||As for Novigrad…
    389578|00000000||Been to Novigrad. Ciri was there, looking for a way to lift some curse. She's not there anymore.
    390141|00000000||You're certain?
    389580|00000000||Heard it from Dandelion - with no embellishments.
    524231|00000000||Do you know any more about this curse?
    524233|00000000||Not much. Ciri ran into some trouble, never finished what she went there to do. I recovered a phylactery - she was looking for a way to enchant it.
    524235|00000000||I'll look at it later.
    389381|00000000||That's everything.
    389383|00000000||They robbed one crime boss and almost killed another…
    524277|00000000||Ciri was looking for something. She needed coin and information.
    524280|00000000||That's all I know at this point. Gotta find Dandelion, talk to him.
    389385|00000000||So Dandelion knows what happened to Ciri?
    536328|00000000||Yeah. Gotta find him.
    389329|00000000||Dandelion got them in trouble. Ciri made an enemy of Whoreson Junior, one of the city's crime bosses.
    389327|00000000||Ciri found Dandelion in Novigrad. They met up.
    389323|00000000||Haven't looked around Novigrad yet.
    459155|00000000||Came straight here. Haven't looked around yet.
    459169|00000000||Actually, I don't have anything solid - about Velen or Novigrad.
    459171|00000000||I was hoping you'd have learned something by the time you arrived. But, since you haven't, we'll start our search in Skellige.
    464277|00000000||You look beautiful.
    464279|00000000||Thank you. Nice to see you again.
    464285|00000000||The eulogy.
    464287|00000000||King Bran of Clan Tuirseach has embarked on his final voyage. At its end, our glorious ancestors await him. Together they will hunt and raid.
    464289|00000000||They will sit 'round the fire and praise the deeds of ages past.
    464291|00000000||For now, he lives in our hearts. One day, we too shall stand at his side and face the sea together.
    464293|00000000||That will be a good day.
    464305|00000000||You smell wonderful.
    464307|00000000||Geralt - we're at a funeral.
    464309|00000000||You smell wonderful at this funeral.
    464297|00000000||You smell wonderful.
    464295|00000000||You knew Bran?
    464299|00000000||You knew Bran?
    464301|00000000||Yes. He was well respected.
    464303|00000000||Unlike his wife.
    464321|00000000||Skellige is its clans. In times of war, tradition holds the clans unite under the leadership of their king.
    464323|00000000||We've bid Bran farewell. Time to pick his successor, who will lead us against the Black Ones.
    464325|00000000||The gates of Kaer Trolde stand open to all who held Bran of Clan Tuirseach dear. Mead and meat will be plentiful.
    464327|00000000||During the wake, those who believe themselves worthy of the crown will step forth.
    464331|00000000||Not in the mood for a wake.
    464339|00000000||Hope we don't have to go to this wake.
    464341|00000000||Well… We don't have to go…
   1075899|00000000||Feasts in Skellige - so predictable. Slobbering drunks, brazen boasting, and the inevitable rows that result…
   1075901|00000000||Yeah, nothing like the banquets mages attend. Remember the one on Thanned?
   1075903|00000000||You were there - how could I forget? I also remember excruciatingly well what happened after the banquet.
    464333|00000000||Come to the wake with me?
    464335|00000000||Gladly.
    464329|00000000||Go to the wake with me?
   1075897|00000000||Wanna run away with you, spend some time alone.
    464369|00000000||Haven't seen each other in two years. I want a solitary cottage by the sea. I wanna lock myself inside with you, stay there for a week.
    464371|00000000||What would we do there for a week?
   1075906|00000000||Got so many ideas…
   1075908|00000000||The one with the rope you use for trophies, that one seems interesting.
    464606|00000000||Stop reading my mind.
    464608|00000000||Something to hide?
    464610|00000000||Don't like secrets?
    464612|00000000||No.
    464562|00000000||Really hate it when you read my mind.
    464560|00000000||Reading my mind?
    464592|00000000||Reading my mind again?
    464594|00000000||Mhm. What's more, I like what I see.
    439738|00000000||Did you learn anything in Velen?
    477834|00000000||What've you learned?
    377108|00000000||How about you? What've you learned?
    439740|00000000||Something strange happened on Ard Skellig a time ago. A disaster brought about by a burst of magic. Extraordinary, really, a natural anomaly. Never seen anything like it.
    439746|00000000||My intuition tells me Ciri was its cause.
    439750|00000000||As much as I respect your intuition, Yen, we need something specific, evidence.
    439752|00000000||I'd know for certain if I was able to inspect the disaster zone. Unfortunately, Ermion and his druids aren't letting anyone near.
    353026|00000000||Why won't they let you examine the zone?
    353032|00000000||So why won't Ermion let you inspect the area of the anomaly?
    353034|00000000||Call it a difference of opinion. A large, loud difference.
    515846|00000000||Look, it's Crach.
    464617|00000000||White Wolf!
    464619|00000000||Greetings, Crach.
    464621|00000000||I shall see you at the wake. And I'll not accept any excuses - I've an important matter to discuss with you.
    515848|00000000||I shall wear black and white for the feast. I count on you to don something complimentary. Something that doesn't reek of a thousand hunts.
    515859|00000000||Yen, you know I can't stand new doublets. Just too tight till you break them in…
    515861|00000000||And just like Crach, I'll not accept any excuses. We're not here to enjoy ourselves - we've matters to resolve and should dress appropriately.
    515863|00000000||I've rented a room at the inn. Took the liberty of laying out some clothes for you there. You ought to go, choose something. In the meantime, I've something to attend to. We'll meet at the entrance to the feast hall.
    464628|00000000||Guess our solitary hut will have to wait. Crach an Craite's someone we want on our side.
    371754|00000000||You need not do this, child.
    371756|00000000||I know. But I want to.
    371758|00000000||Tis madness, such a young lass…
    371760|00000000||Birna should be the one goin', they shared a bed longer.
    371762|00000000||Silence. 'Tis her decision.
    166305|00000000||Calm yourself, Holger. You're drunk as a seaswine.
    172093|00000000||Got to kill Donar.
    435888|00000000||Why? Wherefore?
    435890|00000000||Can't remember. But I knows he deserves it. I got to kill 'im.
    172095|00000000||You will. Later.
    172097|00000000||Fine. I'll get his wife, too.
    172099|00000000||His wife is dead.
    172101|00000000||So I'll wait till he weds anew…
   1024600|00000000||Torgun, what're ye gonna do in this big house? They're not comin' back. You're alone.
   1024602|00000000||Stead of fixin' it, move in with me, in Larvik. Would it be that bad, livin' with your brother?
   1024604|00000000||It would. I'd forever be seein' your wife in the kitchen, your daughter at the loom… and thinkin' of my Duva and Edla.
   1024606|00000000||Leave me, go back to your girls. And never let 'em outta your sight.
    393620|00000000||No one special.
    393630|00000000||Just a traveler. Happened to be passing through.
    393632|00000000||Thanks for your aid. If you'd not come by, we'd 'ave been done for.
    393634|00000000||Lugos'll wonder what happened to his men. What'll you do?
    393636|00000000||Don't worry about us. Send my boy off to Kaer Trolde, hasty like. The jarl's not like to let Lugos off. You'd best watch your own back. Lugos finds out, he'll try to get even.
    393638|00000000||Think I'll manage. Good luck.
    393628|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher.
    393618|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
    393622|00000000||Who were they?
    393624|00000000||Bandits. Madman Lugos' men.
    393626|00000000||And who are you, my good man?
    385814|00000000||It's the work of the Spirit! He warns us again!
    385816|00000000||Arnulf's dead. This is no time for your bollocks.
    386467|00000000||Dead, aye! And it's your doing!
    386469|00000000||Dead because the woodland beast killed him.
   1002149|00000000||Rurik, right? Heard you were on a boat the drowners attacked.
   1002150|00000000||Aye, I was. With Ulf, me cousin, gatherin' our crab traps off the Kjerag Cliffs. Ulf was pullin' up a line, havin' a hard time of it. Grand, I thought, cage's gotta be full, it'll be a good haul... Then somethin' tugged back... and down. Weren't a blink and Ulf was underwater.
   1002152|00000000||I called after 'im. Once, twice, thrice… Then the water went red with blood and I smelt somethin' horrid, rotten... but worse. Then the muire d'yaeblen flipped the boat. Don't even know how I made it ashore. Must've had Freya watchin' o'er me!
   1039801|00000000||That… or the monsters had eaten their fill… Thanks for the story.
   1021726|00000000||I missed yesterday's fight. I hear Gjord of Larvik fought Mighty Edvin?
   1021728|00000000||Edvin ain't so mighty no more… Gjord snapped both his arms. Can't even piss without a helpin' hand, now.
    481130|00000000||What happened to the garden?
    481232|00000000||What… what happened to the garden?
    481234|00000000||It died. Like I said… The spell, it requires a great deal of energy.
    481236|00000000||You knew it would end like this, didn't you? Didn't consider it worth mentioning?
    481238|00000000||No - I knew you'd protest. Your sense of decency is charming, but it does get in the way sometimes.
    481131|00000000||How are you feeling?
    481215|00000000||Yen… are you all right?
    481219|00000000||I'm splendid. I'd feel even better if I hadn't had to remind you to ask that question.
    481180|00000000||I'm fine now. The spell…
    481182|00000000||Imagine putting wriggling cockroaches in your mouth… Or swimming in manure. That's more or less how it felt.
    481244|00000000||Geralt, I know we should talk… But not here, all right? I don't wish to stay a moment longer.
    481336|00000000||I'm sorry.
    497586|00000000||I'm sorry.
    497588|00000000||Is that all? Will you say nothing else?
    497590|00000000||Nothing that would help.
    482158|00000000||I shall make sure all Skellige hears what you did here.
    482160|00000000||Wait… I did this. I alone. Geralt tried to stop me… I refused to listen.
    482162|00000000||I might have known. They warned me about you…
    497600|00000000||Sorceresses…
    497584|00000000||None shall open their door to you, none shall feed your hunger, and none shall tend to your wounds.
    481461|00000000||We had no choice. We'd never have learned what happened to our--
    481463|00000000||Do you really think you're justified?! That your hunt for a foreign woman gives you the right to destroy our garden?
    497582|00000000||I'm sure it doesn't in your eyes.
    481335|00000000||We had no choice.
    481263|00000000||The garden… Our garden!
    481265|00000000||How could you…? We helped… and you-- Inconceivable.
    481279|00000000||Now, now…
    481334|00000000||Don't you dare try to calm me. We've every right to be furious. Furious! And you… You will pay for this.
    481240|00000000||Yen… let's get out of here. Now.
    481242|00000000||You needn't ask me twice.
    481133|00000000||Let's get outta here. Now.
    481132|00000000||You could've shown a little sympathy.
    481158|00000000||Could've shown some sympathy for the boy. He--
    481160|00000000||That was no boy, Geralt. It was a hunk of rotting, rancid flesh that spoke through my magic.
    481161|00000000||Didn't just speak. It howled in pain.
    481170|00000000||I know it seemed real… But it was no longer human. Do you understand?
    481217|00000000||Nice of you to be so concerned for the corpse. Much more than you were for me.
    478898|00000000||What became of that creature? Where is he?!
    478903|00000000||Sssss-tooo-pp…. Hhh-urrrr-tsssss…
    481092|00000000||What?!
    481094|00000000||Ssss-aawwwww hhhh-iii-mmm… aaaa-tt…. Dddd-ooo-nn-aarrrr-sss… Bbb-uttt… hhh-eee… sss-ooo-lllddd… hhh-iii-mmm…
    481096|00000000||To whom?!
    481098|00000000||Ddd-ooo-nnn't… Knnnn-oowwww…
    478904|00000000||Begone.
    478905|00000000||Ttt-eelll… thhhh-emmm… Ccc-llleeearrrr… mmm-yyy… nnn-aaa….
    481102|00000000||Begone I say!
    481128|00000000||Aaaaaaach!
   1032585|00000000||In days past the gods, not the jarls, chose the king.
   1032596|00000000||Think the gods would've seen Svanrige's strength?
   1032598|00000000||I think they know he'll make a good warrior. As he'd 'ave made a good king.
   1032600|00000000||Svanrige could be king yet. These're uncertain times…
   1051630|00000000||Out of the question, Simun. I'm no murderer. Not gonna kill him.
   1051632|00000000||Then you'll die - at his side.
   1051620|00000000||Outta the question. I'm no murderer.
   1051636|00000000||Nothing personal, just paying a debt.
   1051638|00000000||Honor demands it, I get that… but it don't mean I'll ease your task any.
   1051846|00000000||Nothing personal, just paying a debt.
   1051619|00000000||What'd he do to you, Simun?
   1051998|00000000||What'd he do to you, Simun?
   1052001|00000000||Me?! To him?! 'Twas him who did me wrong! Whoreson killed me brother… Tricked him. Betrayed him. I swore revenge, hunted him across all the isles. Bugger always got away somehow. Till now, that is…
   1052003|00000000||High time we end this strife. Once and for all. No more questions, Geralt. Cut him down.
   1051608|00000000||Knew you were thick, Brambling, but that thick? To waltz into me… Who the hell's this?
   1051610|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. A witcher.
   1051612|00000000||He's come to kill ye.
   1043450|00000000||His new captive woman, she's from Nilfgaard, you know.
   1043452|00000000||From Nilfgaard? And you let her share his bed?!
   1043454|00000000||He wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole! Just gives her a good lookin' over atimes.
   1043456|00000000||Says that when he looks at her real close, he hates her so much he's gotta scream.
    166032|00000000||Feasts at Kaer Trolde are legendary. Axe tossin'…
    375987|00000000||Tamed bears…
    166034|00000000||Jarl Crach's cellar's stacked high with barrels of the best mead in these Isles.
    375989|00000000||He's not exaggeratin'! Ard Skellig mead'll knock anyone on their arse, tamed bears included!
    416770|dc3b3b65||Clan An Craite Elder
   1050491|7ef171cd||Hound of the Wild Hunt
   1049218|00000000||You won, aye, shan't deny it. But go brag to someone who don't know already.
   1049216|00000000||If you're lookin' for someone to cheer ye up, you've chosen badly.
   1049214|00000000||Think they call me the Vipress 'cause I'm pleasant to talk to? Outta my sight, foreigner.
    434427|00000000||The Goddess bless and sustain our new king.
    434429|00000000||Good has been wrought. The Goddess chose her.
    572035|ec9b08eb||Blacksmith
    495190|00000000||Whaddaya know about this garden?
    495191|00000000||Let me think… That it's dreadfully overgrown.
    498021|00000000||Had its history in mind.
    498023|00000000||They say Freya herself planted it. When the world was young the goddess strode across Skellige, sowing seeds among the rocks. But Uroboros, the snake, bit a hole in her basket.
    498025|00000000||All her seeds poured from it and landed here. Thus, this garden is bounteous, while the rest of Skellige is barren.
    498027|00000000||You believe that?
    498029|00000000||Is that a serious question? Of course not. Favorable microclimate for plant life, end of story.
    495183|00000000||What do you know about this garden?
    498031|00000000||To transform into a werewolf… It's a dog's life, eh?
    498033|00000000||Well, there's not a youth out there who doesn't have a wolf in his belly.
    498035|00000000||Then the curse confined him to this garden? Couldn't really cut his wolf loose.
    498037|00000000||No question he was top dog here…
    498039|00000000||Just wolfin' things down… or not.
    498041|00000000||Geralt… That's enough, hm?
    498043|00000000||Fine. Still had a few good ones at the tip of my tongue.
    498045|00000000||I'm sure you did. We'll say you won.
    497977|00000000||Transformed into a werewolf… it's a dog's life.
    497950|00000000||All right. Going back down.
    497953|00000000||Be careful.
    495187|00000000||See you.
    495184|00000000||I found a body… But it wasn't Craven's.
    495199|00000000||I found a corpse… not Craven's, though.
    495200|00000000||Aha. And you thought I'd find this interesting because…?
    492557|00000000||Because… no bite marks on it… Doesn't seem strange to you?
    491370|00000000||Zerrikanian cuisine, Dandelion's fame and shoes with curly toes seem strange to me, yet I don't discuss them with you.
    497963|00000000||Reading between the lines here - think I'm wasting your time?
    497965|00000000||I mean merely that we should focus on what's most important at the moment.
    491373|00000000||Why would it? I thought that's how the curse worked… Morkvarg is ever hungry, yet cannot eat.
    497979|00000000||Yeah, but… what about the other wolves?
    497981|00000000||Unless… they refused to touch the food before the leader of the pack did…
    497983|00000000||Well, now you've solved that fascinating riddle, perhaps you can return to looking for Craven? Hm?
    495180|00000000||Well? What is it?
    170368|00000000||Die, dammit!
    163525|82f44f11||Ice Giant
    390946|00000000||It's Hilde.
    392118|00000000||The leshen's marked Hilde.
    392120|00000000||Hildie?
    390388|00000000||You could exile the marked one.
    390691|00000000||No one needs to die. The marked one should leave the village, that's enough. If they never return, the leshen'll never be reborn.
    390693|00000000||Did you hear what the witcher said? We've but to banish the elders to have peace for all time!
    390842|00000000||It's not one of the elders.
    390932|00000000||Who, then?
    390934|00000000||The woman you were talking to.
    390936|00000000||It's not one of the elders.
    390938|00000000||It's Hilde.
    390940|00000000||The leshen's marked Hilde.
    390942|00000000||Hilde?
    390966|00000000||We must banish her. Said so yourself.
    395297|00000000||But… she's one of us!
    393590|00000000||For the good of the village, Sven.
    390968|00000000||...Drive her out. Make sure she knows she's not to return. Ever.
    393602|00000000||Killing the leshen won't be easy. Stay out of my way while I hunt.
    393604|00000000||Go to your homes, stay inside. If I don't come back, send someone to Kaer Trolde.
    393606|00000000||We'll do as you say. Don't let us down, witcher.
    393594|00000000||Now I can kill the leshen.
    393592|00000000||You won't go with her, Sven?
    393596|00000000||Not going with her? Funny, thought you cared for her.
    393598|00000000||Tend to your own affairs and leave me to mine.
    393600|00000000||I did what I had to do. Now it's your turn.
    393106|00000000||Thought you liked the girl.
    393108|00000000||I did what I had to do. Your turn.
    390972|00000000||Kill the witch!
    390974|00000000||Hilde? But she's one of us.
    390976|00000000||No mercy, Sven. We all heard you.
    390978|00000000||...Take her.
    390948|00000000||Never said the beast marked one of the elders.
    390950|00000000||Who, then?
    390952|00000000||The woman you were talking to. Hilde.
    390944|00000000||It's not one of the elders.
    390687|00000000||If you want me to kill the leshen, you gotta get rid of the marked one.
    390689|00000000||Do you hear the witcher, people?!
    392052|00000000||If we wanna live, we gotta slaughter the elders! No mercy!
    390386|00000000||You have to get rid of the marked one.
    393092|00000000||So? Find out who's mates with the beast?
    393094|00000000||It's not intentional, the marked individual has no idea.
    393096|00000000||You don't know the elders like I do. Every last one of them codgers would surrender his mother to please the monster.
    395299|00000000||And no point in mincin' words. Said yourself, the monster's helper must die first.
   1086180|06c8b791||Javor
   1000400|00000000||So? Did it work?
    492049|00000000||It did. Your son should recover soon… And Jonna will die.
    492050|00000000||Thanks, witcher. A thousand times over. Me son's dearest of all to me. I couldn't abide it if he'd died.
   1072827|00000000||Your reward. Will ye eat with us before movin' onward?
    492051|00000000||No. Not in the mood.
    172329|52a3f146||Peasant
    492416|00000000||Your lads. They…
    492417|00000000||What about 'em? Speak, dammit!
    492418|00000000||They're dead. At some foreigner's hand.
    492419|00000000||Kori… Kraki!
    583369|00000000||Ate only the entrails. Fussy.
    583370|00000000||Ran this way…
    583371|00000000||Crossed to the other side.
   1034885|00000000||Yellow tunic… Must be Olve.
   1034887|00000000||Huh, the Faroe boys were right after all. There was treasure in the ruins…
   1034889|00000000||No Olve here. Maybe the fiend dragged him off…
   1039017|00000000||A fiend.
   1039049|00000000||Came this way, toppling trees.
    583368|00000000||Fang and claw wounds all over the body… but those indicate feeding. He died from a blow to the head.
   1056704|00000000||Kaer Morhen's got a pretty rich library.
   1056706|00000000||I shall search that later. Besides… we really should report to the emperor.
   1056690|00000000||I shall scour the palace library for something, anything that might help us determine who… or what the creature Skjall saw is.
   1056674|00000000||We must report to the emperor, after all.
   1056676|00000000||Ciri's our concern, and only ours.
   1056678|00000000||At heart, perhaps. But it's not what we agreed with Emhyr. We must see him.
   1056684|00000000||Awfully loyal of you…
   1056696|00000000||Awfully loyal to your patron…
   1056698|00000000||He happens to be your patron as well, darling. You'd do well to remember that. Otherwise he might feel compelled to remind you.
   1056692|00000000||Don't have the slightest intention of doing that.
   1056694|00000000||Well. I can't force you..
   1056682|00000000||I refuse to report to him.
   1056680|00000000||So be it.
   1056686|00000000||If we gotta, we gotta.
   1056688|00000000||We wouldn't have known Ciri had returned if not for the emperor and his agents. It's the least we can do.
   1018589|00000000||If you gotta go, go.
   1009080|00000000||Fine… If you gotta go, go.
   1018607|00000000||Please, Geralt. There's nothing left to say.
   1009131|00000000||I'm off. See you, witcher… Somewhere on the Path.
   1056672|00000000||I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from him, then we'll ride for Kaer Morhen.
   1009054|00000000||I shall join you as quickly as I can.
   1009789|00000000||See you, Yen. Take care of yourself.
   1009129|00000000||I'll see you again soon.
   1009787|00000000||Take care of yourself.
   1018611|00000000||So long, Yen.
   1056700|00000000||I'm off.
   1056702|00000000||Me too. I'll collect Uma from the baron, then we'll ride for Kaer Morhen.
   1009060|00000000||I shall join you as quickly as I can. Farewell.
   1009046|00000000||It shan't take long.
   1009052|00000000||Better not.
   1018609|00000000||…was very nice. Let's not ruin it by hashing out the details.
   1018591|00000000||Yen, what happened back there…
   1018588|00000000||Let's talk before you leave.
   1007344|00000000||Next time we go on horseback.
   1009012|00000000||A horse would never make it down that mountain.
   1009777|00000000||What now?
    587147|00000000||Well, I'm due to appear in Vizima.
   1077257|00000000||Thanks, mate. Fayrlund - you know the place? I've me forge there. Come and visit, I'll have a reward for ye.
    347454|00000000||Svalblod! Svalblod! We summon thy power!
    400357|00000000||I told him, I says, "Don't enter the wood."
    400359|00000000||Why'd he want to, anyway?
    400361|00000000||Blackberries - wanted to pick some.
    400363|00000000||Oh, he went lookin' for death.
   1056306|00000000||Why can't I play today, da?
   1056308|00000000||We've got to go to the port, bid farewell to King Bran. It's not fittin' to play, Agnet.
   1056310|00000000||Who'll be king of Skellige now?
   1056312|00000000||None know that. But the gods'll make sure it'll be one worthy, one before who it'll be no shame to bow our heads.
   1056314|00000000||A king's passing - there's an occasion worthy of a new song!
   1056316|00000000||A year now you've promised to write somethin' for me.
   1056318|00000000||Any old hack can write a song for a lass. Not so when you've to commemorate the death of a king!
   1056320|00000000||Didn't write one lousy word for me while the king were alive.
   1058721|00000000||This here's my chance, don't you see?! This one ballad could make me Clan Tuirseach's court skald.
   1017957|00000000||Wound on his back… He was running away.
   1017962|00000000||Almost managed to find cover. Almost.
   1018051|00000000||Ordinary specter… Killing it won't change a thing.
   1018052|00000000||Hey! Anyone there?!
   1018089|00000000||A penitent…? Good thing it hasn't appeared to me yet. Couldn't possibly kill it in this mist and darkness… Need that lighthouse working again.
   1019158|00000000||A letter…
   1019159|00000000||Well, well. Lighthouse has got a pretty dark secret.
   1020916|00000000||Ahh, no reward again. Gotta go to Arinbjorn. Could be a reward for the penitent there.
   1037542|00000000||Walls're covered in ash… No other signs of a fire, though.
   1037550|00000000||Hurry up! Don't know how long I can manage this!
   1037634|00000000||Light. Finally… Time to get this done.
   1017956|00000000||Mhm. Not your average mist.
    501341|00000000||Ye strayed from the path, witcher. Means you lost.
    501342|00000000||Froze me arse off for nothin'. Fuck this, let's go warm up with some mead.
    392383|00000000||You Odhen?
    392385|00000000||I am. Here about me sonny?
    392412|00000000||Been to the ruins. Your son's band - a fiend attacked them. They're all dead. Sorry.
    392414|00000000||I told him, told him! Sonny, nothin' good can come of it, stay with your pa. Time for adventures'll come later!
    393656|00000000||Take this… For avengin' him, at the least. And I'll pray… pray you never have to bury your own child.
    392405|00000000||How'll I recognize him? All I know's he doesn't listen to his father. Pretty typical for his age.
    392407|00000000||His name's Olve. Cheerful lad, bit of a lisp. Nothin' special 'bout his looks… 'Cept last I saw him he was wearin' a yellow tunic. Lovely, none other like it in the village. Got it from me a year back on his birthday.
   1034690|00000000||That oughta do it. I'll look around… No promises, though.
    392401|00000000||Where should I look for your son?
    392403|00000000||East o' here, 'midst the ruins of the fortress. He went there with some rogues from Faroe, met 'em at the tavern. They filled his head with nonsense 'bout some treasure. I said, "Sonny, Faroe folk are liars to a man, ye shouldn't fraternize with 'em"… But he knew better.
    392395|00000000||Where should I search for your son?
    393650|00000000||Sorry, can't take this on right now. Farewell.
    393646|00000000||Sorry, busy at the moment.
    511012|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
    511014|00000000||Let's talk about my reward, first.
   1068399|00000000||What? Master… Can't rightly believe Crach's got that in his coffers!
   1068401|00000000||Have mercy on an old man. Drop your price a few crowns.
   1068405|00000000||It's a lot… I'll need to borrow from kin. But you have it. Won't spare no coin for me boy.
   1068407|00000000||I don't care to bargain. Take what I offer, or I'll find another to look for me lad.
    392530|00000000||What is it?
    392532|00000000||You're clearly a fightin' man with many journeys 'neath your belt… I'm in need of your help. You see, it's me sonny, I'm worried. Left home a fortnight back and hasn't returned… Will you see what's become of 'im, would you mind?
    393703|00000000||Greetings…
    506409|00000000||Shh…. Guards.
    506411|00000000||Hide behind the tapestry.
    520600|00000000||Sparrows chip, while starlings chirp.
    520602|00000000||What do jackdaws do?
    520604|00000000||Jackdaws caw.
    520606|00000000||Goldfinches warble and cranes whoop, whereas peacocks screech.
    520608|00000000||Hawks scream, larks trill, and doves, they coo. That's all of 'em.
    520610|00000000||Hmm… What about nightingales?
    520612|00000000||Ah, right. Nightingales croon.
    375497|00000000||Let's look around.
    495747|00000000||Can't help wondering what that accomplished, if anything. Time to see Udalryk.
    429005|00000000||Geralt! Come! Think I've got an idea!
    375511|00000000||Geralt!
    585264|00000000||Three years. Three fuckin' years, pickaxe in hand.
    585265|00000000||Know why he's keepin' us so long? Wants to build a new tower. Needs a lotta stone for that.
    585269|00000000||Wonder if you'll be as deft with a pickaxe as y'are with a sword.
    585266|00000000||You, drifter. Where'd you get your scars?
    589643|00000000||Hey ho, hey ho, to fuckin' work we go.
    589644|00000000||Tellin' you we'll hit a cave one of these days. Make our escape.
    476565|00000000||Well? Ready?
    480915|00000000||Use the Mask.
    370755|00000000||Don the Mask.
    382295|00000000||Who might that be?
    382297|00000000||Ye blind? Plain to see it's a witcher.
    382299|00000000||A monster slayer, eh? What's it doin' here?
    382301|00000000||It's a friend of the jarl's, maybe come to visit.
    428093|4fb3e93b||Pirate
   1022727|00000000||They say Lugos is fixin' for a fight. And not with the Black Ones, but with us.
   1022729|00000000||If he breaks the truce, he'll prove himself the madman we all call him.
   1022731|00000000||And if that lad o' his crosses my path, he'll truly be a blue boy.
    374500|00000000||Pardon, I'm looking…
    314102|00000000||Busy here, can't you see?
    349802|00000000||Went well, I thought. Maybe ye'd consider workin' together for a spell? Seems you've a gift for this kind of work.
    349804|00000000||Thanks, once is enough. So long.
   1049346|00000000||Lotta loot to carry. Not sure I can do it without a boat…
    376003|00000000||Damn, something's seriously wrong here…
   1028222|00000000||Fine, I'll look around for them.
   1028210|00000000||I'll help.
   1028220|00000000||We've all got problems, I'm no exception. Sorry, can't help you.
   1039200|00000000||I understand, should never 'ave bothered ye. I'll go meself.
   1039202|00000000||What about the wedding preparations?
   1039204|00000000||Won't be any weddin' if I don't bring Agda here. I should go.
   1028211|00000000||Sorry, don't have time.
   1028208|00000000||What's the matter?
   1028209|00000000||Me betrothed and me brothers… Mikkel and Ulf sailed to Hindarsfjall. To fetch Agda, wedding's in but a few days. But they've yet to return.
   1073395|00000000||A storm broke while they were gone. I fear it might've blown 'em onto the rocks at Faroe. Many've lost their lives there.
   1039193|00000000||I'd sail out to find them, I would, but I've got to make sure the wedding's proper prepared.
   1039195|00000000||They say it's not fittin' for a Skelliger to ask for aid, but I've no choice - will ye help me? Will ye seek out me kin?
   1010416|00000000||Got some bad news… Sadly, Agda's dead. So are your brothers…
   1010419|00000000||Wh… what? How? What're you sayin'?
   1010420|00000000||A storm destroyed their boat - Agda was killed. Your brothers felt they'd let you down, couldn't live with the shame… They chose death.
   1014527|00000000||Found this letter. Might help you come to terms…
   1010421|00000000||A letter? That all that's left of 'em?!
   1010424|00000000||Also found your fiancé's dowry. Small comfort, but still…
   1014536|00000000||Thanks. Few men would be so honorable. Fare ye well.
   1010422|00000000||Found this chest with her dowry.
   1010423|00000000||I have nothing else.
   1010427|00000000||Sorry, didn't find anything else.
   1010465|00000000||I've nothin' left in this life…
   1018952|76c3e800||Highlander
    587685|00000000||That all you got?!
    587684|00000000||Ugh… blisterin' barnacles…
    587682|00000000||Hah! Bled like a stuck whale!
   1046182|00000000||Last one. Drag the corpses outside, burn 'em. Other ghouls don't scorn their cousins' corpses.
   1046184|00000000||Aye, true.
   1046186|00000000||It's good ye came. Seems Freya watches o'er us to 'ave led ye here. We're grateful, and will be for long.
   1046188|00000000||Ahem. Folk're generous with gratitude, not so much with coin.
   1047130|00000000||Oh, aye. Sorry, uh, afterglow o' the battle, we're still caught up. Damn, you slice 'em good! Here, for you.
   1052140|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
    575263|00000000||Ah, it's you. First outlander to seek a place in the Heroes' Pursuits. Will ye ride here, too? There's room for ye if ye want.
   1049141|00000000||If your arse is a tough as your talk, who knows…
   1049139|00000000||Listen up, folks! Race is about to start! Runnin' for the glory o' the Great Mum are Speedy Osvald, Lonelyboy Svan and Geralt of Rivia!
    575269|00000000||Yeah, yeah, I'll ride. Might even win.
    575266|00000000||I'll ride.
    575268|00000000||Maybe some other time… So long.
    575267|00000000||Maybe some other time.
   1049137|00000000||Geralt… Will ye join the race? Others're waitin' already.
   1073339|00000000||Did I kill Steingrim in 201?

    424505|00000000||Greetings.
    424507|00000000||What d'ye want?
    424509|00000000||Someone's in a good mood…
    424511|00000000||What mood would you be in if you'd lost your son…? So, I'm askin' - what d'ye want?
    424525|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
    459508|00000000||So be it…
    424517|00000000||What do you offer?
    424527|00000000||Like you to craft something for me…
    459510|00000000||Fine, show me… It's easier somehow when I've work to do…
    424519|00000000||Need something crafted.
   1028788|00000000||How about a few rounds of cards? Gwent, specifically.
   1086487|00000000||Let's play cards.
    424533|00000000||Take care now.
    459516|00000000||Mhm.
    424523|00000000||Farewell.
    424521|00000000||What happened to your son?
    424529|00000000||Your son - what happened to him?
    424531|00000000||Drowned… Finback tipped the boat he was on. Were his first journey into northern waters…
    459512|00000000||Sorry to hear it.
    459514|00000000||Sea swallowed his body… I'll not bury him, he'll not feast with his ancestors.
    424535|00000000||Eh? What is it?
    421564|00000000||Got a diagram. Willing to craft something?
    421550|00000000||Willing to craft something?
   1086492|00000000||Maybe we could play gwent.
    421566|00000000||So long.
    421552|00000000||Farewell.
    421548|00000000||Show me what you have on offer.
    421562|00000000||Lemme have a look.
    421560|00000000||Greetings. If you're in need of a weapon, I'd be glad to forge somethin' for you.
   1038418|00000000||You all quiver in your breeches as if Ragh nar Roog were upon us. 'Tain't but a tower!
   1041541|00000000||We should assemble all warriors and go for glory, I tell ye.
   1038537|00000000||And disappear like the others? Not a chance. The tower's cursed! It's brought the gods' wrath upon us!
   1038541|00000000||Cursed, magic, what-fuckin'-ever. We need someone to rid us of it, plain and simple.
   1041543|00000000||Look, a witcher. Oi! Witcher!
   1050048|00000000||Nothin' quite like a witcher.
   1023148|00000000||Ugh, my arm's sore from all this choppin'… How's it there's so many drowners here?
   1023150|00000000||They say Sprightly Holm sank a longship full of slaves here. Near a hundred men.
   1023152|00000000||One was sick. The pox, most like. Infected the others, so they weren't fit for sale. You understand.
   1023154|00000000||Well, now they're back with a vengeance, the bastards.
   1047241|00000000||Hold me back, 'cause I can't bear it no more!
   1047243|00000000||What is it?
   1047245|00000000||Those an Craite whoresons're spreadin' rumors! About some gray git from the Continent crackin' Lugos' skull!
   1047247|00000000||Calm down, it's piss in the wind, and it'll soon fly back in their faces.
   1047239|00000000||Remember when the roofs o' Kaer Trolde burned? Now that was pretty.
    421590|00000000||Don't sell herbs.
    499546|00000000||That's too bad. Unusual biotope here. Never seen most of these plants. Bet they have amazing properties, too.
    499548|00000000||You know plants?
    499550|00000000||I do.
    499552|00000000||That grass with the wide blades…?
    499554|00000000||Hinny sorrel - breaks fevers.
    499556|00000000||And that-there thistly one?
    499558|00000000||Umm… thistle?
    499560|00000000||Well done. You can look over me stash.
   1028755|00000000||Trade's good and all, but I'm hankering to play some cards. Gwent, specifically.
   1086464|00000000||Gwent - let's play.
    421598|00000000||So long.
    421594|00000000||Farewell.
    421592|00000000||Lemme have a look.
    421596|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1077465|00000000||Ah! There he is! My keeper, my savior! I'm with my kin again, thanks all to you.
    499562|00000000||You're back? Good.
   1021367|00000000||How could he. Three sons I gave him. All healthy lads.
   1021369|00000000||Pull yourself together. You'll not be the first woman to share her man with a captive.
   1021371|00000000||I'll throw myself in the sea first.
   1021373|00000000||Ule… What're you sayin'?!
   1021375|00000000||The truth. I may be a woman, but I've got me honor!
   1040280|00000000||Quickly! Follow me! We must neutralize the Mask, mute its power!
    560766|00000000||He fled…
    560767|00000000||Get back to the castle. I'll try to track him down.
    560768|00000000||I'll wait by the stables.
    587647|00000000||Blood and mardroeme. The taste of human flesh and a substance that triggers visions. That well could've caused the rage, maybe even the transformation.
    588317|00000000||Maybe. Hard to believe someone spiked the mead here in the hall, though, in front of all those witnesses.
   1070356|00000000||You're right. I helped prepare for the feast… I'd 'ave noticed.
    587681|00000000||It might've happened before they brought the drink upstairs. In the cellars, maybe?
    588320|00000000||C'mon. We could find some clues there.
    585826|00000000||Mardroeme. Never heard of it.
    585828|00000000||You've another name for it on the Continent. Psilocybe, I believe?
    585830|00000000||All right. Peasants eat it to soothe pain.
    585832|00000000||Udalryk tried it, too… but only a few times. In larger doses, the mushroom causes visions, nightmares.
    585833|00000000||Yes, the last thing Udalryk needed more of. Thanks for your help.
    585823|00000000||Mardroeme? Never heard of it.
    585841|00000000||Cerys wasn't lying. You know your fungi.
    585842|00000000||I do. Especially those which affect the mind, soothe it, summon waking dreams.
    585919|00000000||Udalryk suffered for years. I tried to help him in various ways. Initially with prayer, then with poppy milk.
    585921|00000000||But he's done with that now, right?
    585923|00000000||It's not that simple… But we'll wean him off it yet.
    588313|00000000||Cerys wasn't lying… you know plants.
    585824|00000000||Mardroeme have anything to do with berserkers?
    587602|00000000||Mardroeme related in any way to berserkers?
    587604|00000000||Aye… But only in the tales told to children as they're put to sleep on cold winter nights.
    588315|00000000||Warriors who ate mardroeme were said to transform into beasts when consumed by battle rage. But as I said, it's only…
    587622|00000000||Only a legend, I know. Still, I find it easier to believe than some story about bears appearing out of nowhere.
    585714|00000000||Freya, our mother, may the sea swallow the traitors. Freya, our lady…
    585716|00000000||Mind if I interrupt?
    585718|00000000||Already have. What is it?
    585720|00000000||Someone spiked one of the mead barrels. With blood and something else, an herb or a mushroom. Cerys said--
    585722|00000000||Give me the horn.
    585822|00000000||I know the smell. A mushroom - mardroeme.
    410032|00000000||You fight good… For a Continental.
    410034|00000000||Go. 'Fore I squeeze you 'tween me fingers like a tick.
    572969|00000000||You've not spent much time in the saddle, have ye? Your legs're too straight.
    572971|00000000||You lost. What's there to say?
    572974|00000000||I've raced since I was a lad… But I've never seen nothin' like that. Sure showed us.
    452728|af91b76f||Ghoul
    375674|a7315004||Freya Priestess
   1049068|00000000||*Sigh* Eh, I want to know already what it is we'll face…
   1049070|00000000||Erynias? Trolls? Some other beasts?
   1049072|00000000||If it's Hemdall's will that we be warriors, we'll pass the trials.
   1049074|00000000||And oblivion to those who prove unworthy.
   1054136|00000000||Loot's grand! Enough to drink and plough the whole winter away at taverns.
   1054138|00000000||We'd do better to stay here, wait things out.
   1054140|00000000||Wha? 'Ere? It's damp… and dark…
   1054142|00000000||Which is why no one'll come crashin' in on us.
    376129|00000000||Sharpened its claws. Or just marked off its territory.
    376131|00000000||Long claws. Downright impressive.
    376133|00000000||Strangled its prey. Then started feeding.
    376135|00000000||A strangler. Strange - didn't consume its prey.
    376647|00000000||Smashed bones - that takes strength. No point in trying to parry its blows.
    376649|00000000||Smashed bones. Damn, it was strong.
    376662|00000000||Bruises. Beaten to death. No sign of fangs or claws.
    376664|00000000||No cuts, no bite marks. Just bruises.
    379569|00000000||Thin and deep cuts. Not unlike a razor…
    379571|00000000||Long, sharp claws, this one…
    381774|00000000||Rips apart its prey like a striga.
    411223|00000000||Hair turned completely gray. Scared witless, probably.
    381776|00000000||Damn. Ripped to shreds.
    382080|00000000||Where'd the sirens come from?
    382086|00000000||Seen sirens around here before?
    382088|00000000||Aye, 'course. They fly in from Undvik, the isle cursed by the gods. Damned she-beasties…
    382090|00000000||But enough chatter, me brother awaits. Thanks for the help, stranger. Your gods grant ye health.
    382082|00000000||You did. Where'd you learn to shoot?
    382084|00000000||Hah, you won't believe it when I tell ye! Right here, out at pasture. The she-beasts of Undvik come to steal our sheep, so we gotta manage somehow.
    382078|00000000||Yeah, you showed them.
    379458|00000000||They hurt you badly?
    379460|00000000||I'm fine. I really showed 'em, didn't I?
    572935|00000000||Wanna chat, go to a tavern.
    572953|00000000||Gray hair, pale mug, ugly as shite… but ye sure can ride, witcher.
    572949|00000000||You on the Continent have not got our speed. You fear it.
    442902|00000000||Our forebears forbade all from worshippin' Svalblod. On pain of death.
    587658|00000000||What?! Where'd you--
    442906|00000000||From Kaer Trolde. Bet you know why we're here.
    442928|00000000||Aye. On a matter that's naught to you, mutant. A matter of pride and honor.
    442940|00000000||Didn't see any honor in what happened at Crach's castle. That was a massacre, plain and simple.
    584415|00000000||You see in darkness, yet are still blind.
    587661|00000000||We spilled that blood for Skellige. For a king we can be proud of.
    587663|00000000||Don't give a damn about your motivations. Gimme a name.
    587666|00000000||I'd sooner die than tell you.
    442932|00000000||Nothing honorable in that massacre.
    442930|00000000||All yours, Hjalmar.
    443134|00000000||True, not my concern. Hjalmar, he's all yours.
    443140|00000000||I could just butcher you like a swine… but I'll let you die with honor. Defend yourself!
   1037636|00000000||L-look! There! It's him!
   1017634|00000000||I see it. Now shut your mouth and go light the fire. Remember - you fail, the penitent'll kill me. Then come for you…
   1023168|00000000||The constant sound of axes and saws, the air thick with the smell of sap…
   1023170|00000000||The jarls are building new longships. It's the way of things. Trees are always the first to fall in a war.
   1023172|00000000||Do they even how long a yew grows to maturity? That if they cut them all down, they'll have to wait two generations for more?
   1023174|00000000||You think they give a stink about the future? To them, Ragh nar Roog will come before two generations pass.
   1045390|00000000||What eat you?!
   1045392|00000000||Goulash of nekkerses. Much onion.
   1045394|00000000||Mhhh, onion rotty must be.
   1045413|00000000||*Fllllrrrrp*
   1045415|00000000||Uman scared! Plug bunghole! With finger!
   1045417|00000000||Uman no, supper no.
   1023417|00000000||It true what they say? You let a Black One go free on the last raid?
   1023419|00000000||He was but a young lad. Younger than my Eric. As I raised my sword, he broke out sobbin'… I just couldn't!
   1023421|00000000||Young, you say? Even worse. He'll go back to Nilfgaard, spawn others.
   1023423|00000000||Next raid you'll kill all the prisoners. With your bare hands. Or I'll kill your son.
    488699|00000000||Solid craftsmanship. Fitter must've been from the Continent.
   1022167|00000000||Lookie here. These planks aren't rotted yet, they'll do just fine.
   1022169|00000000||Hmm, I dunno. All those barnacles… and they smell o' fish.
   1022171|00000000||What of it? We've a barn to build, not a palace!
    519368|00000000||All right. Let him stay there.
    519378|00000000||All right, guess he should stay in the cage, then.
    519380|00000000||Whaa?! I'll not forget this, an Craite! You want all the glory to yerself?!
    519394|00000000||Lemme out right now!
    519370|00000000||Let's free him. Giant's pretty big, looks pretty mean. We could use an extra blade.
    519372|00000000||Even one swung by a madman?
    519373|00000000||I heard that, an Craite! Let me out right now!
    519376|00000000||Wait here, I'll look for the key.
    519367|00000000||Let's free him.
    513582|00000000||Hey, quick! Let me out 'fore he wakes!
    513583|00000000||Key should be around here somewhere…
    513584|00000000||Wait. Know what they call Vigi? The Loon. For good reason, too.
    519341|00000000||Best he stay in there till we finish with the giant.
    519343|00000000||What? You out of your bloody mind, an Craite?
    513591|00000000||I thought he was your comrade?
    519339|00000000||He is, which is how I know what he's like to do.
   1074902|00000000||Careful, now… One odd step and you could wake him.
    589914|00000000||What was Birna's motive?
    589916|00000000||What was her motive?
    589918|00000000||It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
    589920|00000000||If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
    589898|00000000||Why'd you betray them? Talk. Or I'll finish what I started.
   1070530|00000000||It's Birna Bran, isn't it?
   1070533|00000000||You were never a good liar, Arnvald.
    589913|00000000||We need proof.
    567537|00000000||We need proof. Your word against Birna's - that's not enough.
   1070527|00000000||Arnvald, help us, and I'll ask my da to grant you an honorable death. I'll insist.
    569565|00000000||I've letters from her… instructions, how to poison the mead. But she never signed them, there's no seal.
    585749|00000000||Will that be enough?
    585751|00000000||It'll have to be… We shouldn't delay. Time to gather the jarls.
   1075596|00000000||If you've a yen to fight on, Valgard's ready.
   1047177|00000000||You've more fights ahead of ye. First you must defeat Grim from Helmstein on Ard Skellig, and Valgard from near Kaer Trolde.
   1075598|00000000||Grim'll be glad to mix it up. If you've any fight left in ye, that is.
    521754|00000000||Time for your next challenge. If you don't fear fighting a champion, Olaf awaits you on An Skellig.
    521752|00000000||Beautiful fight. Congratulations on your victory.
    521753|00000000||Beautiful fight. Einar retains his title, but waits to be challenged anew.
   1071131|00000000||Well… I'd prefer to see Cerys enthroned… but it seems it was not to be.
   1071129|00000000||This is good. No one in these isles deserves the throne more than does Cerys.
   1086459|2a760071||Drummond Shieldmaiden
    496981|00000000||So, it's a complex curse… Meaning I need more information.
    496985|00000000||I understand… But I've told you all I know.
    496987|00000000||Speak with Toradar's son, Einar. He was in the garden when Morkvarg and his men attacked. He saw what happened. Of all the pilgrims there at the time, he alone escaped with his life.
    506318|00000000||He settled in Larvik. You'll find him there at the landing, provided he's not out to sea when you arrive.
    478698|00000000||And yet bother us he does.
    478699|00000000||Impossible. I split him open from head to…
    478700|00000000||You were not the first. Several brave lads have cleaved the beast… But Morkvarg always returns.
    496965|00000000||I can get rid of Morkvarg. Don't know what he's turned into, but a silver sword should do the trick.
    496967|00000000||It's not that simple. There have been those who have bested Morkvarg… Yet he always returns.
    496938|00000000||I can rid you of Morkvarg.
    496975|00000000||I'm not here to work.
    496977|00000000||I doubt Morkvarg cares. Monsters prowl when they will and where they will.
    496979|00000000||Fine. He comes within reach of my sword, I'll deal with him… But only then.
    496939|00000000||I'm not here to work.
    479957|00000000||Morkvarg? What's that?
    480021|00000000||Who, you mean…
    480023|00000000||The vilest man ever to inhabit Skellige. Nothing was ever sacred to him. He attacked his own clan's lands, took gold from Nilfgaard, killed children, pregnant women…
    485088|00000000||Mhm. Know the type.
    480079|00000000||They said he feared only one thing - the wrath of the gods. Morkvarg sought to prove how wrong they were. So he sailed to Hindarsfjall to ransack the goddess' garden. This was over a decade ago.
    480081|00000000||Arch priestess Ulve stood in his way. He thrust a blade between her ribs and cast her down in the mud. As her lifeblood left her, she cursed him… And Morkvarg transformed into a beast.
    485090|00000000||A curse, a monster… You've got some work to do…
    478633|00000000||Morkvarg? What's that?
    478641|00000000||Where is this holy garden?
    478642|00000000||Not far from here… North. We cultivated healing herbs there once…
    478644|00000000||And now?
    479620|00000000||Now we walk only as far as the tree the goddess planted. We place our offerings and make our pleas before it.
    479676|00000000||Those who venture below… remain in the garden, forever.
    478632|00000000||Where is the holy garden?
    479598|00000000||A coward who willingly seeks battle… Am I the only one who sees the contradiction?
    479601|00000000||That's why he did it. Craven knew he would prove the elders wrong only if he killed Morkvarg.
    499447|00000000||And thus regain his honor - and his name.
    479615|00000000||Trial by ordeal. Very Skelligan.
    479617|00000000||I do not mock your laws - please also respect ours.
    479592|00000000||Cowards don't usually fight monsters…
    478638|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    478766|00000000||I understand you intend to enter the garden?
    478767|00000000||I dislike it when foreigners enter the sacred grounds… But so be it.
    478639|00000000||Custom demands pilgrims make an offering of their own blood before the tree. Craven surely did so… Unless he lacked not only courage but respect for Freya as well.
    479674|00000000||You needn't worry about us. Geralt and I always give the gods the respect they are due.
    478634|00000000||Thanks for your help.
    479621|00000000||Already killed the monster in the garden.
    478694|00000000||This Morkvarg… half-man, half-wolf?
    479829|00000000||Yes…
    479831|00000000||Won't bother you anymore. Already killed it.
    478701|00000000||I know… Craven went there before you but has yet to return.
    478702|00000000||Didn't see him in the garden… Doesn't bode well. Don't know if there's much point in going there.
    479861|00000000||Even if he's dead… we could find some clues near his body.
    479864|00000000||Let's hope.
    479400|00000000||This Craven you mention… Does he have a name?
    491917|00000000||He did… Until the elders struck him from the Saga of Ancestors.
    479409|00000000||It's as if he has ceased to exist. The law forbids anyone from touching him, speaking to him… Even uttering his name.
    499424|00000000||What did he do to deserve that?
    499426|00000000||He fled from the Wild Hunt… He alone!
    479587|00000000||We need to talk to him… Even if it's not in keeping with your customs.
    479588|00000000||You've come too late. He went to the garden, to fight Morkvarg.
    479384|00000000||Craven? Who're we talking about?
    479385|00000000||What was Ciri doing here?
    479387|00000000||Remember anything else? Anything at all?
    499431|00000000||Only that she seemed tired. Very tired. And… and her hair was wet.
    499433|00000000||Great, so we know she bathed. Progress.
    479394|00000000||I'm sorry. Skja--
    479459|00000000||Craven.
    479461|00000000||My apologies. Craven. Craven could've told you more.
    479220|00000000||We're looking for a young woman, name of Ciri. Ashen hair, green eyes...
    479222|00000000||I'm sorry. She is not here.
    479225|00000000||Unless she lies in a grave… That is, I do not recall one by that name, but I've buried so many… I may have forgotten.
    479227|00000000||This… This Ciri… Has she a scar? Here, on her cheek?
    479234|00000000||Yes, yes. What happened to her?
    479235|00000000||Don't know. Saw her but for a moment, right before… before it all. She was in the stables with… Craven.
    479371|00000000||A thousand curses upon him.
    479209|00000000||We're looking for an ashen-haired young woman.
    479210|00000000||They say the Wild Hunt destroyed your village…
    479218|00000000||They say the Wild Hunt destroyed this village…
    479281|00000000||That is true… Though few believe us. You don't either, I'm sure.
    479313|00000000||Did you see riders on skeletal horses? Wearing frost-covered armor?
    479315|00000000||Aye… That's how it was… They landed on our shores in a ship made of the claws of dead men… Like in the ballads.
    479317|00000000||Leif yelled to grab the children… Then they came… Cut him 'cross his face. He tried to whisper… Only blood came out…
    479328|00000000||You were to ask about someone, not prod their wounds. That's enough.
    479339|00000000||What happened then?
    479345|00000000||Yen… Leave her alone.
    479347|00000000||You don't understand. If we can learn where--
    479349|00000000||I understand. And I'm still asking you to stop.
    479351|00000000||You're right.
    479343|00000000||Yennefer… Enough.
    479342|00000000||Go on.
    479373|00000000||Go on.
    479375|00000000||I ran out… To get help, to get Leif… But… So many bodies. Jole, Ingvar… Little Nekki…
    479377|00000000||Which way did the riders go?
    479379|00000000||Towards the sea… Through the ravine… on horses made of bones… bones and ice… and…
    479381|00000000||Enough.
    479383|00000000||Get to the point. Now.
    479198|00000000||Ritual of some kind… We'll have to wait.
    479200|00000000||We'll do no such thing.
    479202|00000000||Dear sisters… Pardon the interruption, but we've an important matter to discuss.
    479204|00000000||Can you not see we're commemorating the dead? So…
    479206|00000000||And we're looking for someone who's still alive. Please… This is urgent.
    479208|00000000||Ugh. Then speak.
   1064361|00000000||Udalryk…
   1064363|00000000||Begone, lass.
   1064365|00000000||I'd never let your babe be hurt. You know that.
   1064744|00000000||Yet you almost killed 'im!
   1064367|00000000||It was a trick. We wanted to cheat the creature that haunts you.
   1064746|00000000||Not a hair on the tyke's head would've been harmed.
   1065860|00000000||There's a door the other side. I'd 'ave pulled the little one from the oven right away, no flames would've touched 'im.
   1065862|00000000||The hym would've thought Geralt killed the child. He'd 'ave abandoned you for the witcher.
   1065864|00000000||But when he saw your son safe and sound, he'd 'ave had to go.
   1064748|00000000||Argh…
   1064755|00000000||What you did… It's hard to believe any good could've come of it.
   1064757|00000000||On the other hand, I've known you since you were a child… You're Crach's daughter.
   1064759|00000000||I know you've never harmed another mindfully…
   1064770|00000000||Argh, let's leave it be, leave it be.
    591603|00000000||Found a wreck. It's been here a while. Wood's rotted.
    591604|00000000||Look around, but be careful. Look for something that might indicate it's the mage's ship.
    591660|00000000||Got something. A Skelliger's buckler. Clan Heymaey symbols.
   1008038|00000000||Donar's clan.
   1008040|00000000||Donar was a babe in swaddling clothes when this buckler landed here.
    591665|00000000||Longship belonged to Clan Dimun.
    591734|00000000||Men from Faroe attacked this ship.
    591737|00000000||A man's skeleton… Somebody pinned his skull to the deck with an axe.
   1006818|00000000||A death worthy of a Skelliger.
   1006820|00000000||Clan emblem indicates a Dimun man. So he was from Faroe.
    591736|00000000||Arrows stuck in the side. The kind Faroe folk use.
    592036|00000000||Got a chest, really old. Must've fell off the wrecked longship.
   1006876|00000000||Can you open it?
   1006878|00000000||Hoping for pirate treasure?
   1008054|00000000||I hope to find the djinn. Try to open it.
    592037|00000000||Now that's what I call war booty…
   1008060|00000000||Have you found the djinn?
   1008063|00000000||No. But I found something that could be just as valuable to me, as the djinn is to you.
   1006954|00000000||Beautiful craftsmanship…
   1008043|00000000||What do you have?
   1008045|00000000||A war horn. Bearing Clan Heymaey symbols.
   1017792|00000000||Yen, doubt any of these boats were the mage's. These are old sunken longships.
   1017794|00000000||Come back, then. We must search elsewhere.
    158023|00000000||Getting colder… Gotta be close…
    170624|00000000||Gotta find a way to cross the lake.
    170825|00000000||Rust-eaten, all of it…
    170823|00000000||Rusty shackles. No good to me.
    515466|00000000||Just like Crach…
    515467|00000000||So I heard.
    515468|00000000||Haven't gotten him yet.
   1071455|00000000||Hm, it's deep enough. Shouldn't hit bottom.
    165352|00000000||They say the Nilfgaardian fleet's en route. Matter of days.
    165312|00000000||Let 'em come. We'll greet 'em, we will. With fire and iron.
    165368|00000000||We're barely at the start of Birke yet spring's in full bloom.
    165398|00000000||Soothsayers're claimin' we've a good raidin' season ahead.
    165400|00000000||Nothin' like some overseas plunderin' in springtime.
    165376|00000000||Go serve the jarl, they said. You'll go on raids, they said. You'll have captive wenches, gold aplenty, whatever ye want!
    165378|00000000||Instead o' that, we stand 'ere like wizened stumps… Freezin' in the wind.
   1050001|00000000||We'll go to the tavern later, warm up by the fire, drink some mead. That oughta lift your spirits.
   1071060|00000000||Merciful Freya, mother of ours!
   1071366|00000000||Hurraaaaarrgh!
   1071364|00000000||Into the fire!
   1071229|00000000||For the glory o' the Isles!
    465467|05df8c2c||Golem
    587511|00000000||Vildkaarls don't have families.
    587911|00000000||Spiked gloves… black with dried blood.
    587913|00000000||Ochre, coal dust, woad. Tattoo dyes.
   1070891|00000000||I'll bloody give 'em tattoos…
    587915|00000000||Human scalps… Unusual as decorations go.
    587917|00000000||Dried mushrooms. Psilocybe, I think.
   1070893|00000000||Geralt, finish up your ferretin' already.
    587515|00000000||Won't be anyone to mourn them.
    587513|00000000||Told you - only men live in Fornhala.
    584185|00000000||No women's clothing, items… No toys.
    391239|00000000||Remember summer, three years back?
    391241|00000000||A great many lads perished in the woods that year.
    395512|00000000||And then came a harsh winter and the Spirit showed our hunters where to find game.
    391243|00000000||Spirit showed 'em nothin'. They found the game themselves.
    391245|00000000||Well, I heard the Spirit showed 'em. Put an end to the famine.
    391249|00000000||Maybe the Spirit's killin' now 'cause hard times are ahead?
    391251|00000000||We should send a man to the jarl.
    391253|00000000||Hmph, Crach. Just what we need.
    391255|00000000||The woman speaks sense. The jarl will help.
    391257|00000000||Say what you will about him, but the Spirit would talk to Crach.
    391259|00000000||Argh, shut your gobs before someone hears you.
    436894|00000000||Greetings.
    422775|00000000||Hmm… Don't know you. Come closer, let me get a good look. Sight's not what it once was… Now coins're all I see well.
    422777|00000000||All right, just don't be frightened, gramps. I'm a witcher.
    422779|00000000||Haha. I'm not the superstitious sort, takes more than a pair o' yellow eyes to frighten me.
    436928|00000000||Witcher, eh? There were some of youse on Faroe, long ago. Me father told me about it. Ah, but you come here to buy somethin', not listen to me tales.
    422791|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your wares, gramps.
    422759|00000000||Like to take a look at your goods.
   1086484|00000000||I've come to play cards.
    422795|00000000||These witchers who came to Faroe - tell me more about them?
    422797|00000000||Aye, aye… The isle was riddled with monsters - snarks, toves, mome raths… It's for the beasts the witchers came…
    437332|00000000||Never heard of those monsters. Are those local names?
    437334|00000000||You’ve not heard of 'em, 'cause they are no more. The witchers did well by the isle, and left Faroe a pretty penny richer.
    422781|00000000||Tell me about the witchers.
    422793|00000000||Take care, now.
    422763|00000000||Farewell.
    422761|00000000||Tell me about Faroe.
    422787|00000000||I'd love to hear some tales. Word is people from Faroe are…
    422789|00000000||…scoundrels and villains?! Who fed you this slander? Them cowards from Spikeroog?
    437051|00000000||Actually, that's not what I've heard at all… Hm, guess there's no love lost between clans Dimun and Brokvar?
    437182|00000000||None in the isles likes us much. Started way back with Lovis of Ard Skellig - a stunnin' fair lass. Hordes of suitors sought to win her hand.
    437216|00000000||Her father declared she'd go to the one who brought him back his ring. And when he went to toss this ring into the sea…
    437210|00000000||…the young jarl an Dimun kicked his legs out from under him, tore the ring off his finger and won the hand of the lovely Lovis.
    437218|00000000||Hehe! Witcher, sure you wouldn't fancy stayin' on here on Faroe? You'd fit right in.
    422785|00000000||Ah, it's you, witcher. Recognized the padding of your paws: quiet as a cat, y'are. Whaddaya need?
   1002142|00000000||Are you Tove? I was told drowners killed your husband.
   1002143|00000000||Then ye were told right. First the sea took me son, now me man… I'm the only one left.
   1002145|00000000||Kvile, our son, he went out fishin' and didn't come back. My man'd walk out to the Kjerag Cliffs every day to watch for his boat. I told him he cannot bring 'im back to life, and that he could die himself. We'd heard about drowners, but he couldn't sit still. Donned his old coat and went.
   1002147|00000000||One night he didn't come home. I fetched me brother, grabbed a torch and we went lookin' for 'im. The muire d'yaeblen, seafiends… they'd clawed 'im so bad I only knew him by his coat.
   1002148|00000000||Small comfort, I know, but the drowner problem'll soon end. I promise you that. Farewell.
   1017174|00000000||Is… Is it safe?
    524142|00000000||You claim Ard Skelligers don't like the people of Undvik. Yet you helped them after the giant attacked.
    524143|00000000||When you save a drownin' man in a storm, d'you ask what clan he's from first?
    524174|00000000||Point taken, I guess, but your people gave them shelter. And now you've come to kill the giant…
    524198|00000000||Course we've come. Winnin' back Undvik's the best way to get those folk off Ard Skellig!
    524071|00000000||Your people helped the Undvikkers after the giant's attack.
    524094|00000000||Let's get going.
    524089|00000000||Let's go.
    524083|00000000||Your clan have good relations with any other clan?
    524091|00000000||Any clan out there Ard Skelligers are friendly with?
    524092|00000000||Well… certainly wouldn't be those Brokvar cowards.
    524120|00000000||They'll say it ain't so, but a hundred years back their jarl walked them off the battlefield just 'cause the enemy showed in greater numbers.
    524122|00000000||And Faroe folk are cheats and thieves, everyone knows it. The Tuirseach of An Skellig - always been too big for their britches…
    524124|00000000||Now, Madman Lugos' clan… They're all right.
    524126|00000000||Funny, thought they were your greatest enemies.
    524130|00000000||They are. But we just can't respect the other clans.
    524060|00000000||Know the isle well?
    524068|00000000||I've never been here before. Guess you could say I've never been fond of Clan Tordarroch.
    524070|00000000||In fact, no one on Ard Skellig's especially fond of them.
   1071064|00000000||Gods bless King Hjalmar!
   1071054|00000000||Gods bless Queen Cerys!
   1071052|00000000||Give us peace and prosperity!
    572867|00000000||Who else will race? Who will ride for the glory of the goddess?
    572980|00000000||A foreigner in the Heroes' Pursuits… Don't know that I like that.
    572981|00000000||Then save your whingin' till you figure it out.
    572983|00000000||The goddess watch over you. Or grant you a beautiful death!
    572986|00000000||Go on, Rikka! Show 'em!
    572990|00000000||Won't let you win, vagrant! Can't!
    572988|00000000||You ride like a woman!
    572992|00000000||Yeeeehaaaaa!
    573005|00000000||Haaaaah! First!
   1049657|00000000||Hey, Ruve… Whaddaya say we go hunt the cave monster?
   1049659|00000000||You're daft! Even grown-ups fear 'im!
   1049661|00000000||Exactly! So what if we took its head, brought it back? Can you imagine?
   1049663|00000000||Dunno, I think it'll be our heads gettin' took…
   1062204|59c422e7||Drunk
   1051726|00000000||So long, witcher. And thanks again.
   1051728|00000000||You've paid your debt. On your way, now.
   1051730|00000000||Still got me sword, Volund? Not tellin', eh…? No bother. Got plenty of time to look, now.
    350510|00000000||Thank ye, White One. You're not one of us, but ye sure fight like an islander. How's it you came to Skellige?
    393492|00000000||Long story. Got something to take care of here.
    393494|00000000||As we all do. Me, for instance, I'm lookin' for me sister.
    456108|00000000||What happened to her?
    456914|00000000||Pirates took her. But I'll get 'em in me grip and squeeze. Regret their mothers ever bore 'em as they shit themselves.
    460068|00000000||Greetings, White One. Glad to see ye farin' well.
    460066|00000000||If your sister's Kurisu, think I might've run into her. On Hindarsfjall, at Freya's temple.
   1037933|00000000||How is she?! Sound, healthy?!
    461249|00000000||She's safe, healthy, at least in body. Priestesses took good care of her.
    460154|00000000||I've gotta go there! I've gotta take her home!
    460156|00000000||Here, take this. And you've me unending gratitude! Thanks, witcher!
    460062|00000000||Ran into Kurisu.
   1043589|00000000||Here's hoping you find your sister. Farewell.
    393939|00000000||Farewell.
    393937|00000000||Following a trail? Got any clues?
    393941|00000000||Know where to go? Got any clues?
    393943|00000000||These two here, afore they pounced on me, said their captain'd set sail for Hindarsfjall. Kurisu were on board his longboat.
   1039531|00000000||Got my word on that. Farewell.
   1043586|00000000||Fine. Willing to help.
   1043583|00000000||I'll be sure to say you're looking for her if I find her. Can't promise anything beyond that.
   1043585|00000000||I'd never ask more. Thank ye. So long.
   1043587|00000000||No promises.
    393945|00000000||Hope you find her.
    393947|00000000||Listen, if… if you come across those pirates or see Kurisu anywhere, tell her to go to Blandare, tell her to go home.
   1048264|00000000||Hey, White One! Help!
   1063260|00000000||Calm, now. Calm yourself.
   1063262|00000000||Easy for you to say! It's not from you the gods demand sacrifice!
   1063654|00000000||It's not to you they come in the night, thirstin' for blood!
   1063268|00000000||The gods seek to fortify you, grant you valor, Jarl.
   1063661|00000000||They want you to face your failings, your frailties.
   1063270|00000000||I don't know that, I don't know nothin' anymore…
   1063272|00000000||Rest, Jarl. Think no more of your dreams… You'll feel better…
   1028748|00000000||A game of gwent - how about it?
   1086495|00000000||Gwent - willing to play me?
   1033637|00000000||See you. And thanks for the service - really warm and kind.
   1033628|00000000||Farewell.
   1033627|00000000||Lemme see what you're offering.
   1033638|00000000||Show me what you've got.
   1033639|00000000||Specialty goods alone. But I don't expect a tramp from the Continent to know 'em from tripe.
   1033636|00000000||Well? What?
   1071368|00000000||Into the fire!
   1071370|00000000||Hurraaaaarrgh!
   1028782|00000000||Hard to argue with that. Want a bit more to spend, though, so how about a game of gwent?
   1028781|00000000||How about a game of cards?
    421252|00000000||So long.
    421246|00000000||Farewell.
    421244|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    421250|00000000||Lemme have a look.
    421248|00000000||Could very well be your lucky day! Spendin' hard-earned coin - that's an art in itself.
    365767|00000000||What's going on? Someone hit you?
    365769|00000000||Nononono. Quiet, or she'll hear.
    365771|00000000||Who'll hear?
    365773|00000000||My beloved, beautiful as the morn and sweet as linden honey. Her grace, so delightful--
    365775|00000000||Hm, don't seem all that delighted to me. Where's this beloved of yours?
    365777|00000000||There, in the depths, sleeping. But don't wake her, by the gods!
   1086730|00000000||You're sufferin' ends now!
    347682|00000000||Leaving Kaer Trolde?
    347684|00000000||Tomorrow at daybreak.
    583706|00000000||Enjoy yourself, Master Geralt.
    347650|00000000||Leaving Kaer Trolde?
    347648|00000000||Svanrige's not vying for support?
    347664|00000000||Svanrige's not gonna vie for support?
    347666|00000000||Bran's son will not haggle for a crown that is his by right.
    347668|00000000||Far as I know, crown goes to the claimant who gains the most votes.
    347670|00000000||That is the tradition. But not all traditions are good. The Isles' care should be entrusted to a single family.
    414570|00000000||Got a specific family in mind?
    414604|00000000||Take it you have a specific family in mind.
    414606|00000000||Of course. Bran was the best king Skellige's seen in centuries. The throne should pass on to Svanrige, his true born son, and then on to his sons.
    414568|00000000||What's wrong with voting for the king?
    414598|00000000||What's wrong with voting for your king?
    414600|00000000||Take a walk, listen, and you'll understand. The claimants already hand out land, promise privileges, titles, favorable judgments… They behave like whores lifting their skirts for every passer-by.
    414602|00000000||A king by the grace of votes is no ruler, but a debtor. This must end. We must start by placing Bran's first-born son on the throne. I hope the jarls will see the wisdom of it.
    347644|00000000||Greetings, Birna. Feast not to your liking?
    347646|00000000||This is no feast. It's a farmers' market where votes are bought and sold like sheepskins.
    460050|00000000||Stay with us one more week, Kurisu.
    461255|00000000||I know you feel better, but you're yet too week to embark on a journey.
    460052|00000000||Thank ye, but I don't want to overstay me welcome.
    461283|00000000||Sides, it's time I went home. They must all think me dead there.
    460054|00000000||Fret not, I'm certain they await you.
   1071357|00000000||Into the fire!
   1071355|00000000||Hurraaaaarrgh!
    588137|00000000||Talk later. My ears're still ringin' from the fight.
   1074105|00000000||What're ye lookin' at, huh?! Never seen a pair of teets before?! Sod off, ye pervert!
   1055113|00000000||Not that-a-way! Come back!
   1024280|00000000||If ye hear somethin' in the woods like the gruntin' of a deer, only louder… You're to run back to the village at once.
   1024282|00000000||Why's that, grandda?
   1024284|00000000||Cause a monster prowls there. The kind that would swallow kids like you whole.
   1024286|00000000||Let 'im! I'd cut his belly open from the inside, like this! And then smack 'im in the head - like this!
   1024910|00000000||And what's this mixture for?
   1024912|00000000||It promotes hair growth.
   1024914|00000000||What's in it?
   1024916|00000000||Sweet balm, nettle and burdock.
   1024918|00000000||Me gran always adds mallow.
   1024920|00000000||Then go to your gran and stop bothering me.
    445844|00000000||Geralt, please move before I'm forced to place it down on your head.
    585415|00000000||I do wonder what a monster slayer fears… But we've talked enough, lads. Swords in hand. Let's go!
    585402|00000000||Before we head off, will you tell me about this cave? You could at least tell me what we might have to fight.
    594371|00000000||Only you can know that.
    594373|00000000||Elders say in the Cave of Dreams you face your greatest fears. Face what makes you wake up at night, screamin'. Somethin' that's already been, will be… or just might be.
    585393|00000000||What do you expect to find in the Cave?
    585391|00000000||Uve seems quiet to me…
    585394|00000000||Why's Uve so quiet?
    585396|00000000||Cause he got no tongue.
    585397|00000000||What happened? He lick a frozen blade?
    585398|00000000||No. He tore it out 'cause he cursed King Bran while drunk. Lost his power to speak… but kept his honor.
    594368|00000000||Interesting customs you got here.
    585384|00000000||Geralt, these are the best warriors in me crew. They'll come with us. You know Jorulf, called the Wolverine…
    585385|00000000||G'day.
    585389|00000000||… and this here's Uve Jabberjaw.
    582948|00000000||Tis a good turn.
    582950|00000000||The clans will unite. There'll be peace.
    582951|00000000||We couldn't have wished for a better ruler in these troubled times.
    582954|00000000||Tis an ill turn.
    582956|00000000||We'll have war again before we know it.
    582958|00000000||The weak and poor will suffer once more.
    175619|ea15b01b||Innkeep
    581899|00000000||Only found half. Can you do anything with this?
    581900|00000000||I can use it to locate the other half. To within a dozen yards.
   1008310|00000000||And once we find that, we should find the djinn.
   1008314|00000000||Exactly. Ready? I'll take us there on the count of three.
   1008317|00000000||Argh, no, not another portal…
    581901|00000000||Stop whining. One, two…
   1022012|00000000||Uncle, what's that?
   1022014|00000000||A cork. Somethin' so's I can see when a fish takes the hook.
   1022016|00000000||And this? What's this, Uncle?
   1022018|00000000||A net. For swipin' fish outta the water.
   1022020|00000000||And those, what're tho--?
   1022022|00000000||Those're worms for kids who ask too many questions!
    413021|00000000||Who's the courage to fight the Vildkaarls? Eh?!
    413023|00000000||Well? What is it? Ye scared?
   1069176|00000000||Freya, our mother, may the sea swallow the traitors. Freya, our lady…
    180322|fd248708||Halgrim
   1070272|00000000||Lucky I got 'ere on time… Me legs, they just ain't what they used to be…
   1070274|00000000||Was a spritely lass back when Bran were crowned..
   1050152|00000000||Witcher, hm, how do I say this…? Well, thank ye.
   1046388|00000000||Holger accused 'im, he said, "You don't care for your weapon, your axe is all rusted. You're not going on this raid!"
   1046390|00000000||Whoa… Lars must've been furious… He answer the jarl?
   1046392|00000000||In a manner of speakin'. He stood up… and swung his axe with such force he split the table in two!
   1046394|00000000||Along with the mutt gnawin' a bone beneath it!
   1072956|00000000||Hm… Shame I can't commune with ghosts… Might've told me what happened to the girl.
   1072958|00000000||Keira's lamp oughta prove really handy here.
   1072954|00000000||Blue and bloated… Didn't seem to bother the sirens, though.
   1073464|00000000||Must've nabbed her body soon after she'd drowned.
   1088432|a690eeff||Trap
   1024061|00000000||C'mon, this way. Out to pasture. Nice fresh grass there, you'll eat your fill.
   1049897|00000000||You'll grow fleecy and fat… And then I'll shear ye, and then roast ye.
   1040223|00000000||Thanks… Farewell.
   1040225|00000000||Thanks… So long.
   1040227|00000000||Think I deserve more. Water hag's significantly more dangerous than drowners.
   1040229|00000000||Not denyin' it, but my coin pouch ain't exactly bottomless.
   1040231|00000000||Neither is the sea. Plenty more filth ready to crawl up from its bottom. Might need my services again, and I won't stick my neck out for those who skimp on the reward.
   1040233|00000000||Extortin' protection coin, eh? Take it, take all I got. And choke on it, you bugger.
   1040222|00000000||I deserve more.
   1003947|00000000||Got a monster problem in the area?
   1003948|00000000||Aye, read my mind? Some seafiends got a lair in the bay. Grab folk off boats from time to time… Ye lookin' for work, maybe?
   1040212|00000000||Did it already. Here for my reward. Happened on a few drowners, true, but a water hag was the real problem. Her head get me anything?
   1040214|00000000||Aye. Same sum I was ready to pay for the seafiends.
   1003954|00000000||Job's done. Here's the proof.
   1040217|00000000||Now why would I want a sea-- What the devil's that?!
   1040219|00000000||Water hag. An old, clever one. She was the danger.
   1040221|00000000||Seen a lot o' ugly critters in me life - morays, lampreys, blobfish… But never nothin' like this! Your reward. Well earned, witcher, well earned!
   1021951|00000000||Somethin' for your daughter? Silver earrings from the Continent, perchance?
   1021952|00000000||If me Rete wants somethin' from the Continent, I'll go on a raid. Show me what you got from the Isles, instead.
    478510|00000000||All the more reason to get it over with before they realize what's happening.
    478743|00000000||Just thinking about the consequences.
    478764|00000000||I'm not poking holes, just thinking about the consequences. How about you? Given them any thought?
    478775|00000000||No.
    478778|00000000||Geralt, I'll say it again… We're short on time. Ciri is short on time.
    478782|00000000||Mhm.
    478784|00000000||Fine, you busy yourself pouting. I'll handle the rest.
    478928|00000000||You died in battle. You've recovered your honor.
    478932|00000000||You died in battle. You've recovered--
    480139|00000000||Geralt, this is not the time to cheer up a corpse.
    480141|00000000||A young woman, ashen hair, green eyes. What happened to her?
    480143|00000000||Ssssshhhhheee… ssshhheeee's wwwwhyyy thhhhhheeeyy currrsssssed meeeeee….
    480145|00000000||I don't care about that! What happened to her? What was she doing here? Speak!
    480748|00000000||Nnnnnoooo…..
    480750|00000000||Speak!
    480752|00000000||Aaaaaacch!
    480754|00000000||Speak!
    480147|00000000||Thhhe ssssseeeeeeaaa… Sssshhhheee fffeeelll…. Alllmmmoost drrrrroooowned…
    478930|00000000||We're looking for Ciri. Ashen hair, green eyes… Have you seen her?
    478927|00000000||We're looking for Ciri.
    478916|00000000||Celain, celain, deffraen!
    478924|00000000||Celain, celain, davedar!
    478926|00000000||Aaaaaaach!
    480134|00000000||Are you Craven of Lofoten?!
    480136|00000000||Nnn… Nnoooo… Iiiii….. Haaaavvvvve… a naaaammmme…. Sssssskjalll! Skjalllll! Iiiiii aaaaammmm Skjaaaallll!
    478750|00000000||We are about to make some enemies…
    478752|00000000||I don't need everyone to like me. I most value the opinions of those I care about. You, for example.
    478760|00000000||So… can we start?
    478762|00000000||Mhm.
    478748|00000000||We're about to make some enemies.
    478744|00000000||Fine. Let's get to work.
    478754|00000000||Let's get to work.
    478756|00000000||Sorry to bother you with my doubts.
    478758|00000000||Please, Geralt…
    497263|00000000||That's just it - your 'please' is never a request, only ever a command. But let's move on.
    478742|00000000||Fine. Let's get to work.
    478508|00000000||Geralt, you're getting on my nerves. I offer you solutions, you try to poke holes in them.
    478491|00000000||Need any ingredients for the spell?
    478493|00000000||Mhm. The blood of a newborn, a virgin's tongue and the eye of a newt.
    478494|00000000||Mind trying again, without the sarcasm?
    478502|00000000||I don't need a thing. I'm a sorceress, not a village herbalist.
    478505|00000000||All I need is energy… a great deal of energy. We're very lucky this place is saturated with magic.
    478506|00000000||It's also considered sacred. Priestesses'll be furious if you use the garden's Power to revive a corpse.
    478458|00000000||Need any ingredients for the spell?
    478459|00000000||Black magic's no joke.
    478481|00000000||Black magic's no joke. Casting those spells never ends well. Never.
    478483|00000000||I don't like it any more than you do, believe me. But the thought that Ciri is in danger? I like that even less.
    478485|00000000||I understand. Still doesn't give us the right to--
    478487|00000000||Geralt, please. This is not the time to debate ethics.
    477823|00000000||Putrefaction's set in… but the vocal cords are intact. We might still get something out of him…
    478443|00000000||Doesn't look like the talkative type.
    478448|00000000||Anyone can be made to talk, even a corpse… One must simply know how.
    496845|00000000||Thought necromancy was strictly forbidden.
    496879|00000000||So is premarital sex. But I'm not about to be bothered by such foolishness.
   1018995|00000000||The White-Haired One goes to his death… Nay, no foreigner can traverse the Path of Warriors.
   1018996|00000000||No foreigner's ever completed the Path of Warriors.
   1018997|00000000||First time for everything.
   1019012|00000000||Some only learn from their mistakes. Thing is, in Skellige, mistakes usually cost you your life.
   1024205|00000000||Mummy, whatcha cookin'?
   1024207|00000000||I wanted to surprise ye, but since you ask… Ram's head soup.
   1024209|00000000||Hurrah! My favorite!
   1024211|00000000||It'll be ready soon. Just don't eat up all the eyes, save some for your da!
    475348|00000000||The very devil we speak of. Never thought we'd meet so soon.
   1001882|00000000||I don't remember sendin' for you.
   1001884|00000000||Wouldn't mind waiting if I had a free year or two. Sadly, I'm in a hurry.
    585277|00000000||They got what they deserved.
    585282|00000000||They got what they deserved.
    585283|00000000||How dare ye?! My lads--
    585284|00000000||Were arrogant little shits who were looking for a fight. Picked on the wrong guy.
    593769|00000000||Save us all some time. What's the verdict?
    593808|00000000||Save us all some time. Verdict was clear before I walked in. I'm a foreigner, so I'm guilty.
    593810|00000000||How 'bout that - not just a fighter, but a fortune teller as well.
    585309|00000000||Lemme pay in installments.
    593794|00000000||Lemme pay in installments. Witchers live long. Daresay I'll pay it off, eventually - end of the next century or so.
    593796|00000000||I've a better idea.
    593802|00000000||Why the theatrics? If you wanted to hire a witcher, should've just said so. Would've been cheaper.
    593798|00000000||Why the theatrics?
    593797|00000000||Nice gesture.
    593800|00000000||Nice gesture. Though I'm guessing it doesn't come free.
    593812|00000000||Tell me, witcher. Have you any honor?
    593814|00000000||I do.
    593816|00000000||I paid Leif on your behalf. That puts you in my debt, a debt of pride. You ought to do as I say. So, listen carefully.
    593818|00000000||My lad, Blueboy Lugos - he's ventured out. But not against the Black Ones nor to loot a convent. Got the notion to go to the Cave of Dreams, south side of the isle - and none return from there.
    593820|00000000||You're clever and good with a sword, two traits that rarely go together. So you're to help him. I need an heir… no matter his mettle.
    593822|00000000||Take your things and do as I say - or lose your dignity and good name for all time.
   1001514|00000000||Well, why do ye stand there and stare? You're free. Take your things and piss off.
   1001515|00000000||Gladly. But tell me… To what do I owe this act of... mercy?
   1001516|00000000||You helped my son in the Cave of Dreams, so I owed you. But… kill anyone else from Arinbjorn, I'll break your neck with me own hands and hang ye over me hearth.
    585317|00000000||I'll pay the blood price meself.
    593783|00000000||What?! That's against every law!
    593785|00000000||I make the laws here.
    593787|00000000||Go home, Leif. 'Cause if ye rile me, I'll tie this bag o' silver 'round your neck and toss ye in the sea.
    593790|00000000||You know I don't have that kinda coin. Unless those boys were a lot lighter than they looked.
    593792|00000000||I'm well aware o' that.
    585308|00000000||Don't have the coin. You know that.
    593804|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, I find ye guilty on two counts of murder. Punishment's death by suffocation.
    593806|00000000||But you can buy your way out. By payin' Kori's and Kraki's weight in silver.
    585293|00000000||Hah! Tongue as sharp as your blades!
    593778|00000000||Sharp? He insults me, Jarl. Insults our whole clan. The codex of ancestors says--
    593780|00000000||Quiet. I've made my decision.
    585279|00000000||Fought to defend myself. And Jorund.
    585280|00000000||None came forth to confirm your words.
    585281|00000000||And none will. Always easier to hang an outsider than to try one of your own, right?
    585276|00000000||It was self-defense.
    593768|00000000||Let's get to it. Leif claims you killed his sons, Kori and Kraki. What do you say to that?
   1001886|00000000||You invited me to your lands, Lugos. Said I'd find work here..
   1001888|00000000||Aye… Killin' monsters, not men.
    475346|00000000||Geralt… Didn't think I'd see you again so soon.
    593638|00000000||But he's a vagrant. A foreigner. He don't deserve a trial, not even death by the sword. He--
    593641|00000000||No, go on. I wanna hear this.
   1001454|00000000||My line dates back to the times of Ubin the Great. This dog ended it. He's gotta die.
   1001455|00000000||I pass judgment here, Leif. Remember that.
   1070257|00000000||I can see 'er! I can see the queen!
   1070259|00000000||I can see 'im! I can see the king!
   1070255|00000000||Hang on, I'll stand on me toes… Might see somethin' then.
   1049997|00000000||Did it hurt that monster when ye killed it? 'Cause I hope it did, hope it hurt a lot.
   1024821|00000000||Did ye hear the lift got stuck yesterday? Kjeld hung there half a day 'fore they got 'im down.
   1024823|00000000||I've always said only a fool would hang himself in midair in a wooden box.
   1024825|00000000||But sailin' the sea in a wooden box, that's wise?
   1024827|00000000||Ye fall off a ship, ye can always swim. Fall off the lift… all that's left is the funeral.
   1069122|00000000||Knock him off the horse!
    567737|00000000||Arnvald! Stop, dammit!
    567738|00000000||Doubt he'll listen.
    567739|00000000||When I get my hands on him…
   1069120|00000000||You'll not get away!
   1069118|00000000||Faster! Faster!
    480190|00000000||Had something that needed taking care of.
    480198|00000000||Had a matter to tend to.
    480200|00000000||A matter that brooked no delay, I presume… What was it? A nekker contract?
    480202|00000000||Something like that. Can we go?
    480204|00000000||Mhm.
    477757|00000000||Razed huts and fresh graves. Hm, this must be it.
    477760|00000000||Gathering of some kind… We've come at a bad time.
    477761|00000000||There's no good time to talk about the Wild Hunt.
   1037506|00000000||Quite a few years since I was last on Hindarsfjall. But if I remember correctly, Lofoten should be this way.
    480192|00000000||You should've dressed warmer.
    480194|00000000||Mhm. Next you'll be pinning mittens to my coat. Can we go?
    480196|00000000||Yeah.
    480189|00000000||You should've worn warmer clothing.
    477754|00000000||Greetings, Yen.
    480185|00000000||Good thing you're here… The frostbite was starting to set in.
   1086461|2e41c937||Tuirseach Shieldmaiden
   1042368|00000000||Torn to bits…
   1042370|00000000||Looks like he suffocated. Horrible way to die.
   1042364|00000000||Golem probably greeted them, too…
   1048821|00000000||Freya watch over ye…
   1048823|00000000||Don't fret. If I don't pass the trial, you'll soon forget about me.
   1048825|00000000||Don't say that!
   1048827|00000000||A man who's not a warrior ain't worth rememberin'.
    457303|00000000||He died in my arms… In my arms.
    587993|00000000||Grab a horn, Geralt! We've to drink!
   1049993|00000000||Yippee! The witcher killed the monster!
    349573|00000000||Ah, so those were the Grossbart brothers… Well, seems you need to find yourself a new bounty.
    349575|00000000||Cut 'em down already? Nice work. Listen, give ye half the bounty now if ye tell me where to find the bodies.
    452263|00000000||Sure.
    349579|00000000||No, haven't met 'em.
    349581|00000000||If you do, tread careful. They're quick to stick a knife in a man's gut - often just by way of greetin'.
    452239|00000000||Doubt they'd try that with a witcher.
    393484|00000000||Ye never know with that lot. Right, well, I head south soon. Haven't looked there yet. Fare ye well. We might meet again someday.
    393463|00000000||I'll bite. What's the famous Djenge Frett need a witcher for?
    393479|00000000||I'm guessin' you're a man of the world. Perhaps you've come across the Grossbart brothers in your travels?
    393481|00000000||You hunting them?
    393465|00000000||Aye, quite the rogues, they are. Three of 'em, and every one's got a pack o' rapes and murders under his belt. Even took to grave robbin' lately!
    452169|00000000||Easy to recognize on account o' the yellow caps they wear. Folk see three yellow tops, they flee to their huts. Which don't help much, o' course, 'cause they're also fond of arson.
    393455|00000000||What do you need me for?
    393459|00000000||Hunting outlaws - just not what I do.
    393461|00000000||Think ye can live on slayin' monsters alone? Downright near-sighted of ye, witcher! Strigas are just about extinct, but scoundrels are out there in droves… and multiplyin'.
    452156|00000000||Funny… heard that once already.
    452158|00000000||Yeah? From who?
    452160|00000000||Don't matter. He's dead now.
    452162|00000000||Ye needn't resort to threats. I can take no for an answer.
    393457|00000000||Not interested.
    349551|00000000||What's this offer? Got a contract for me?
    349553|00000000||Might do… if you're willin' to partner with me.
    452152|00000000||Usually work alone.
    452154|00000000||Could pay to make an exception this time. It's not everyday you get a chance to work with the most renowned bounty hunter north of the Yaruga - Djenge Frett himself.
    587381|00000000||Only found two bodies, though.
    587379|00000000||Just one body, though.
    587383|00000000||Only found three bodies, though.
    418079|00000000||Clothing… From six men.
    586853|00000000||Don't see Crach. He talking to the jarls?
    586865|00000000||No, went to his chambers. To prepare your promised reward, no doubt.
    586877|00000000||If you've a spell, witcher, perhaps you'd fancy some fisticuffs with the Vildkaarls? Loosen up your joints after your journey?
    586879|00000000||Maybe later.
    586814|00000000||Where's Crach?
    586815|00000000||Didn't play that well.
    586817|00000000||Bad way to play it out.
    586819|00000000||Think I don't know that? But you saw her, she's so… so…
    586822|00000000||Stubborn? Fierce? Mule-headed? Refuses to listen to anyone?
    586823|00000000||Exactly!
   1071071|00000000||Ahem…
    586850|00000000||Hahaha! True, Arnvald, me and Cerys - we're near twins in that regard.
    586807|00000000||Cerys! Hey! Ah, dammit!
    586724|00000000||I've as much right to it as you do!
    558952|00000000||And I'd expect you to support me, not pinch my allies! If an an Craite's to wear the crown, it--
    585184|00000000||Should be you? 'Cause you got fur growin' on your chin, that it?
    585186|00000000||Show some of your own, and the jarls just might listen to you!
    585188|00000000||Want your mug smacked? Remember! I was left standin' last time we crossed fists.
    585190|00000000||Yeah? So you'll fight the Vildkaarls with me? Wonder who'll do better… You… or Hjalmar the Giant Slayer!
    585192|00000000||Ugh! Stop your shite boastin'!
   1049698|00000000||Time to gather a raidin' party. A sword that don't taste blood rusts.
   1049700|00000000||And a wife without a husband? You know what becomes of her?
   1049702|00000000||Luve… What's eatin' you? I've sailed out many a time before, brought back dresses, gold. You never opposed it then.
   1049704|00000000||Aye, that was then. Before the wraiths destroyed Lofoten. Volker… Don't leave me here alone.
    595590|00000000||The King… King of the Wild Hunt!
    588164|00000000||Crach made an exception for me?
    588168|00000000||Crach make an exception just for me?
    588170|00000000||All know what you did for Cerys and Hjalmar. Today, you're one of us.
   1071056|00000000||Come. Crach awaits.
    588166|00000000||So maybe I oughta stop by another time.
    588163|00000000||Maybe I'll stop by some other time.
    561532|00000000||Master Geralt! A guard spotted you from the tower. They sent me to open the gate. Hehe.
    561533|00000000||Why was it closed? This that famous Skellige hospitality?
    586667|00000000||Nay, 'tis tradition. After the feast, the jarls'll choose the king, so the doors must remain closed. Only the sons and daughters of Skellige may stay in the castle.
   1050095|00000000||That's how ye earn respect in Skellige, Geralt. That's exactly how!
    481276|00000000||If someone's death were to help you find Ciri, would you start making human sacrifices as well?!
    482152|00000000||Just so happens I'm willing to do anything for some people.
    482164|00000000||Everyone else, everything else be damned, is that it?!
    481280|00000000||We're ready to do anything for Ciri.
    481291|00000000||Calm down, nothing happened.
    482166|00000000||Calm down, nothing happened.
    482154|00000000||Relax. Storm's died down, you've clearly got things under control.
    482156|00000000||For now! But who knows what will be a week or two on!
    482262|00000000||Got a feeling we've found something interesting.
    482295|00000000||Just need to examine one more thing.
    482245|00000000||We need to examine one more trail.
    482244|00000000||We learned something about Ciri.
    482246|00000000||We think a powerful curse was cast here.
    482249|00000000||Hmm… Plausible, considering what happened to the wood.
    482389|00000000||Do you know upon whom?
    482250|00000000||Not yet. But we know Ciri was here. She stepped out of a portal. A mage was with her.
    482256|00000000||Someone chased them, they fought. Ciri was wounded but managed to escape.
    482260|00000000||Where to?
    482261|00000000||Velen, probably - the mage opened a portal for her. Then he fought her attacker.
    482258|00000000||Yes? Is that it?
    481888|00000000||Stop panicking!
    481891|00000000||Here's your Mask.
    481892|00000000||It is worthless. It's an unwieldy ashtray at best.
    482141|00000000||I hope you've learned something useful at least.
    482137|00000000||Very.
    482150|00000000||I'm talking to Geralt. You… You I'll deal with later.
    482243|00000000||So?
    482169|00000000||Sure as hell shouldn't be angry. He agreed to help us.
    482171|00000000||When he learns what's happened here…
    482165|00000000||He agreed to help us.
    481275|00000000||We'll see what Crach has to say about this!
    481271|00000000||Are you pleased with yourselves?!
    481272|00000000||Look at what you've brought down on us!
    476183|00000000||May be something left of the one who got hit by the spell.
    481506|00000000||It's clearing up.
    481508|00000000||Ermion must be getting a handle on the weather.
    481510|00000000||Which means he'll be free to attack us again.
    374473|00000000||Let's see where the attacker landed.
    374427|00000000||Where did the mage flee to?
    374463|00000000||The mage who was with Ciri fled, too. Know where?
    374469|00000000||Hmm... His trace path leads to Velen as well… But the target coordinates of his portal differ from those of Ciri's…
    374471|00000000||The explosion must have disrupted his teleportation…
    375047|00000000||Hm, ran into Keira Metz in Velen. Coincidence maybe, but…
    375049|00000000||She claimed a mage came to her looking for Ciri. Be surprised if it wasn't the same one.
    375061|00000000||Hmm... Whoever he is, he grows more interesting by the minute…
    480988|00000000||It's Ciri's companion and the one who wounded her.
    374423|00000000||How do you know?
    377247|00000000||I don't. Making an educated guess. They both appeared in the previous visions.
    481104|00000000||Ciri's got a powerful ally.
   1063411|00000000||…And then… Then a storm broke. Waves reachin' high as the boom.
   1063413|00000000||Go on.
   1063415|00000000||All of a sudden, the wind raged stronger. Heard a tumult off the starboard side.
   1063756|00000000||Looked to see half the crew swept o'eboard, out o' reach…
   1055582|a650f9fe||Jesse Grossbart
    163403|00000000||This place could use a sweepin'. You even got a broom?
    163405|00000000||Mhm. I use it to swat pests, so ye best watch yourself.
    163407|00000000||I'll be watchin' for ye to sit on it and fly away!
    163818|00000000||Give us an ale, little dove.
    163820|00000000||Tell me, Bjern, do I look like Continental poultry to ye?
    163822|00000000||No…
    163824|00000000||Then drop the dovin'.
    163826|00000000||What now?
    163828|00000000||Your eyes! They're as beautiful as… as…
    163830|00000000||As? Come on, surprise me.
    163832|00000000||Well, as… stars. Argh.
   1037484|00000000||This it?
   1037486|00000000||It is indeed! Now, back away a bit. I must deactivate the barrier.
   1043003|00000000||Got the book.
   1042324|00000000||Right, time to get outta here and send this tower home. Where do I look for Gottfried's treatise? Any ideas?
   1042334|00000000||Mhm. The library might be a logical place to start. The key should be in the laboratory.
   1042336|00000000||Where's that?
   1042338|00000000||As you enter the room opposite, you'll see the laboratory to your left, the library straight ahead. But remember - you're an intruder. The tower is certain to want to stop you, make things difficult, at the least.
   1042342|00000000||We'll see who breaks first.
   1042126|00000000||I'll find Gottfried's treatise.
   1037488|00000000||What was that title again?
   1037490|00000000||"Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire." It's a treatise.
   1042441|00000000||Gotcha. Be right back.
   1043004|00000000||What was the book's title?
   1044197|00000000||…That opened the portal and jettisoned us through to Skellige. This, in turn, naturally generated electromagnetic disturbances--
   1044199|00000000||All very interesting, but I just wanna get outta here.
   1042300|00000000||Then you must find "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire."
   1042296|00000000||That opened the portal and jettisoned us through to Skellige. This, in turn, naturally generated electromagnetic disturbances - hence the storm.
   1042298|00000000||Storm I promised to dispel.
   1042273|00000000||Seen my share of wonders, but a tower that teleports itself - that's something new.
   1042276|00000000||This Defensive Regulatory Magicon - I tried to access it. Must've erred, initiated some evacuation sequence.
   1042133|00000000||Tower move itself here?
   1044207|00000000||Some folk from the village came in here, right?
   1044209|00000000||Their remains lie beside the golem.
   1042349|00000000||They came in a few days past. I was surprised to see their garb, but it just never entered my mind we might be in Skellige.
   1042351|00000000||They were just a few, led by a druid. The tower warned 'em, they failed to heed.
   1042353|00000000||Folk on An Skellig usually laugh in the face of warnings. If the tower'd asked nicely, then offered them a horn of mead - they might've left, then.
   1044205|00000000||The corpses over there… folk from the village nearby, right?
   1042343|00000000||Some Skelligers came in here before I did.
   1022562|00000000||Still looking. Be back soon.
   1043005|00000000||Be back soon.
   1042132|00000000||Who are you?
   1042250|00000000||You clearly know who I am… I don't even know your name.
   1042263|00000000||Sigo Buntz, mage and sorcerer in residence at the court at Pont Vanis. This tower was to be me new home. Bought it at an auction, you see.
   1042265|00000000||A tower? At an auction?
   1042267|00000000||It belonged to Gottfried Stammfeld, a mage of some renown. When he passed on, his heirs auctioned the edifice off.
   1042269|00000000||They were all wary, repulsed. None dared see what Uncle Gottfried kept in his colored jars - if it was their contents that had stripped him of his sense of smell and taken his left eye.
   1042271|00000000||They put the tower on the block along with all it contained. The price was unbeatable, I couldn't resist.
   1042071|00000000||Finally, someone's come to free me! And a famous witcher, at that! Thank the gods!
   1042135|00000000||I'm damned lucky you happened to be in Kovir! Was it King Tancred who sent you, or the Society of Magic?
   1042137|00000000||Neither. And we're not in Kovir. We're in Skellige.
   1044182|00000000||Local folk hired me. See, your tower's brought a massive storm to their island.
   1042177|00000000||We're in… in Skellige? So… we've teleported? Oh, this is much worse than I thought…
   1042193|00000000||Lemme guess - you lost control of the golem. Imprisoned you here, then attacked me.
   1039374|00000000||My, no, that's not it at all. The golems are but one of the tower's defenses. Part of its Defensive Regulatory Magicon.
   1042179|00000000||Golem imprison you?
   1042178|00000000||What is going on here?
   1042181|00000000||Not sure I follow…
   1042213|00000000||Ugh. The tower is outfitted with a… a Defensive Regulatory Magicon.
   1042119|00000000||What?
   1042121|00000000||A defensive system, magic. Ensuring only the tower's owner will use it. When it detects an intruder, it locks down all the rooms, denies access.
   1042466|00000000||And since neither of us is the tower's owner, the golem attacked me and you're stuck behind bars. How do we evade its other charming features?
   1042486|00000000||We must deactivate the Defensive Regulatory Magicon. The tower's prior owner wrote a treatise about removing such defenses - "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire."
   1042443|00000000||There must be a copy in the tower. Find it, please. With it in hand, I can try to circumvent the security measures. Send you home, and take the tower back to Kovir.
   1022439|00000000||Find the tome?
    410403|00000000||Twere giants once in Skellige reigned,
    410405|00000000||Our granddads slew them all,
    410407|00000000||Yet one in Undvik's crags remained,
    410409|00000000||We lived in the Ice Giant's thrall.
    410379|00000000||Till Hjalmar split its massive skull,
    410381|00000000||Rid the isles of this fearsome foe.
    410383|00000000||Till Hjalmar and Geralt, heroes brave,
    410385|00000000||Cut him down in his icy cave!
   1017969|00000000||What harm was my vow to you anyway?!
   1017970|00000000||I had no one to talk to! Am I to go to Gremist each time I wish to chat?
   1017972|00000000||Oh! C'mere, witcher! Egill's got something to say!
   1017973|00000000||Aye! That you're a cruel and malicious old buffer!
   1021122|00000000||So, witcher? Will you help Egill?
   1017950|00000000||Heard you calling.
   1017959|00000000||Aye, 'cause I was. I thank Mother Nature she didn't skimp on my voice, as she did with some others I know…
   1017961|00000000||See, one of us, Egill, went mute all of a sudden. No spell or potion helps him. But it is said strong emotions and experiences can restore speech. So, I thought perhaps you might… I'll pay you, of course! Give you an e-excellent gwent card!
   1021126|00000000||Sorry. Just not one of the services I offer.
   1021124|00000000||Doesn't sound like a job for me.
   1021123|00000000||What am I supposed to do, exactly?
   1021128|00000000||Suppose I could try… But I wouldn't even know where to start. You want me to... scare him?
   1021130|00000000||Aye, good, good! That should do it! Scare, irritate… whatever you wish, provided you do him no harm. You can usually find Egill near the hallowed oak. Poor man, he's probably praying in his heart for a cure.
   1017932|00000000||A witcher? Oi! Step over here!
   1017974|00000000||Hah! Heard him screaming clear over here! Grand work, witcher! Your reward, as promised.
   1021136|00000000||How about that. Beard down to his waist… and a toddler's sense of humor. Good luck to you.
   1021132|00000000||Never expected a druid to have such a sense of humor.
   1021131|00000000||Don't like being played for a fool.
   1021134|00000000||Don't like being played for a fool. Remember that… or next time you'll be the one left speechless.
    433303|00000000||Hurry up with that!
    575302|00000000||Speedy Osvald they call me. 'Cause I'm quick. Clever, eh?
    575304|00000000||Ye rode well… But well's just not good enough in Skellige.
    575307|00000000||Ye out sped Speedy Osvald. Not many can brag o' that.
   1069984|00000000||Gods bless and keep you, Cerys.
   1069986|00000000||Gods bless and keep you, Hjalmar.
    492623|00000000||Been talkin' a while now…
    492624|00000000||Jarl must've dreamt another vision.
    567937|00000000||A guard saw what happened. Those weren't bears. They were--
    567938|00000000||…men who transform into bears.
    588243|00000000||Uh-huh. Berserkers.
    585675|00000000||Berserkers?
    585677|00000000||Berserkers?
    585679|00000000||The skalds' name for warriors who change into animals in the midst of battle.
    588247|00000000||The stuff of fairy tales, legends… But it seems to make sense, right?
   1070353|00000000||Mhm. Almost. We were at a feast, not on a battlefield.
    585674|00000000||Got a good idea what causes the transformation.
    588249|00000000||Think I know what caused them to transform - the mead they drank. Smell this.
    585683|00000000||Mead spiked with blood… and something else. Thinking it could be a mushroom, but I don't recognize the type.
    585685|00000000||Hjort might help us. Few druids know herbs better.
    585687|00000000||Can't hurt to try.
    350833|00000000||What happened to your father?
    451777|00000000||He was cuttin' wood and a bear attacked him!
    451779|00000000||Show me where it happened.
    451781|00000000||Over here, past the trees!
    345457|00000000||Aaaaaaaa! Help me!
    345455|00000000||Aaaaargh!
    470231|0d2919bb||Old Woman
   1025930|00000000||Greetings.
   1035022|00000000||That's everything for now. Thanks for your help… and I promise to avenge them.
   1035018|00000000||Might not be easy for you, but I have to look at their injuries.
   1035020|00000000||Least ye asked me permission, not like the others. If it'll help ye kill the beast… fine, do as ye will.
   1035009|00000000||Wanna examine their wounds.
   1035008|00000000||The bodies - where were they found?
   1035014|00000000||Where were the bodies found?
   1035016|00000000||In the glade past the river. The lads… they liked that place, since they were tikes. They'd go there to catch hares.
   1035000|00000000||Well, well. Another come to gawk at the dragon's victims. Perhaps I should start chargin' for the pleasure?
   1035002|00000000||Perhaps. I wouldn't pay you, though. See enough corpses in my line of work.
   1035005|00000000||I'm a witcher. Here because I took the contract for that dragon of yours.
   1035007|00000000||Forgive me. I didn't know. How… How can I help?
   1040009|00000000||I've told you all. Please… leave me be.
    523562|00000000||Get 'im, Olaf!
    523558|00000000||That's it! Good!
    523563|00000000||Oh, he just fist-ploughed his gob!
    523565|00000000||Olaf! Olaf! Olaf!
    523566|00000000||Finish him!
    523564|00000000||Haaaaaa!
    523567|00000000||The fight is done! Geralt of Rivia wins! Behold our new champion!
    523570|00000000||The fight is done! Olaf retains his title!
    569130|00000000||I really hope Hjalmar's doin' somethin' useful, not just lookin' for a fight.
   1070358|00000000||Relax. Your brother's impetuous, not stupid.
    376343|00000000||Someone chased Ciri. See that? Might've wounded her.
    376345|00000000||She escaped. Through another portal.
    481141|00000000||Know where it led?
    481142|00000000||Magic residue trail leads to… Velen.
    498796|00000000||Any chance you can figure out where Ciri's companion fled to? His portal's gotta be nearby.
   1063746|00000000||I'll try to find it. Come.
    414739|00000000||Beautifully wrought… Where these goblets from?
    414741|00000000||A temple to the Eternal Fire! More silver there than in a dragon's hoard!
    414743|00000000||So on the Continent they raise temples… to fire?
    414745|00000000||Aye, they do. Don't know the real gods.
    437793|00000000||And water - it get its own tabernacle? Or air?
    414747|00000000||Dunno. But if they do, we'll loot them as well!
   1056428|00000000||If my grandson's voted king, we'll all drink from silver! Take the goblet round, tell the others!
    454151|00000000||If my lad's voted king, we'll all drink from silver! Take the goblet round, tell the others!
    462290|00000000||Doors're locked. They'll open for Bran's wake, not before.
   1056506|00000000||Unfittin' to leave a wake early. You oughta knock back a horn with the jarl, in honor o' the deceased.
   1024999|00000000||Innkeep! Beer!
   1025001|00000000||We're back, fresh from a raid and laden with loot! Time to celebrate!
   1025003|00000000||And bring us somethin' to gnaw on! Quick, now!
   1025005|00000000||That hollerin' might pass in Continental inns, but you're back home now, so have some manners!
   1036620|00000000||"How to Live and Die Happily: A Modern Exegesis of Lebioda" - what the hell's this doing here?
   1036619|00000000||"Who's Who Among Koviri Sorcerers."
   1036621|00000000||"Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire." This is it!
   1036618|00000000||"Alchemy for Household Dilemmas, Vol. 3." This isn't it.
   1036617|00000000||"Applied Golemancy" - gotta keep looking.
   1036616|00000000||"Intersections and Geomantic Lines" - not what I'm looking for.
    506298|00000000||They've seated us here.
    506300|00000000||I asked them to. Wanted to meet the notorious witcher Geralt.
   1070465|00000000||We've met. Don't remember?
   1070467|00000000||That was ages ago. Hjalmar and I were children when you last visited our da. But you should meet your feast-mates. Allow me the dubious honor.
    506303|00000000||That's Halbjorn, son of Holger Blackhand. Blueboy Lugos, Madman Lugos' firstborn. And chokin' down a stockfish over there's Otrygg an Hindar.
    516438|00000000||Forgive me, I remember our meeting those years ago, but I don't recall your name.
    516440|00000000||Cerys an Craite. Crach, her da, and her big brother Hjalmar call her Sparrowhawk. A jarl's daughter she is. Fat lot of good it does her.
    516431|00000000||And what's your name? Sorry, forgot.
    516432|00000000||You're jarls' sons, all.
    516434|00000000||Seems they sat us with the sons of jarls, exclusively.
    516436|00000000||Cerys an Craite is the daughter of a jarl, Geralt. Jarls' daughters are in no way inferior to their sons.
   1070596|00000000||Do you know every last one of 'em dreams of bein' Bran's successor? Look at 'em - likely lot.
    499928|00000000||Cerys is jealous, for the one among us who performs the greatest feat will be crowned king.
    508457|00000000||We all know the feats are a sideshow. Our fathers will choose who will wear the crown. What d'you think they spoke to Crach about?
    508459|00000000||You talk like that 'cause you're short of strength and skill. Remember when Hjalmar challenged us all to a race up the mount? You didn't stand with us then. As he buried his axe in that stump at the top to mark his victory, you were warmin' your chicken bones by the fire.
    516441|00000000||Had my reasons for not participatin'. But I woulda won then, as I'd win now.
   1057944|00000000||Hm, now that you mentioned him… just noticed Hjalmar's not here.
   1057946|00000000||My brother walks his own paths.
    508461|00000000||But about the race… why don't we repeat it? I'm willin' to challenge any of you, witcher included. If I beat him to the top, venture to say that'd be a feat, eh? So, you in?
    508463|00000000||If the witcher's in.
    508465|00000000||Geralt?
    500673|00000000||See the wake's in full swing.
    500674|00000000||Lost sight o' youse. Who won?
    500697|00000000||I lost.
    500698|00000000||Lost to a witcher, Sparrowhawk. That'd likely happen to any of us.
    500694|00000000||Cerys, proving she's her brother Hjalmar's equal in every way. She retrieved the axe from the cliff.
    500695|00000000||Cannot be!
    508497|00000000||Now I know why Hjalmar named you Sparrowhawk!
    501400|00000000||Dunno why ye strayed from the agreed path, witcher. But if one were to ask me, I might say ye gave up.
    501401|00000000||Be that as it may, still a good excuse for a drink. Crach's rolled out some prime mead!
    373774|00000000||Not me.
    373786|00000000||Can't today, for good reason, believe me.
    373788|00000000||If not today, then when?!
    503864|00000000||You've been great company. Sadly, it's time we moved on.
   1058733|00000000||Really…?
   1058735|00000000||Indeed. We must talk. But not here.
    516651|00000000||You shall learn all beyond that door.
    420437|00000000||To my beautiful companion!
    420413|00000000||Pass the mead and a tankard for the man!
    420415|00000000||To Bran! May he want for nothing in the world beyond!
    376355|00000000||To Cerys!
    373772|00000000||Let's drink.
    373770|00000000||Enough of the natterin'. Let's drink!
    346948|00000000||Honored to be asked, but maybe some other time.
    346950|00000000||Shame.
    346942|00000000||Another time.
    346940|00000000||Sure. I'll race.
    499936|00000000||Gladly. What're the rules?
    499937|00000000||Whoever pulls Hjalmar's axe from the stump at the top of the hill, wins. Stray off the path, and you lose.
    499938|00000000||And here I was ready to puke from all the boredom! Let's go!
   1042438|00000000||There, at last!
   1042446|00000000||Looked easy.
   1042448|00000000||The hardest part is yet to come. We must reach the heart of the tower and cast a deactivating spell.
   1042545|00000000||The tower will surely do everything in its power to stop us.
   1042539|00000000||Lead the way.
   1027459|00000000||Let's do it.
   1027469|00000000||Gimme a minute. Need to prepare.
   1042445|00000000||Of course. But please do hurry.
   1027460|00000000||Need to prepare.
   1027466|00000000||Ready? Can we go?
   1071221|00000000||Long live Cerys! Long live the queen!
   1071227|00000000||We'll follow you always - into the fire!
   1071225|00000000||Black Ones ready yourselves! We're comin' for yous!
   1071223|00000000||Long live Hjalmar! Skellige's new king!
    578556|00000000||Wouldn't happen to play gwent would you?
    578557|00000000||Certainly! I got my first deck, oh, years ago, back in Cintra. Proceeded to teach the game to half of Skellige. Why do you ask - looking to play?
    578562|00000000||Yeah, glad to play a round.
    578548|00000000||Let's play.
    578563|00000000||Another time, maybe.
    578549|00000000||Not now.
    578560|00000000||Got time to play cards…?
    578561|00000000||I don't… ah, dog's arse, let's play.
    578547|00000000||A round of gwent, maybe?
    578565|00000000||Lovely! My congratulations! You've a good deck, but it could use a bit of supplementation.
   1042470|00000000||Here - take this card.
   1042472|00000000||Thanks.
   1076477|00000000||You've a knack for it, so much so you ought to challenge Crach. I gave him his deck, introduced him to the game, but the pupil has surpassed his master. There's also Gremist. A vile character, but undeniably talented.
    578564|00000000||Chin up. No shame in losing to me.
   1042476|00000000||If you wish to add to your collection, play Sjusta - he shan't refuse. Madman Lugos would also never turn down a match - I'll miss him in that respect.
   1042474|00000000||If you wish to add to your collection, play Sjusta or Madman Lugos. Neither is capable of refusing a round or two.
    475415|934cc8af||Innkeep
    488316|00000000||Well? Know what it is?
    488337|00000000||It's a hym. A post-Conjunction creature, very rare and very dangerous. It latches onto men who commit vile deeds.
    501977|00000000||It feeds on their pain for years, fueling their guilty conscience. In the end, hyms force their victims to mutilate themselves.
    488399|00000000||Sounds unpleasant. Any way to defeat it?
    488404|00000000||Hmm… two methods that work. In theory.
    488462|00000000||They say a hym can be tricked. You have to pretend to do something horrible. Then it'll move on to you as its new victim.
    502153|00000000||When it realizes it's been tricked, it'll be forced to leave.
    502154|00000000||Great! Let's try it!
    502155|00000000||Don't know anyone who's pulled it off.
    502140|00000000||Well maybe no one's thought up a trick that was good enough.
    488417|00000000||You can try to trick it.
    488416|00000000||There's the witchers' way.
    488431|00000000||Witchers' bestiaries say you have to spend a night in the hym's lair. With the affected individual.
    488444|00000000||The haunted house, you mean? It's hardly cozy, but I wager you've slept in worse conditions.
    488446|00000000||It's not about sleeping. You've gotta draw the hym out. It has to emerge from the shadows, show itself.
    501980|00000000||Can't hurt it otherwise.
    502100|00000000||And it's sure to give as good as it gets.
    502131|00000000||You've seen Udalryk. It won't be an easy fight.
    488454|00000000||What's this other way?
    488468|00000000||I know you're doubtful, but we should at least try to find a way to trick the hym.
    488639|00000000||Might not be as simple as it seems. Besides, neither method's perfect.
    493883|00000000||What d'you mean?
    495299|00000000||Hmm… And what about the other method?
    493475|00000000||Udalryk might not survive an entire night in the hym's lair.
    494078|00000000||You think the hym… would it try to kill Udalryk?
    494079|00000000||No. That would mean losing its host.
    502174|00000000||But Udalryk could just… expire. He's weak, and the house will summon painful memories. Whereas to the hym, that'll be an opportunity.
    495297|00000000||The more pain the hym causes Udalryk, the stronger it'll grow.
    502175|00000000||And the more dangerous it will be to you.
    493344|00000000||Udalryk might not survive.
    494072|00000000||It's very hard to trick a hym.
    495302|00000000||The hym's a demon, and demons are notoriously hard to fool. Plus, the trickster can't know it's a trick.
    495305|00000000||What?
    495307|00000000||The hym attacks those who have a guilty conscience, truly believe they committed a foul deed. The hym strengthens their regret and feeds on it.
    495308|00000000||Meaning… if the new host doesn't feel true sorrow, the hym'll sense that.
    495319|00000000||Yes. So for this to work, if either of us has an idea, we can't tell the other one about it.
    505472|00000000||Exactly.
    495326|00000000||Both methods seem risky… But I still think we should try the trick.
    495329|00000000||Don't know that I'm convinced.
    495398|00000000||Just please don't tell me you have to consult Yennefer on such things as well.
    495408|00000000||If we fail to think of anythin', we can always try the witchers' way.
    495488|00000000||What can I say… you've seen through us all.
    495489|00000000||So. Shall we try trickin' it first?
    495491|00000000||Yeah. Let's.
    495465|00000000||Guess you're right.
    495470|00000000||Uh-huh. So to prove you wrong, I gotta do what you say now?
    495472|00000000||As long as my name's not Yennefer, no one would call you hen-pecked for that.
    495481|00000000||And remember, if we can't think of a good trick, we can still do it your way.
    495482|00000000||Fine. Let's try to trick the hym.
    495466|00000000||You're wrong.
    495384|00000000||What is it with you and Yennefer? Mentioned her several times already.
    495387|00000000||Nothin'. I've just noticed that… you're often of one mind.
    495389|00000000||Saying I'm hen-pecked?
    495391|00000000||Not that you're especially different… Seems to happen to all men…
    495432|00000000||Take a rowdy Skelliger, a brave knight or a tough witcher - you all end up wrapped around some woman's finger.
    495381|00000000||What was that about Yennefer?
    495380|00000000||Fine, let's try tricking it.
    495478|00000000||Hmm… Trying the trick can't hurt.
    495449|00000000||Good decision.
    495454|00000000||Haunted house, the hym's lair - only place where anything like this could work.
    496242|00000000||Meet you there. Got something to tend to on the way.
    496786|00000000||Fine. See you.
    496781|00000000||We'll meet there.
    496780|00000000||Let's go now.
    496241|00000000||No reason to delay.
    522054|00000000||I'm ready.
    522055|00000000||Fight mercilessly, but do it with honor!
    522058|00000000||And save some strength for your next bout, haha!
    543064|00000000||I'm ready.
    543066|00000000||That's grand! In that case, fight!
    522046|00000000||I'm ready.
    522049|00000000||I'll try another time.
    522048|00000000||Farewell.
    522047|00000000||Who'm I gonna fight?
    522050|00000000||Who's my opponent?
    522051|00000000||Haha, curiosity's bit ye, eh? His name's Grim - whooo… He's a lumberjack - spends winters brawlin' in taverns. Tried to win the championship this season, but… twaddle, nothin' came of it.
    522044|00000000||Greetings. You know me?
    522045|00000000||Aye, I've heard of you.
    543082|00000000||Folan's been me mate since we were tykes - and you done saved his life!
    543070|00000000||You joined Hjalmar's crew, went and killed the giant of Undvik!
    543080|00000000||You're the one saved Jarl Udalryk!
    543084|00000000||Don't recall exactly why - but I'm sure it was unsavory.
   1059886|00000000||Heard you, uh, hold fights here…
   1059888|00000000||Ye, uh, heard right. Try your luck if ye like.
    543049|00000000||Wanna fight again.
    543051|00000000||Soon as you're ready, just say the word.
   1050052|00000000||From this day on, my home is your home.
    476094|00000000||This is the spot. Put on the Mask.
    476096|00000000||Any instructions?
    480864|00000000||Keep it on until we've seen everything.
    480865|00000000||And don't stray far. Telepathy is limited in range.
   1022713|00000000||Ruar, don't eat so much.
   1022715|00000000||Why the spit not?
   1022717|00000000||Cause if you get hit in the gut and those herrings get tangled in your entrails, there'll be no hope for you.
   1022719|00000000||Folmer's right. Shouldn't eat nor drink too much 'fore a raid. After, though, revel till you drop!
    482575|00000000||You said the Wild Hunt was on Hindarsfjall.
    482566|00000000||Speaking of the Hunt - mentioned it appeared on Hindarsfjall.
    482437|00000000||Well, it happened at least a fortnight after the cataclysm struck here on Ard Skellig.
   1064518|00000000||The wraiths raided Lofoten, at dusk, in a blizzard.
    482438|00000000||Itself a strange occurrence for that time of year.
    482439|00000000||The islanders said the wraiths, they barged into their huts. Killed anyone who resisted, then galloped inland, laughing fiendishly.
    482441|00000000||Anyone survive?
    482442|00000000||A dozen or so women and an old man.
    482530|00000000||Next stop - Hindarsfjall.
    482577|00000000||I'll meet you on the beach near Lofoten.
   1064542|00000000||Good luck to you. Inform me once you've learned anything new.
    498080|00000000||Wait. Can't we go together? Right now?
    498081|00000000||But you detest being teleported.
    503192|00000000||Don't exactly like potions either, but I drink 'em when I have to.
    503196|00000000||Mhm… you also drink them when there's no need at all. Very well, let's go. Stay close to me.
    498078|00000000||Let's go together, right now.
    498082|00000000||Mhm. See you there.
    498079|00000000||See you there.
    436908|00000000||It's a long story that involves the Elder Blood, Ciri's abilities…
    436910|00000000||Did she, perchance, inherit her mother's skills?
    436912|00000000||Ciri can do much more than her mother could. But right now we're much more interested in what the Wild Hunt was doing on Hindarsfjall.
    436906|00000000||Tell you later.
    436904|00000000||Wild Hunt wants her because of the Elder Blood in her veins.
    436916|00000000||Elder Blood flows in Ciri's veins.
    482502|00000000||Hmm… 'Tis true she can trace her lineage clear back to Lara Dorren - which is why the women in her family have always had extraordinary abilities…
    482504|00000000||But could that truly be so important?
    436918|00000000||Ciri's exceptional. She travels between places - here and other worlds. Space is no obstacle for her.
    482449|00000000||Huh?
    482451|00000000||Which is why the Wild Hunt wants to capture her.
    348147|00000000||Armor's clean - no blood, no sword nicks. Ciri's friend must've… What do you call it?
    437060|00000000||Vaporized him.
    348149|00000000||Exquisite, the armor… Though the workmanship's unfamiliar. Can't even tell where it's from.
    348151|00000000||Probably because it belonged to a rider of the Wild Hunt.
    348153|00000000||What?!
    433478|00000000||So it's true… the Wild Hunt… I feared as much.
    482344|00000000||First here, then on Hindarsfjall. What did they want?
    482391|00000000||They're looking for Ciri.
    482447|00000000||But… why?
   1055689|f5e2163f||Black Troll
    491986|00000000||[Undress.]
    491988|00000000||[Wrap yourself in towel.]
    491989|00000000||[Remove towel.]
    491990|00000000||[Go to sauna.]
    491991|00000000||[Dress and leave.]
    491987|00000000||[Leave the changing room.]
    475436|00000000||See them eyes? He's an ulfhedinn… Or a berserker.
    475438|00000000||Nah. A witcher.
    390238|00000000||Come over later. I might be home.
    388440|00000000||You all dressed up for me, Hildie?
    390234|00000000||Maybe for you... maybe for another.
    589729|00000000||When's my trial?
    589730|00000000||When the jarl summons ye. Won't be soon.
    592878|00000000||The longer a man crushes rocks, the less eager he is to give lip durin' trial.
    592880|00000000||This one's waited a year. That one - three.
    589733|00000000||Don't have nearly that much time.
    589735|00000000||Maybe we can make a deal.
    590977|00000000||Listen, maybe we can make a deal. They took my things, but…
    590978|00000000||Y'aren't on the Continent. Can't buy me - not with gold, not with honors.
   1071270|00000000||Heard enough.
   1071272|00000000||All right. I've heard enough.
   1071274|00000000||Get to work, then. Grab a pickaxe, earn your next meal.
   1070138|00000000||I don't have that much time. Looking for someone and--
   1070140|00000000||Couldn't give a sheep's arse. Grab a pickaxe and get workin'.
    589734|00000000||Let me out. Now.
    590981|00000000||But see, Lugos said my trial'd be today. Don't remember?
    590982|00000000||Oh, aye… Right… Come on…
    590991|00000000||Got any idea who you're dealing with?
    590992|00000000||I've heard. You're Geralt of Rivia. A witcher.
    592884|00000000||Known also as the Butcher of Blaviken.
    592886|00000000||Aye, and now you're the Jailrat of Arinbjorn. You don't scare me.
    538424|00000000||Rainin' again.
    540183|00000000||Gossip 'bout young an Craite - think it's true?
    540185|00000000||Ah, that's rubbish.
    540545|00000000||Think they'd dare do it?
    540547|00000000||Yaaaawn…
    538491|00000000||Greeti-- *Sneezes* Greetings!
   1043178|00000000||Ye don't even fear the dark god Svalblod. That I didn't expect…
   1043174|00000000||That's the way to win respect in Skellige…
    538497|00000000||Now there's a warrior. *Whistles*
   1043176|00000000||Heard songs about your deeds already, you know that?
    538502|00000000||Sturdy lad.
    538431|00000000||You spied a dragon?!
    538493|00000000||Hahaha…
    538495|00000000||Aye?
    538500|00000000||Charm the lasses, not an old gran like me.
    538426|00000000||Ah. Sorry.
    538433|00000000||Spare me!
    538435|00000000||…may he meet an honorable death. Or come home with honorable plunder.
    582757|00000000||We're just in time.
    582759|00000000||They've already started.
    391728|00000000||Avenged those boys… There's that, at least.
    480909|00000000||What if we dipped our blades in salt? Or cast leaden balls and threw 'em at 'im?
    480911|00000000||What good would leaden balls be? 'Tis a wraith, not some devil!
    503100|00000000||So what do we do? Go to the druids?
    585642|00000000||Quick, they're after me.
    567903|00000000||No time to lose, then. Kill him.
    567904|00000000||Huh? Are you mad? I'm on your side!
    567920|00000000||Not anymore.
    411515|d13ecc0f||Nightwraith
    495777|00000000||Aaaarrrggghhhh!
    495781|00000000||The hym's gone! I can't see it!
    495782|00000000||I saw… saw it sink into the ground.
    495783|00000000||Into the ground? Must've weakened it enough so it hid deep within its lair, in the guts of the house.
    496019|00000000||Listen carefully: I gotta go downstairs, finish off the hym before it regenerates. Don't move.
   1041782|00000000||Whoo-eey, that's some thunderin'. Think he's still alive?
   1041784|00000000||He's alive, all right - and swimmin'.
   1041786|00000000||Good thing he didn't hit me boat.
   1041788|00000000||Look at that, sun's back.
   1044221|00000000||Bet my best net that's no coincidence.
   1028787|00000000||Let's play cards instead.
    421347|00000000||Farewell.
    421345|00000000||Show me what you have on offer.
    421349|00000000||Come on. Let's do some trading.
    421343|00000000||You lookin' to buy somethin'? You're in for a surprise - we're just as well-stocked as any land-bound shop in Novigrad.
   1071594|00000000||Can't hope to clear that. Even with Aard…
   1071755|00000000||Anyway, looking for Hjalmar. Truly doubt he could've squeezed through there.
    410223|00000000||Farewell.
    410208|00000000||Farewell.
    410206|00000000||My condolences on your husband's death.
    410210|00000000||Deepest condolences on the death of your husband.
    410212|00000000||Bran was not my husband, he was my erovring.
   1017233|00000000||What's the difference?
   1017235|00000000||A husband declares his devotion to a woman. An erovring declares his ownership of her.
    410204|00000000||What is it, witcher?
    563053|00000000||Think I even know where from… See that ledge?
    584171|00000000||Mhm.
    563052|00000000||Fell to his death.
    485112|00000000||Must be the place.
   1022266|00000000||Been a while comin'. Maybe they got lost?
   1022268|00000000||They been haulin' lumber along this road for twenty years, and ye think they got lost?
   1022270|00000000||Then maybe dryads captured 'em? Grandda told me they once roamed these woods.
   1022272|00000000||Oh, I wouldn't mind one o' them dryads takin' me…
   1022274|00000000||You're a fool. You know what they do to men like us?
   1022276|00000000||They gut us, then weave our entrails o'er the trees as a warnin' to others!
    480799|00000000||Yes.
    480817|00000000||You know I don't like it.
    480830|00000000||Let it go. I just want to see what happened.
    480851|00000000||Besides, you know there are things I'd rather not know about you…
    480779|00000000||Let's go.
    480781|00000000||Well, let's go.
    480855|00000000||This way.
    480854|00000000||Already found the first spot.
    480818|00000000||Let's go.
    480813|00000000||You do it whenever you want anyway.
    480815|00000000||No harm in it then, is there?
    480798|00000000||Nope.
    480795|00000000||Gonna read my mind again?
    480797|00000000||You object?
    480778|00000000||Gonna read my mind?
    480632|00000000||What now?
    480664|00000000||The Mask reveals the past, but only in certain places.
    480668|00000000||Places where past events left a strong magical imprint.
    480768|00000000||Take it.
    480770|00000000||Want me to wear it?
    480774|00000000||Yes. I'll cast a spell that will let me see through your eyes.
    480623|00000000||What do we do now?
    480624|00000000||Ermion's furious with you.
    480626|00000000||Ermion says the Mask might cause a natural disaster.
    480645|00000000||Fortunate he's here then. He can jump right in, try to tame it.
    480651|00000000||Realize he won't let this pass?
    480629|00000000||Oh, I'll survive, somehow.
    476045|00000000||What was that?
    480620|00000000||Unicorns.
    480622|00000000||Dammit, Yen, I saw the foglets. I meant how'd they get here?
    480614|00000000||The power of the Mask summoned them.
   1050555|00000000||Oh great and mighty Freya! Help us fulfill the oaths we've sworn!
   1050557|00000000||Give us strength and courage! Swift hands and sharp eyes! Lead us.
   1050559|00000000||Right, lads. Let's get to work! Clear out this mine!
    543969|00000000||What smells so delicious?
    543967|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1028775|00000000||Actually, kinda in the mood for cards. Care for a round of gwent?
   1028776|00000000||I'm always in the mood for gwent.
   1028774|00000000||Let's play cards.
    163350|00000000||Thanks for sparing a moment.
    163348|00000000||So long.
    162849|00000000||I like it here.
    163346|00000000||Gotta say I like the place.
    163355|00000000||I should hope so. Found it a ruin when I came here from Undvik. Gulls shittin' into the tankards through the gaps in the thatch. I bought the hut, rolled up my sleeves and made a proper alehouse out of it.
    163357|00000000||Why'd you call it "The New Port"?
    163359|00000000||Continuity. Owned "The Old Port" on Undvik. A few of my former customers come here evenin's to reminisce about the old times.
    163336|00000000||Greetings, I'm Geralt.
    163338|00000000||The witcher known as the White Wolf, I know. They tell stories about you every day 'round here. Lookin' for an open seat at the table?
    163340|00000000||I'll be fine. Just wanted to talk.
   1024568|00000000||Greetings, welcome.
    408204|00000000||Sorry, not who you think I am.
    408208|00000000||I look like a Nilfgaardian to you?
    408210|00000000||What the fuck's your problem?
    545402|00000000||Get in there! Ye wanna crack, do it with the boss.
    408658|00000000||Look, I have no idea what you want from me.
    408660|00000000||Then who the fuck are ye? And what the fuck're ye doin' here?
    408662|00000000||Picking flowers.
    408668|00000000||Wise arse, eh? Well ye can sniff them flowers o' yours - from below!
    408656|00000000||This is a mistake.
    408654|00000000||Take me to the boss.
    408206|00000000||Fine, I'm going.
    408202|00000000||All right.
    408196|00000000||Ah, there y'are. Don't know about your ways, but here, when ye agree to do business, we don't keep folk waitin'.
    408198|00000000||What business?
    408200|00000000||Oh, drop the secret shite, we've not the time. Nilfgaardian bloke, Ville, said he'd send a body for the goods the day. So in ye go, and just be sure to behave.
    511018|00000000||Bad ones. Your son's dead, killed by a fiend. All I could do was avenge him.
    511020|00000000||I told 'im. "Sonny! Nothin' good ever came outta Faroe. Stay home. Your time'll yet come for adventures and glory…"
    511022|00000000||Your reward. This gold brought me no luck… May it serve you better.
    392464|00000000||Bad ones. Your son's dead.
    392470|00000000||We'll talk later.
    392466|00000000||We'll talk later.
    391753|00000000||Greetings. Any tidings?
    587211|00000000||Blood… mixed with bile.
    587212|00000000||Look. Someone walked through it.
    560067|00000000||Don't matter. Body's still warm, they're close. Come on.
    563248|00000000||Wounds covering the body… But he didn't bleed to death. Someone broke his neck. Finished him.
    560066|00000000||What the hell's going on here?
   1064696|00000000||What Cerys did - don't hold it against her. She wanted to help, banish the voices that haunt you.
   1064698|00000000||Help? Casting my babe in an oven?!
   1064700|00000000||Things'll calm down, you'll talk, figure it out. She had the best intentions. Important you know that.
   1064702|00000000||Yet she did not win your trust.
   1064704|00000000||Cause I decided to solve this the witchers' way.
    488770|00000000||Easy, it'll be all right.
    488776|00000000||There's no sense in going if you don't stay calm.
    488778|00000000||Jarl, the witcher is right. He specializes in such matters, he's your only chance.
   1064509|00000000||Good idea. Meantime, I'll place the torches.
    488786|00000000||Wait here a moment. I'll fetch some torches.
    493483|00000000||Will that suit you?
    493485|00000000||Should do. Thanks.
    496126|00000000||Witcher, there's an old shed beside the house. It was used for storing tools and such.
    496818|00000000||You might find torches there.
    496820|00000000||Thanks.
    488781|00000000||We need to prepare the house first. Light some torches in the main room - make sure they illuminate every nook and cranny.
    493477|00000000||And then?
    493479|00000000||Then you just need to show up. I'll take care of the rest.
    488784|00000000||Fear not, Jarl, we'll tend to everything. You should rest in the interim.
    488772|00000000||Get yourself together. If we're to stand a chance, you need to be strong. You need to be a Skelliger.
    488773|00000000||I am a Skelliger.
    488769|00000000||Don't panic.
    488749|00000000||I know what haunts you, whispers in your ear, commands you to hurt yourself.
    488750|00000000||It's neither the gods nor your brother.
    488752|00000000||But I hear it, clear as a bell. The voice speaks.
    488754|00000000||The voice is that of a hym. The creature feeds on the guilt you feel for not helping Aki.
    488755|00000000||Good news is we can defeat it.
    488759|00000000||And the bad?
    488760|00000000||We gotta survive a night in it's lair - your old house.
   1066275|00000000||No. No, no! That'll end badly. It can't end well, I can feel it.
    488765|00000000||No, no, no, no…
   1065415|00000000||It'll never end…
   1005884|00000000||Figured out who brought the berserkers to Kaer Trolde?
   1006049|00000000||Nay. If I'm to be honest, I was kinda countin' on Cerys findin' some lead… but she's had no luck.
   1006050|00000000||But we tracked them down, took care of 'em - and that's most important. Any foes o' Clan an Craite will think twice now afore they pick a fight.
   1005801|00000000||Manage to learn who brought in the berserkers?
   1005956|00000000||So, you becoming ruler of all Skellige - it's changed nothing?
   1005958|00000000||That is no argument to me sis.
   1005907|00000000||So her becoming queen of all Skellige - it's changed nothing?
   1005953|00000000||Tried to give me one or two orders, but I do believe she's done with that now.
   1005887|00000000||You and Cerys getting along?
   1005897|00000000||Argh, as ever - daggers drawn and at loggerheads. Must look somethin' nasty from the side, but all in all, I love my sis.
   1005802|00000000||How're things with Cerys?
   1005905|00000000||You and Ciri - as I remember, you two grew up together, at least for a while…
   1005921|00000000||Aye, spent half her childhood in the Isles. Always at my heels, she was. Scrawny wee thing…
   1005939|00000000||But her leaps on ice skates - why, none of us could rival them. Tried to outdo her once, smashed me mouth on a rock.
   1005943|00000000||And then you went to Crach and announced you'd agreed to wed.
   1005944|00000000||You hear of that? Aye, we had twelve winters on us, both. Any thought of continuin' that romance - me da whipped it out of me head. Hahahah.
   1005971|00000000||Wonder what it'd be like to see her now.
   1005883|00000000||You and Ciri grew up together…
   1005807|00000000||Farewell, an Craite.
   1005803|00000000||Take care.
   1005800|00000000||Planning another voyage?
   1005872|00000000||Got another voyage in mind?
   1006031|00000000||Course. Ice Giant was just the beginnin'. 'Sides, got all kinds of whoresons already sayin' he wasn't that big.
   1006033|00000000||What about the folk of Undvik? You and your men were gonna help them return to their isle and rebuild Urskar.
   1006037|00000000||Cerys'll take care of that.
   1005805|00000000||Ah, Geralt, how're things?
   1050140|00000000||I'll pray for ye! Freya keep ye in her care!
    488808|00000000||So? Ready?
    488810|00000000||A Skelliger's always ready. To defeat his foes or fall in battle tryin'.
    493495|00000000||Only one to fall today'll be the hym.
    493496|00000000||Need I prepare? What will happen?
    488819|00000000||I'll light the torches in the main room. That and your presence'll enrage the hym eventually. It'll show. That'll be my chance to hurt it.
    488821|00000000||And me? What am I to do?
    488817|00000000||Just hold out. It'll whisper to you, tell you to do things. Could be more intense than usual. Definitely won't try to kill you, though.
    488823|00000000||I'll keep it together. I'll try.
    488824|00000000||That's great, but if it's not enough, if the hym starts to get to you, I'll use a Sign that'll calm you down.
    488829|00000000||So be it. Shall we start?
    488812|00000000||I'll explain.
    488811|00000000||Better if you don't know.
    488813|00000000||Ignorance is bliss, trust me.
    489563|00000000||Just make sure you stay vigilant, listen to what I say.
    488816|00000000||Fine. So… What now? Shall we begin?
    485981|00000000||Let's start. Think pleasant thoughts, don't let the hym drag you into guilt.
    488834|00000000||And pray to your gods I'm not wrong.
    485971|00000000||Let's start.
    485982|00000000||Not yet. Gotta check one last time if everything's in place.
    485972|00000000||Not yet.
    488838|00000000||Shall we start?
    170323|00000000||Oh woe is me! Why? Why?
    170321|00000000||Who'll take pity on my beleaguered soul?
    170319|00000000||Gods, what did I do to offend yous?!
    170317|00000000||Who'll help?! Who'll save me?!
    170342|00000000||Look at his satchel! Get 'im, lads!
    393572|00000000||Will Sven visit today?
    393608|00000000||Course he will.
    393610|00000000||I've seen him looking at you.
    393612|00000000||Pull that one in, Hilde. And don't let him get away.
    422358|00000000||What're you peddling?
    422324|00000000||Let me see what you have.
    422360|00000000||Got a diagram. Like you to craft something for me.
    422326|00000000||Need something crafted. Think you can manage?
   1086473|00000000||Care to play cards?
    422362|00000000||So long.
    422328|00000000||Farewell.
    500919|00000000||Tell me a story about one of these weapons.
    500942|00000000||Battle axe looks pretty old.
    500944|00000000||Even older than this keep, and yet still sharp.
    500946|00000000||Once each year, at Saovine, this axe speaks.
    500948|00000000||It tells of blood spilt in battles, of burnin' villages and sunken boats.
    500950|00000000||Might be a curse, and might be it drank too much human blood. What's certain is no one wants it.
    500920|00000000||This sword's hilt is made of meteorite steel.
    500922|00000000||No, it's made from the heart of a falling star.
    500924|00000000||Whoever wields this sword will always find his way at sea, no matter how stormy the skies.
    500926|00000000||But after a time it overwhelms its owner with sadness and longin' for its starry home. And nothin', not even good fun and good company, can cheer him up.
    500928|00000000||Tell me a story about one of your weapons.
    500930|00000000||See this sword? You know by its crafter's mark that it was forged in the isles. Belonged to Lars, who woulda been the same age as I.
    500932|00000000||What happened to him?
    500934|00000000||His wife went missin' durin' a nasty storm. It was said the goddess smiled fondly on her, so Lars refused to believe she was truly dead.
    500936|00000000||He ran out on the rocks and begged Freya to give his wife back. Left his sword behind to show the gods humility. And never returned for it.
    500938|00000000||Selling that same sword now?
    500940|00000000||We coulda tossed it in the sea, but fish got no use for blades. He had no family, so I'm sellin' it… to the right man.
    422356|00000000||Interested in a weapon? There's a tale behind every item I've got.
    480755|00000000||That man in the mask… he's from afar, isn't he?
    484690|00000000||Oh, yes… From very far away.
    484692|00000000||Where, exactly?
    484694|00000000||Aren't you nosy!
    484696|00000000||Surprised? Been sittin' in this fish puddle me whole life… I'd love to travel like you…
    484698|00000000||Like me? No, you wouldn't like that… Trust me.
   1040282|00000000||Eine glav'echen virti adem!
   1040284|00000000||Eine glav'echen virti adem!
   1040286|00000000||Eine glav'echen virti adem!
   1027941|00000000||Quiet, dear, you don't know what you're sayin'. Your brother was a vile man, a criminal. The quicker you forget him, the better.
   1027395|00000000||Agh, shame about Gretter. He was a good man.
   1027654|00000000||Aye, and he didn't drink much.
   1027396|00000000||As for that whoreson, Yorg - chainin' 'im to the rocks… that was too light a punishment. Shoulda lashed his skin off.
   1027406|00000000||Don't say that! Me brother was good!
   1027408|00000000||Begone, man. Let us mourn in peace.
    472745|0ead2ac8||Barmaid
    585568|00000000||Ugh… The stench. Is that vodka?
    413246|00000000||Mahakaman spirit. Someone ruined several barrels of the finest…
    560490|00000000||Good thing da's got other worries on his mind.
    556220|00000000||*Sighs* Ehh.
    556222|00000000||Come on over!
    556226|00000000||Hail, White One! Have a look here.
    556236|00000000||Everythin' fresh as a daisy!
    556224|00000000||Best wares in the Isles! The very best!
    556228|00000000||Careful!
    556230|00000000||Hey…
    556232|00000000||I'm bein' attacked! Help!
    556234|00000000||Fresh goods! Merchant ship sank mere moments ago!
    556238|00000000||All me goods - top quality. Wild Hunt take me if I'm lyin'!
    466979|00000000||Fresh footprints. Could be Cerys'.
    585871|00000000||Oy, Geralt, where you goin'?!
   1070447|00000000||Look! Up there… A corpse, by my reckonin'.
   1070449|00000000||Mhm. Needs examining.
    584154|00000000||No one here. Ran away, knew I'd come for them.
    584156|00000000||Odd. From what you said, they don't sound like the type to lack courage.
    587355|00000000||Let's look around. Could be nearby.
    458978|00000000||Arise! Arise and drink of the blood!
    349116|00000000||Greetings again. See - I had no intention of cheatin' you. Your coin.
    349118|00000000||You're lucky. I'm not exactly known for being forgiving.
    451492|00000000||Still, take my advice - find a new profession.
   1050135|00000000||For you, it must just be another dead beast. But for us - well, ye saved our lives!
    578452|00000000||Gwent - ever play the game?
    578453|00000000||If your question is, would I be interested in playing you, the answer is simple: no.
   1008247|00000000||Afraid of losing? I understand.
   1041521|00000000||Very well, out with your deck. Win, and I'll give you my best card.
    578456|00000000||You're afraid you'll lose.
   1008251|00000000||Fine, your choice.
    578457|00000000||If you don't want to, fine.
   1008243|00000000||Gwent. Play me, Gremist.
    578451|00000000||Let's play gwent.
   1076487|00000000||You won. I believe you're ready to challenge Madman Lugos. I do wonder if he'll agree to play you for his Katakan.
   1076489|00000000||You outplayed me… Were Madman Lugos alive, I'd say you might challenge him for his Katakan with those skills. Incidentally, none knows what happened to the card after he passed on.
    578458|00000000||Feeble. But I expected as much.
    578460|00000000||That was luck, pure luck. Nonetheless, as promised, the jewel of my collection - Assire var Anahid.
   1042382|00000000||Now you must do me a favor. Since you're so lucky, you must fleece Sigi Reuven in Novigrad and Stjepan in Oxenfurt. I found both exceedingly aggravating last time I was on the Continent. Best of luck.
    582930|00000000||I'd rather his sister had donned the crown.
    582919|00000000||I don't like this.
    582921|00000000||A man should sit the throne of Skellige.
   1069980|00000000||Cerys! Cerys!
   1069982|00000000||Hjalmar! Hjalmar!
    569497|00000000||So, didn't get away after all.
    569498|00000000||A small key… to a drawer or a small chest.
    585742|00000000||Time to head back to Kaer Trolde.
    569496|00000000||Rode this way.
   1027392|00000000||Hey! Don't leave me here! I beg ye!
   1027367|00000000||Help! I don't deserve to die like this!
   1027365|00000000||Aaaah! Help!
    578967|00000000||Ilge! Leave them pots, c'mere! We've a brawl!
    578968|00000000||Whoa, whoa! Put your iron away!
   1021402|00000000||We'll not fit on one longship with this many men.
   1021404|00000000||We will if we leave our shields and weapons behind.
   1021406|00000000||What do you propose we fight with, then?
   1021408|00000000||We'll go at the first village with our bare hands… At the second with what we loot from the first.
    348596|00000000||Fine, I'll help you. I visit Novigrad often enough. Might stop by, see how business is going.
    348598|00000000||Thank you! You'll find me in the port district. My name's Johann Bohner.
    451332|00000000||See you later, then.
    349033|00000000||Fine. I'll help you.
    393309|00000000||Don't have time for this.
    393974|00000000||Sorry, in a bit of a hurry.
    393982|00000000||Gods, foul times we live in. A man can perish by the roadside and no one'll even stop to care…
    348600|00000000||Heard a few too many tales like yours to believe yet another.
    348602|00000000||To tell you the truth, I'd probably not believe it either. Alas, I must count on the kindness of others.
    349035|00000000||Sorry, just don't believe your little tale.
    348584|00000000||What is it?
    348586|00000000||My ship was wrecked against a rocky shore during the last storm. I've lost everything…
    393303|00000000||How'm I supposed to help?
    451279|00000000||I haven't even got the coin for the journey home. And with each day's delay I draw closer to bankruptcy!
    348588|00000000||Mhm, might've guessed you'd come around to coin. So, need a loan, or is it just alms you're after?
    348590|00000000||I shall pay you back, every last copper, I swear it! You need only call on me at my address in Novigrad.
    393307|00000000||What is it?
    393305|00000000||Sorry to trouble you, but I really have no choice…
    577812|00000000||Can you trim my hair? Way it is now, it gets in my eyes.
   1067240|00000000||What can I do for ye, traveler?
    587217|00000000||*Sniffs* Wait. Same scent of incense… wafting down from above.
    580684|00000000||What's this?
    580685|00000000||Piece of cloth.
   1070375|00000000||No… It can't be!
   1070377|00000000||What is it?
    580686|00000000||Arnvald's tunic! Only he wears this kind!
    585625|00000000||Sure about that?
    585627|00000000||Saw him in the main hall with the servants. Let's go!
    435911|00000000||Must've felt his clothing rip, but was in a hurry…
    329460|00000000||Hey, listen here, listen well!
   1072821|00000000||And I shall ye tell, how Cerys an Craite tricked a demon most evil!
    352086|00000000||The specter cold and cruel, a hym was called. For years on end, he held in thrall Jarl Udalryk, who could not eat nor sleep.
    352088|00000000||Till one day Cerys, a brave lass of Skellige, called the demon out, challenged him to a duel.
    352110|00000000||She went down to the land of Mörhogg, in whose dark corners demons dwell.
   1072822|00000000||Fearing neither wounds nor death, she called the hym from its lair.
   1072824|00000000||The fiend squirmed and hissed, then sprung at Cerys to grab her, kill her.
   1072828|00000000||But the brave lass was quicker, more clever by half. She stepped aside and with her sword ended his pitiful life.
   1072830|00000000||Listen here, listen well. I was there, I was there, and what I saw I now ye tell.
    497810|00000000||You're right. Let's go.
    497824|00000000||You're right. I hope to come back here one day… We can finish our conversation then.
    497826|00000000||Sounds dangerous…
    497828|00000000||I didn't intend it to…
    484966|00000000||I'm sorry… But I really don't have time right now.
    484976|00000000||I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to chat right now.
    497808|00000000||Right. Besides… it's not important.
    497812|00000000||I'll take Njord, you can ride Grayback. She's old, but she'll make the--
    424649|00000000||Aaaaargh!
    424651|00000000||Run for your lives!
    478885|00000000||You stay here! I'll go and--!
    478886|00000000||I can look after myself.
    497814|00000000||I'm not in that much of a hurry…
    497818|00000000||Your first kiss, wasn't it?
    497820|00000000||O'course it weren't.
    499544|00000000||Argh… Aye. Me first.
    497822|00000000||We don't have much time… But it's enough for you to learn a few things…
    497809|00000000||I'm not in that much of a hurry.
    484968|00000000||No… Except to mention that you fancy me.
    484970|00000000||Wha? But I asked her… Besides, it's not… O' course, y'are very… But…
    484972|00000000||But-- Y'know what? Let's ride. You're in a hurry, and it'll be dark soon.
    484964|00000000||No, just said you like me.
    497802|00000000||Oh… You're here… The horses are ready.
    497804|00000000||As am I. Shall we ride?
    497806|00000000||Listen, I… I hope… My sister, she didn't talk any nonsense to you, did she?
    587264|00000000||Tracks lead uphill…
   1009557|00000000||Let's do it as it must be done. There, 'neath the tree. We'll pray, and then… end it.
   1014391|00000000||Aye, you're right. Be better that way.
   1014308|00000000||Merciful Freya, forgive your sons… Meant to escort our brother's betrothed to her wedding, a storm beset us and bested us…
   1014339|00000000||All is lost… Agda lies dead, her dowry drowned. 'Tis a taint on the clan's honor! Forgive us, oh Freya most noble.
   1009555|00000000||Stop, Mikkel… Freya can't wash our shame away… Only blood can.
    166295|00000000||Bran became king 'cause he killed the dragon Evren.
    172000|00000000||How're we to top that? Eh? How?
    172004|00000000||Heard word of a dragon grazin' 'midst the peaks of An Skellig.
    172006|00000000||Yah, your mother, mebbe.
   1086729|00000000||You'll regret yer mum weren't barren!
    556878|00000000||King Bran himself stocked up with me!
    395310|00000000||Spoils from raids on the Continent, foreigner! Fresh loot!
    556876|00000000||Hey there! Come, take a gander.
    395312|00000000||Come closer, stranger!
    556872|00000000||Greetings!
    395314|00000000||My stall awaits!
    395318|00000000||Help!
    395324|00000000||Skedaddle!
    395322|00000000||Move it! Run!
    556870|00000000||I wonder if they've unloaded the barge yet.
    556874|00000000||Where you goin'?!
    457796|00000000||Human bones… Guess they're all that's left of the lumberjacks.
    365246|00000000||Hmm… sawmill looks abandoned.
   1039761|00000000||What'll it be, witcher? The muire d'yaeblen - will ye help us?
   1002102|00000000||Listen, witcher… Got us some muire d'yaeblen, you know, drowners. Real problem. The kind your silver sword could most certainly solve.
   1039765|00000000||I'll take the job. Dealt with drowners many times… It'll soon be over. Got my word on that.
   1039755|00000000||I'll take the job.
   1039759|00000000||Sorry. Can't take the job right now. Maybe later.
   1039757|00000000||I can't take this on now.
   1039756|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1039763|00000000||Let's talk about my pay, first. A bit too modest for my taste.
   1071090|00000000||That much? For a couple of seafiends? Not a chance in hell!
   1071092|00000000||That's just a bit high, master.
   1071096|00000000||Would ye rob me of me last crown? Won't let ye! We're done blatherin', you'll take the offer!
   1071094|00000000||That's dear, it is… But could be worth it. All right, I'll pay ye what ye want.
   1039726|00000000||Lemme guess… They're tearing your nets, devouring your fish, and attacking the occasional lone boatman or tavern patron who walks home along the shore.
   1039733|00000000||Were that the only harm… Terrors in the bay're meaner than on the Continent. They hunt come dusk or dawn. Attack fishermen wieldin' just oars and warriors alike. Sea tosses 'em up after… armor shredded, guts devoured.
   1039748|00000000||Strange… Any witnesses?
   1039767|00000000||Rurik, my apprentice. He was on a boat the muire d'yaeblen attacked… There's Tove, too - her man was killed. She lives nearby, up a bit. Sorry, none other comes to mind. Those who see the beasts, meet 'em, well, they generally don't come back to dry land alive.
   1039721|00000000||What's the problem? Tell me.
   1039724|00000000||Probably could… But I don't have time now. Sorry.
   1039722|00000000||Don't have time now.
   1002115|00000000||We've naught to talk about till ye kill those seafiends.
   1049948|d360277a||Messenger
    163877|00000000||See the white-haired fellow? Seems dangerous, got wolven eyes or somethin'. Wonder what tide he drifted in on.
    163879|00000000||He's a Zerrikanian. Saw droves of his kind on a voyage south.
    163881|00000000||Zerrikania? That an island?
    163883|00000000||Skidi, see how little ye know of the world? But don't fret, you're safe with me.
    163886|00000000||Ogmund, ye heard the young an Craite sailed off to face the Ice Giant?
    163888|00000000||Aye, I heard. Even asked me to go with him, but I turned him down.
    163890|00000000||Why??
    163892|00000000||Who gives a holler about some giant? It's child's play - just right for a little shit like Hjalmar.
    163894|00000000||Hadn't realized ye knew him so well.
    163896|00000000||The young an Craite? He slapped Ogmund around at the tavern not long ago - that's how well he knows him.
   1055580|332ef499||Manfred Grossbart
    443347|00000000||Wanted to talk to you.
    443349|00000000||What about?
    443351|00000000||What about - what do you think, Holger?! He's not here about salted herring or the currents round Spikeroog!
    443353|00000000||Flap your gob at me again, and I'll shut it for good.
    443356|00000000||Calm down! You act like rabid dogs, not jarls of Skellige. Speak, witcher.
    443378|00000000||How'd all of you manage to survive?
    443380|00000000||What're you sayin'? Eh? That we're the ones schemed this up?
    443382|00000000||Shut your gob. You're cluckin' as foolish as a gander hatchin' eggs! We survived because we're the best warriors in Skellige.
    443384|00000000||You're both damned fools.
    454390|00000000||If not for the witcher… none of us would be alive.
    443221|00000000||How'd you manage to survive?
    443362|00000000||So long.
    443225|00000000||Farewell.
    443219|00000000||Who's behind this massacre - any ideas?
    443366|00000000||Any ideas who might be behind the massacre?
    443368|00000000||Nilfgaard. They've the most to gain! But we'll avenge our sons. We'll burn their shores from Nazair to Etolia!
    443370|00000000||Wonders abound in the Nilfgaardian army. Towers with wheels, Zerrikanian mercenaries on hump-backed horses… But I've not heard of them havin' trained bears.
    443372|00000000||This was Crach, I tell ya! We're in his castle, he let 'em in!
    443374|00000000||Wasted words, Lugos…
    443376|00000000||I don't know who the traitor is, witcher. But I'll tell you it's none of us. We all lost loved ones.
    443358|00000000||Wanted to talk to you.
    443360|00000000||Very well. Speak.
    392738|05dc6a8f||Ghost
    376547|00000000||We know where Ciri might've been.
    376553|00000000||Magic anomaly on Ard Skellig's somehow related to Ciri, or so Yennefer believes.
    436031|00000000||It's my strong suspicion. But I can only know for certain by examining the site.
    436033|00000000||I saw the twisted forms - right unnatural. The druids were barely able to contain it. Explain to me, Yennefer, how Ciri might've caused this great catastrophe.
    436035|00000000||I'm intent on learning that very thing. Which I will do as soon as Ermion stops hindering my investigation.
   1071173|00000000||Do I need to talk to him?
   1071175|00000000||Wondering if I should talk to Ermion…
   1071177|00000000||Leave that to me. Go, seek and find your Cirilla.
   1071179|00000000||If any ill befell her here, on Ard Skellig, on my watch, I'd never forgive myself.
    522443|00000000||I'll help your children.
    522784|00000000||If either Hjalmar or Cerys need help, I'll help them.
    354001|00000000||Head south. The anomaly we should investigate destroyed a stretch of forest along the shore of the bay.
    523203|00000000||A successful feast on all counts, Crach. I will see you later.
    353618|00000000||I'll change into travel attire and find you.
    353993|00000000||I was hoping we could go together.
    353999|00000000||I'll need my instruments. And there's one thing I must yet verify.
    522785|00000000||I thank you.
    522817|00000000||Now that we're done thanking one another, let's get to work. We must determine if Ciri is still on Ard Skellig.
   1072018|00000000||I'll talk to Cerys. Count on it.
   1072016|00000000||I'll help Cerys.
    522447|00000000||Giants... they've been extinct for ages. Anyone actually seen the one on Undvik?
    522449|00000000||Aye. Dozens of refugees have. The giant drove everyone off the isle. I've welcomed what remains of Clan Tordarroch here on Ard Skellig.
    522451|00000000||I heard a rumor - that an unnatural frost gripped Undvik before the giant appeared.
    522455|00000000||Tis true. At any rate, Hjalmar decided to kill the giant and give the isle back to its people. A deed worthy of a king, he believes.
    522457|00000000||My son gathered a hearty crew at the New Port. They were to sail to Undvik, then travel on foot to Urskar, a village. But that many lads should've killed the giant long ago. Thus I though to ask you…
    522459|00000000||You should start at the New Port. Ask around. Hjalmar might've told someone there his plans.
    522444|00000000||Thought all giants died ages ago.
   1073944|00000000||Can't help wondering - got no plans to vie for the crown yourself? Think a good number of the jarls would support you.
   1073946|00000000||A good number? Those opposed would be fierce, rabid. Madman Lugos would sooner see a Nilfgaardian on the throne.
   1073948|00000000||Besides, a man should know when to step aside, hand the tiller to the youth among us.
   1073942|00000000||No desire to be king yourself?
    522445|00000000||Cerys intend to lift Udalryk's curse?
    522460|00000000||Take it Cerys wants to lift the curse.
    522527|00000000||There's no curse to speak of. Cerys has decided she must match Hjalmar and sought out a deed worthy of a queen.
    522762|00000000||Think she might need my help? You did plan to ask me for it. Why?
    522764|00000000||The thing is, I don't trust Udalryk further than I can spit. Cerys won't listen to me or her brother. Yet confronted by a professional who will explain why she's mistaken, she just might come to her senses.
    522766|00000000||So, yes, I ask that you explain things to her and bring her back.
    509131|00000000||I've one more matter to broach - my children.
    522442|00000000||You remember Hjalmar? Well, he swore an oath to kill the giant of Undvik, set off and has yet to return.
   1058307|00000000||Whereas Cerys announced that she's to set off on an adventure of her own. Got it in her head that Udalryk is not mad, but cursed…
   1072002|00000000||I've one more matter to broach - my child, my lass.
   1072004|00000000||You remember Cerys? Well, recently she declared she must set off on an adventure. To bolster her chances of winning Skellige's crown.
   1072006|00000000||Got it in her head that Udalryk is not mad, but cursed…
    436037|00000000||Thank you.
    436039|00000000||No need. I swore an oath once. I aim to keep it.
    509123|00000000||Arnvald!
    509126|00000000||Tell the druid I must speak to him. At the usual spot.
   1071172|00000000||Thank you.
    522033|00000000||Don't concern yourself with him. Druids have little trust for mages, but Ermion's heart is in the right place. Am I right to assume he does not know you seek Ciri?
    522035|00000000||It's of no concern to him.
    522037|00000000||As I thought. At any rate, Ard Skellig's my isle. You've my permission to investigate as you see fit.
   1071165|00000000||Need your help. Ciri probably came here to Skellige…
   1071167|00000000||And very likely caused the cataclysm along the coast. The site upon which the druids focus so intensely now.
   1071169|00000000||A site Ermion refuses to let us explore.
   1071171|00000000||Specifically, he won't let me explore it. We fought, we're not friendly now.
    376551|00000000||Need your help with Ermion.
    436017|00000000||No specific reason. She and Cerys - they're of a similar age. But we'll speak of my children later. First, let's speak of yours. Yennefer claims Ciri's in trouble, and you seek her.
    436019|00000000||That's right.
    376536|00000000||If you require aid - gold, ships, anything - merely say the word. I'll give you all I can.
    435862|00000000||And I know the lass lives. I'm sure of it. When the blood of Riannon's daughters is shed, the sea grows white with fury. I'd mark such a storm.
    376540|00000000||How was it, Geralt, when Ciri was nearing womanhood?
    435866|00000000||I remember well her nan, her mother… what they were like. They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree…
    521459|00000000||Ciri was impossible to control. No telling her what to do. Had to have things her own way, almost always. Why do you ask?
    374168|00000000||Any news of Hjalmar?
    374170|00000000||None, Jarl.
    374172|00000000||Gods dammit.
    485943|00000000||It's over.
    488852|00000000||Over?
   1065894|00000000||I killed the hym. You're free.
    502278|00000000||The hym's gone. So are the voices that tortured you.
    502295|00000000||Don't worry, it'll pass.
    502299|00000000||You're disoriented, but don't worry, it'll pass.
    502328|00000000||What will you do?
    502329|00000000||Farewell.
    502331|00000000||Good idea. Take care of yourself.
   1064951|00000000||Generalize much? I'd say when someone's got a good idea, there's no reason to deny it - and whether they're man, woman or dwarf doesn't come into play.
   1064953|00000000||Is that why you wouldn't trust me with the hym? It was just a bad idea?
   1064955|00000000||No. Just opted to do it my way.
   1064957|00000000||Worked out in the end. That's important. Thanks for your help.
   1064959|00000000||Don't mention it. Farewell.
   1049623|00000000||Must be. And the lioness is best not vexed, so time I was on my way. Farewell, Cerys.
   1049626|00000000||See you, witcher.
   1049614|00000000||Farewell.
   1049613|00000000||Yen - why're you even interested?
   1049616|00000000||Though I will admit you're not all bad. You trusted me - a complete stranger nearly. Few would've had the courage.
    495525|00000000||Appreciate it if you didn't tell everybody in the Isles. They'll think I enjoy being dominated…
    495530|00000000||Haha. Farewell, Geralt.
    495532|00000000||See you, Cerys.
    495498|00000000||Geralt! Wait!
    495499|00000000||What is it?
    495502|00000000||When I spoke of men, how they're… about you and Yennefer…
    495504|00000000||About how she's wound me tight around her finger?
    495513|00000000||I was wrong to say that, wrong about you. The way you trusted me, a complete stranger almost - it was something.
    495527|00000000||Few men would've had the courage.
    502319|00000000||Thought we already discussed that.
    502321|00000000||We did. Farewell, witcher! Favorable winds and following seas to you!
    502323|00000000||To you too. So long.
    502327|00000000||Good idea. Then what? What're your plans?
    502313|00000000||I'll stay a few days, make sure he's healthy. And you? Gonna stay on Spikeroog?
    502315|00000000||Don't know yet. Gotta gather my thoughts.
    502317|00000000||I'm sure Yennefer must be growin' impatient…
    502302|00000000||I feel… as if someone's torn something from me.
    502303|00000000||That's normal. The hym was a parasite. Bonds between parasites and hosts can be strong. That's why you feel empty now.
    502305|00000000||Give it a few days, weeks, you'll be fine.
    502307|00000000||Thank you… I think. Farewell.
    502326|00000000||I'll go with him. He seems confused.
    502298|00000000||You'll be fine. Key is to not give in to self-pity.
    502294|00000000||You'll be fine.
    502287|00000000||What's happening? My head's spinning… I'm spinning in a maelstrom…
    502289|00000000||Geralt, you said it was over.
    502291|00000000||That's just fatigue. In time his mind'll return to normal.
    502293|00000000||What… what will I do now?
    502333|00000000||Well?!
    502334|00000000||It worked.
    502280|00000000||Let's get out of here.
    488853|00000000||We tricked the hym. It thought I'd killed your child, abandoned you to haunt me, feed on my conscience.
   1065890|00000000||But when it saw the babe was whole, unharmed, it had to go. You're free, Jarl!
    488855|00000000||Free…
    481363|00000000||That was useless. Others've defeated Ulle before me, and he's always come back. Gotta think of something else.
   1024615|00000000||And what if Craven told the truth? What if he didn't abandon us, but was--
   1024617|00000000||Stop. I won't speak of him.
   1024619|00000000||He was our brother in blood. We sailed on the same longship, sat oar to oar. Raided the Black Ones together.
   1024621|00000000||But when they attacked, he fled. Abandoned his mum and sis. Abandoned us all.
    560891|00000000||Let's get to work. Search every nook, turn things upside down if need be.
    560892|00000000||Think he'd be dumb enough to leave any evidence behind?
    587843|00000000||He didn't expect to be pursued… Might not've managed to take everything.
    572923|00000000||Heard Svana let you join the Pursuits… but have you truly the courage to run?
    572929|00000000||Mhm. Let's do this.
    572932|00000000||Listen up, good folk! Riding for the glory of Modron Freya today are… Geralt of Rivia! Arve Oarsman! And Red Rikka!
    572926|00000000||Let's do this.
    572928|00000000||Got plenty of courage… But I need to do something first. See you.
    572927|00000000||Gimme a minute.
   1049119|00000000||Will ye accept the challenge, witcher? Will ye race?
    163464|00000000||Ho-ho-ho! Congratulations on a job well done!
    163466|00000000||Ah, we gave it our best. Just one thing left - a figurehead for the prow, somethin' real fittin'.
    163468|00000000||What's there to think on? Carve it to look like me Sigrida!
    163472|00000000||She'll scare off krakens and put storms to shame with the fury on her brow!
    163768|00000000||I see you've used ash wood…
    163770|00000000||You see right.
    163772|00000000||Told ye I had some premium pine in me store.
    163774|00000000||Premium, aye - and dear as a devil's tears.
   1050007|00000000||Ye can skimp on your hut, your grub, your horse… but not on your boat. Or you'll go down with it.
    163776|00000000||Sixteen pair of oars? Who's the longboat for?
    163778|00000000||Madman Lugos ordered it.
    163780|00000000||Aaah! That explains it. Penile compensation, as I see it.
   1085742|00000000||Merchant
   1023124|00000000||They took it all. Fox hides I was to bring to market, Erin's baubles, coin…
   1023126|00000000||Old Gudmund always said ye shouldn't leave valuables at home. Ye gotta bury them somewhere.
   1023128|00000000||Aye, he did. And after he died, his sons spent a week in the woods with shovels and didn't find diddly.
   1050150|00000000||Thanks to you we can live without fear again…
   1054035|00000000||And 'midst Torgeir the Red's crew there was even… a warrior from the Continent!
   1054037|00000000||Whoa! Really?
   1054039|00000000||Ye better believe it. Gerd was his name. Swifter in battle than a snow leopard!
   1054041|00000000||Scorned the axe, he did, severin' heads with two swords.
   1054043|00000000||Died at Castle Tuirseach when the Black Ones o'erran An Skellig.
   1054045|00000000||Grandda, tell us another tale o' Gerd!
   1054047|00000000||They say he had a sword made o' moon steel. Or silver, don't rightly remember…
   1054049|00000000||He'd go off huntin' trolls, and they say sirens fled at the sight of 'im.
   1054051|00000000||He stuck true by the jarl. Lamentable the day when he breathed his last 'neath a pile of rubble…
   1054053|00000000||Stead o' dyin' in battle, as befits a warrior of his ilk!
    372882|00000000||On a cold, distant shore - you're not there.
    372884|00000000||Cross the wide, somber sea - you're not there.
    372886|00000000||Then I left myself behind, Drove you from my heart and mind.
    372888|00000000||Cross the wide, somber sea - you're not there.
    462194|00000000||This's gotta be Yen's room. She always did like space.
    477337|00000000||And luxury…
    462196|00000000||Glamour… Scent of lilac and gooseberries, even with the lid on…
    464910|00000000||Taste hasn't changed.
    462198|00000000||Hm… The stuffed unicorn. She fixed it.
    462200|00000000||Tissaia de Vries, "The Poisoned Source" - still turns to it for inspiration.
    462204|00000000||No idea how she managed to bring so much clothing. Must've hired out a galleon.
    464912|00000000||As usual - black and white.
   1056450|00000000||Her megascope…? Guess she never goes anywhere without it.
   1056452|00000000||As Philippa Eilhart said, megascopes and toothbrushes - deeply personal possessions…
   1066783|00000000||Riiight… Just not something I'd ever wear. Buuut, what don't we do for our--
   1069168|00000000||Hm… Who exactly is she to me?
   1087851|00000000||A Nordling?
   1087853|00000000||I'm busy.
   1087855|00000000||Vagrant.
   1087857|00000000||Fire!
   1087859|00000000||A Nordling?
   1087861|00000000||White at the temples, but wields a mighty sword.
   1087863|00000000||Call that walkin'?
    460024|00000000||You're Kurisu?
    460026|00000000||Aye.
   1047777|00000000||Ran into your brother. He's scouring all Skellige for you.
   1047975|00000000||Ye know him? Truly? How is he?
   1047977|00000000||Fine. Mentioned some pirates had kidnapped you.
   1047970|00000000||Twas the most horrible night of me life… I remember fire, cries, and the clink of iron 'gainst iron… They herded us on a longship.
   1047972|00000000||Toward dawn a storm broke. It was mayhem, so I took advantage and jumped overboard.
    459957|00000000||I ran into your brother.
    459969|00000000||So long.
    459959|00000000||Farewell.
    459955|00000000||You don't seem like a priestess.
    459999|00000000||You a novice? 'Cause I'd never take you for a priestess…
    460001|00000000||Truly? Hmm, you've got a good eye, though a bit off in this case. I'm neither a priestess nor a novice. I escaped a pirate ship, was wounded - that's why I'm here.
   1047746|00000000||Sisters Astrid and Dalla found me on the beach, near dead. They brought me to the temple, watched o'er me. I owe them me life.
   1047981|00000000||You were lucky. Very.
   1047758|00000000||True. Soon as I get back to Blandare, me and me brother'll make an offerin' to Freya. And I thank ye for your help.
   1047760|00000000||Take care, now.
   1047748|00000000||Quite the adventure… Got a home to go back to? Or will you stay here?
   1047750|00000000||I've a brother on Ard Skellig. He's surely mad with grief, searchin' for me… Once I'm better, all better, I'll find a longship and head home.
    459997|00000000||Welcome to the Temple of Freya. I'm Kurisu. How can I help?
   1047795|00000000||Greetings, what brings ye here?
    330594|00000000||All the horns're empty.
   1086457|117b673b||An Craite Shieldmaiden
    439230|00000000||In the vision he went flying in that direction.
   1077254|00000000||Gods bless and reward you, witcher. Though I can give you only a modest gift. Come by me home, it's not far.
   1029610|00000000||Times've changed.
   1029612|00000000||Begone from here. You tread upon the Path of Warriors.
   1026133|00000000||Just so happens that's exactly what interests me. What is it?
   1026134|00000000||It is the road young An Skelligers follow into the world of grown warriors.
   1026135|00000000||Like to give it a try.
   1026136|00000000||You're neither young nor an An Skelliger, but if you want to learn the true meaning of bravery… go right ahead.
   1075737|00000000||Tell me about the mountain path.
   1075739|00000000||It leads along the crest of Mount Aardeklove. You'll find a crimson shawl at the peak. Bring that back as proof you've reached the path's end.
   1075748|00000000||Doesn't sound like much of a challenge…
   1075750|00000000||Clear you've not spent much time in our mountains.
   1021885|00000000||Mountain path - tell me about it.
   1029599|00000000||At the cavern's end a surprise awaits. Take what ye find there, bring it to me.
   1025653|00000000||A surprise? What kind?
   1025654|00000000||You'll see… so long as ye get to the end. So long as the harpies don't get ye.
   1075743|00000000||Can you tell me more about the underground path… this a cave of some sort?
   1075745|00000000||Aye, but the corridors leadin' to it are flooded. No Continental's ever managed to swim them. Takes trainin' since youth, a lot of divin' after pearls.
   1075741|00000000||We'll see about that. What else?
   1084430|00000000||Want to hear about the path that leads underground.
   1075754|00000000||Might give your path a try some day… Not today, though. So long.
   1021890|00000000||So long.
   1021889|00000000||I wanna try.
   1015262|00000000||Well, I'm not scared to try.
   1015263|00000000||Not just foreign, but dumb, too. Well, no curin' that.
   1025928|00000000||Well, run to the top of Mount Aardeklove, grab the crimson shawl. Then reach the cave. At its end ye'll find somethin' I'm not about to describe.
   1029595|00000000||On you go, then. Show the world what you're worth.
   1025950|00000000||Eager to walk the Path, but don't remember what he's to do. Heh.
   1029606|00000000||Climb to the top of Mount Aardeklove, retrieve the crimson shawl. Then reach the cavern at whose end you'll find somethin' I will not describe.
   1029608|00000000||Bring me that… with the shawl.
   1025944|00000000||What do I do to complete the Path of Warriors? Remind me.
   1015557|00000000||You again? Thought you'd wised up.
   1015558|00000000||Thought wrong.
   1015255|00000000||What do I do?
   1075732|00000000||Path's got two offshoots. One leads into mountain peaks, the other into the bowels o' the earth. Traverse both, and you'll 'ave proved your valor.
   1025754|00000000||Definitely not for those unlucky enough to land here. You Gunnar?
   1015243|00000000||Who's askin' and why?
   1015244|00000000||I wanna travel the Path of Warriors.
   1015245|00000000||No outlander's ever dared… But if you've had your fill of life… Go on, try.
   1029618|00000000||I don't know you, you don't know me… So what's your problem?
   1029620|00000000||These Isles were ours alone once. No foreigner dared set foot here. And if they did, they'd not return home. The good days, those…
   1015524|00000000||Second part's harder still. Ye'll enter a flooded cavern, have to swim its passages, all beneath water. Only men of these isles're capable of the feat.
   1015511|00000000||Second part of the trial - what's it entail?
   1015258|00000000||First you've gotta run the Warrior's Trail along the mountain's ridge. At the summit ye'll find a crimson shawl. That is, you'll find it if you make it there.
    576600|00000000||You lost… but to the best. Mere participating in the Great Race is cause for pride.
   1029257|00000000||Mhm. Damn near bursting with it. Till next time.
   1029261|00000000||Not bad, gotta admit. Don't know where I'll be a year from now… but I'll try to come back.
    576595|00000000||The Heroes' Pursuit is done! Geralt of Rivia has out ridden Astrid the Vipress! The White Wolf, our dark horse, has won!
    576598|00000000||Lovely race. The goddess must be pleased… As should you be, with your prize.
   1035296|00000000||Hm, guess I got company.
   1071125|00000000||Rejoice with us, Geralt! Eat, drink, celebrate my victory!
   1071123|00000000||Ahh, you can't win them all.
    478067|00000000||We shouldn't.
    478077|00000000||We shouldn't be breaking into Ermion's workshop.
    478079|00000000||If I didn't know you better I'd say you needed to grow a pair. But I know that you simply enjoy complaining - it's the only reason you said that.
    520648|00000000||Why would we go there?
    520568|00000000||To retrieve an item - the Mask of Uroboros. We'll need it and, therefore, must steal it.
    520570|00000000||Right, 'course.
    478069|00000000||Take it Ermion won't be there?
    478071|00000000||That's right.
    478073|00000000||And what's the purpose of this visit?
    478075|00000000||We're looking for an object - the Mask of Uroboros. We'll need it.
    478066|00000000||Let's go.
    476996|00000000||What now?
    476997|00000000||Now we pay a visit to Ermion's laboratory.
    476998|00000000||Didn't know we'd been invited.
    478050|00000000||Because we've not been.
   1056871|00000000||Now you'll tell me why you need this mask.
   1056873|00000000||Oh, I shall. In due course.
   1056875|00000000||Take you'll decide when.
   1056877|00000000||Correct.
   1057752|00000000||Come, Geralt.
    422292|00000000||Greetings, White Wolf. I suspected you'd come by. Bah, I was sure of it!
    422294|00000000||Oh yeah?
    422296|00000000||The best-stocked armory in all Skellige's right here at Kaer Trolde castle. Everyone knows it.
    422298|00000000||I'll gladly see for myself.
    422300|00000000||Take your time, give 'em all a careful look.
    422306|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
    422274|00000000||What do you have in stock?
    422308|00000000||Craft something for me, will you?
    422284|00000000||Willing to craft something for me?
   1086475|00000000||Let's play gwent.
    501004|00000000||Looking for someone who can make me a master-quality breastplate.
    501006|00000000||Hm. Never known a master who wasn't a dwarf.
    501008|00000000||Fergus, perhaps? Say he's holed up somewhere in Velen.
    501002|00000000||Can you make master-quality armor?
    422314|00000000||So long.
    422288|00000000||Farewell.
    422286|00000000||Who'll be crowned king?
    500964|00000000||Whaddaya think - who'll be the next king of the Isles?
    500966|00000000||Hjalmar, clear as day. Lad's brave and generous, and from Crach's own line. No better claimant.
    422302|00000000||So you're back. Was right, wasn't I?
    334730|02e65932||Bergthora
    464951|00000000||Huh. Someone walked through the mead.
    435915|00000000||Huh. Could you ask for clearer prints? Sticky from the mead.
    435917|00000000||Now I know why the door wouldn't open.
   1072713|00000000||Trail breaks off. Need to find another clue nearby, something else to follow.
   1023310|00000000||I want you to sew these rags together for me.
   1023391|00000000||The fabric's good, but… the sun of Nilfgaard?
   1023393|00000000||Black Ones' banners, captured on the Continent. Aim to lay 'em down on my floors.
   1050148|00000000||You're a good man, Geralt!
   1087816|00000000||What is it you wish?
   1087818|00000000||We serve Her who is Virgin, Mother and Crone.
   1087820|00000000||Away with you.
   1087822|00000000||Watch your strut!
   1074364|00000000||Decided to keep me company?
   1074366|00000000||Never know what might come at you deep in a dark forest.
   1074368|00000000||You think someone may wish to hurt me?
   1074370|00000000||Think I should warn off anyone who'd be dumb enough to try.
   1074372|00000000||Ugh, witchers. I see you're inclined to respond to the call of the wild…
   1074374|00000000||Ah, fine. In that case, meet me at Larvik.
    480695|00000000||I'm guessing you have a plan…
    480701|00000000||Take it you've got a plan?
    480703|00000000||No, I just like to stare at rotting flesh!
    489816|00000000||All right… got the key!
    497122|00000000||Let's meet up top! Move it!
    480708|00000000||That's Yen… Charming as ever.
    480710|00000000||C'mon. Someone wants to meet you.
    497124|00000000||We'll talk when you get here, all right?
    480697|00000000||Yen… there's no point…
    480699|00000000||There's no point in discussing this through a grate!
    480694|00000000||What's the point?
    477813|00000000||Damn… Dead… has been for a while.
    480676|00000000||Yen! Found him!
    480678|00000000||And?
    480680|00000000||And I've seen rotfiends in better condition than this.
    477814|00000000||Shit…
    477816|00000000||Fine, scrape together what you can and haul the bits up here!
    489815|00000000||All right… But I don't know how to get out!
    497119|00000000||You'll think of something!
    389627|00000000||I don't know yet.
    389641|00000000||Haven't decided what to do yet.
    389643|00000000||Try to kill the Woodland Spirit and you'll bring his wrath upon us all.
    389625|00000000||Better to just kill the leshen.
    389661|00000000||There's no guarantee your method will work. And the risks are great. Probably easier to just kill the leshen.
    389635|00000000||If the Spirit dies, all game will leave the woods. Our men will lose their strength, and our women will be rendered barren. It will be the end of us all - that was our covenant.
    389637|00000000||Still better than certain death.
    389639|00000000||You're not from here, you don't understand. Death is nothing to us, pride is everything.
    389649|00000000||Gotta give this some thought. So long.
    389647|00000000||We'll see.
    389645|00000000||I'll start with your method.
    389657|00000000||Fine. I'll try it your way. But if it fails, I'll have to kill the beast.
    389659|00000000||Wise choice. The Spirit will subject you to trial. But you cannot succumb. Succeed in renewing the covenant and I'll spare no gold in rewarding you.
    389623|00000000||I'll try it your way.
    389629|00000000||Back by the tree, you said you know another way to stop the leshen.
    389631|00000000||We must return to the old path, restore the old ways. Roam the woods with knife and spear. Fight on even terms and prove our valor. That would please him.
    389633|00000000||Our ancestors placed the Covenant Stone in the woods. Laid sacrifices of prized game on it and thus made a pact.
    393273|00000000||Do as they did. Go south, along the brook. Submit to the trial by burning a sacrifice of wolves' hearts on the sacred spot.
    389688|00000000||Is there another way?
    389690|00000000||Your Spirit's a monster, plain and simple.
    389704|00000000||Maybe I wasn't clear. The Woodland Spirit is a monster. Cut with a sword he'll bleed and die, like you, like me.
    389706|00000000||He's much more. Thanks to him the woods teem with game, and our women bear strong babes. The power of the Woodland Spirit makes us the best hunters in the Isles.
    394409|00000000||True, not every lad who sets out to be a hunter survives the sacred ritual. But aren't witchers made at similar cost?
    389615|00000000||Didn't have many friends, did he?
    389617|00000000||Folk aren't willing to look at this kind of death today, but in the past…
    393586|00000000||I remember… I was just a lad. Lugos Harelip led a raid on our village. Found nothing but silence and fog. I could barely make out my pa and my uncles, lyin' in wait behind the trees…
    393588|00000000||I remember how they hunted down one warrior after another. And once they surrounded Harelip himself… well, I believe he'd rather have faced the Woodland Spirit.
    389619|00000000||Your Spirit is a very old leshen. He's dangerous, but I should be able to deal with him.
    389621|00000000||Rid us of him? Yet he's what made us invincible, turned us into great warriors.
   1064188|00000000||Place is creepy. I don't like it.
   1064438|00000000||Nor do I.
   1064440|00000000||Anyone here when this happened had a slim chance of surviving.
   1064190|00000000||I know what you're thinking…
   1064192|00000000||But don't worry. Ciri can take care of herself.
   1068909|00000000||Hm… All those years… I actually wondered what you'd look like…
   1068911|00000000||And? Disappointed?
   1068913|00000000||You've not changed at all.
   1069172|00000000||Expect me to? What, coulda dyed my hair black. The Black Wolf… How's that sound?
   1069174|00000000||People change. Men go bald… or grow beards…
   1068915|00000000||Willing to let mine fill in… If you enjoy being scratched.
    354065|00000000||Geralt, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
    354067|00000000||Hm?
    434358|00000000||Your beard. Why'd you decide to grow it out?
    434360|00000000||Don't really know.
    524115|00000000||Hm.
    434362|00000000||Must say it suits you.
    480391|00000000||Might be her… Might be her companion, or someone else altogether, connected to them both… I don't know.
    480283|00000000||Do you think… Is there a chance that thing might be Ciri? That… well… she's been transformed by some curse?
    480285|00000000||Don't even want to think about it.
    480287|00000000||Geralt… We must.
    480279|00000000||The ugly creature - it's linked to Ciri somehow.
    480289|00000000||Key to finding Ciri is that ugly… thing Skjall saw on the beach. That's what I think.
    480293|00000000||In Velen… Local ruler, a baron, keeps him at his castle. Told me he won him in a card game in Novigrad.
    480295|00000000||You must go and get the creature. I don't know - buy him, kidnap him…
    480297|00000000||Won't be necessary. Baron owes me a favor. A big one.
    480335|00000000||Seems early to me. What would I do with him? Cart him around while I searched for Ciri and hunted monsters?
    480337|00000000||He's safe where he is, with the baron - least I think so. I'll get him once I know why Ciri went to Novigrad, what she did there… Still a chance I might find her there.
    480339|00000000||All right… I'll keep my fingers crossed.
    480393|00000000||Now tell me - do you…? No, never mind.
    480299|00000000||The thing's clearly cursed - its mind is a jumble… Can't have anything resembling a normal conversation with it.
    480301|00000000||Grumbling won't get us anywhere. All will be well. A curse? Please. Nothing a sorceress and a witcher couldn't handle.
   1057730|00000000||In Velen. At a castle until recently ruled by a self-proclaimed baron. Now controlled by his right hand man, Sergeant Ardal.
    480291|00000000||You know… I saw something… or someone who looked just like that.
    482140|00000000||Where?
    480389|00000000||Might be… From what I know she was looking to cure a powerful curse while in Novigrad.
    480399|00000000||But I'll lose it if I try to deal with that possibility now. We have to do what we can… See what happens.
    480275|00000000||What did you want to say?
    480401|00000000||You were gonna ask me something. What was it?
    480403|00000000||Tell me…
    480395|00000000||You must see Donar, ask him to whom exactly he sold the… thing.
    480397|00000000||Not coming with me?
    481872|00000000||You know… I'm better off not showing myself to him now.
    480277|00000000||We know Ciri's not in Skellige.
    480303|00000000||Didn't learn much. Though… though we can be sure Ciri's not in Skellige anymore.
    480313|00000000||Not in Velen or Novigrad, either… She's disappeared. Again.
    480315|00000000||Perhaps we should reexamine what we've learned. We might've missed a clue that would push us forward…
    480317|00000000||Certainly hope that's the case.
    480309|00000000||Not in Velen either… Leaves Novigrad - world's biggest city.
    480311|00000000||No one said it would be easy.
    480307|00000000||She disappeared from Novigrad, too. Checked that… Maybe she's in Velen, hiding somewhere.
    480305|00000000||Maybe she's in Velen, hiding somewhere. Or in Novigrad - world's largest city…
    480319|00000000||Better to have some idea where to look than none.
    480405|00000000||Ugh. Makes me wonder what she's gotten herself into.
    480407|00000000||Can't even begin to imagine. But we will pull her out of it, safe and sound. That I promise you.
    482176|00000000||Yen… you didn't have to do that.
    499579|00000000||But I wanted to.
    482178|00000000||I'd rather not talk about it. We must focus on what Skjall told us.
    480273|00000000||What now?
   1056617|00000000||Ciri's trail in Skellige - we've followed it, exhausted the possibilities… Might be time to go back to the Continent.
   1009242|00000000||Before you do, there's one thing… It's important.
   1009244|00000000||What's that?
   1009246|00000000||Let's meet in Larvik, at the warriors' hall. We'll speak there.
    497436|00000000||I must search the palace library. Perhaps I'll find something about this ugly creature Skjall saw, something to tell us who… or what it is.
    480323|00000000||I refuse to report to him.
    480362|00000000||I refuse. Don't have the slightest intention of reporting to him.
    480364|00000000||Fine… I can't force you.
    480341|00000000||See you, Yen. Take care of yourself.
   1056635|00000000||Wait.
   1056638|00000000||This matter in Larvik - it really is important to me. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tarry.
    480327|00000000||If we gotta, we gotta. So be it.
    480329|00000000||We'd never have known Ciri had returned if not for Emhyr and his agents. We owe him this.
    480321|00000000||So be it.
    480325|00000000||Awfully loyal of you…
    480331|00000000||Being awfully loyal to your patron.
    480333|00000000||He's your patron as well, dear. Don't forget that lest he remind you of it himself.
    480356|00000000||After all, we do owe the emperor a report.
    480358|00000000||Ciri's our concern. Ours alone.
    480360|00000000||Perhaps. But that is not what we agreed with Emhyr. We must see him.
   1056629|00000000||Can we do this later…? Sorry, need to take care of something.
   1056631|00000000||Well, if you must, you must. I shall wait for you in Larvik for a time. If you don't make it, we’ll meet in Vizima.
   1056619|00000000||Need a bit of time. Gotta tend to something first.
   1056618|00000000||Fine. See you in Larvik.
   1056621|00000000||Fine. Larvik. See you there soon.
   1056623|00000000||Thank you. For that… and for your help in the garden. I'd not have managed without you.
   1056625|00000000||It was nothing.
   1056627|00000000||Geralt, you know me. I'm rare to praise, but when I do, it is sincere.
    480409|00000000||I'll go see Donar… Then I'll leave Skellige.
    480281|00000000||It's time to go. Leave Skellige. At least for now…
    497441|00000000||Take care, Yen.
    497442|00000000||I'll miss you…
    480437|00000000||Gonna miss you.
    480439|00000000||Geralt, don't… There's nothing more pathetic than a sorceress in tears.
    480441|00000000||Not appropriate for a sorceress to show emotion?
    480443|00000000||No more than it is for a witcher.
    480445|00000000||No one's watching.
    480452|00000000||I shall go as well… I fear I won't be welcome here after our talk with Skjall.
    497438|00000000||Where will you go?
    497456|00000000||To Vizima. I've not yet repaid Emhyr all I owe him…
    480354|00000000||Where'll we meet once I get Uma from the baron?
   1001907|00000000||Ye hear? Seafiends killed Dagur. Poor Tove…
   1001908|00000000||High time somebody took care o' them.
   1039681|00000000||A few've tried already. Now they live at the bottom with the beasts.
   1002093|00000000||Whoa there, witcher! Ye lookin' for work, by any chance?
    491961|00000000||Can't do that. Jonna doesn't deserve it.
    491964|00000000||And my son?! Does he?!
    505466|00000000||No. But he doesn't have to die. You have a choice.
   1068076|00000000||All right! If it'll save Tjalve, I'll go back to the hussy. And you… best not see your face round here again.
    491959|00000000||Can't do that.
    491965|00000000||You might deserve to be punished… but not this way. Fine. I'll do it.
    491966|00000000||Thanks be to the gods!
    491967|00000000||Don't bring the gods into it. This is between two human beings.
    491960|00000000||So be it.
    491953|00000000||Old friend of yours… Jonna.
    491954|00000000||I might've guessed. Jealous bitch, can't stand to see others happy! So? Will she lift the curse?
    491955|00000000||Yeah, sure. All you gotta do is renounce your family and go back to her.
    491956|00000000||Nay. Never! My wife, my son - I'd strip them of honor, condemn them to poverty! You've gotta break the spell, witcher! Let her die!
    491950|00000000||Your old friend, Jonna.
    491952|00000000||We'll talk later.
    491951|00000000||I'll be back.
    491949|00000000||So? You know who placed the Nithing?
    488181|00000000||What can I do?
    579043|00000000||What can I do? Get your family?
    592695|00000000||You won't manage. Be journeyin' to meet me ancestors soon.
    592696|00000000||Pour a nip off for me atimes. For Jorund… son of Sigvald. Who lived honorable, and died like a fool.
    578895|00000000||Stay calm. Get you a healer.
    578896|00000000||No point… Pierced me lung. I'll drown in me own blood ere too long.
    488180|00000000||Get you a healer.
    488194|00000000||So many raids. Wars. Duels.
    488196|00000000||Only to die at the hands of some miserable shits…
    435597|00000000||When I get my hands on that pyromaniac--
    560519|00000000||Let's think… They had to use the entrance we used… Maybe they left some prints behind?
    560524|00000000||Maybe. When the door slammed shut and the fire broke out, did you hear a bottle shatter, too?
    560526|00000000||No, but I've no witcher senses at my disposal. You must hear the hair growin' on my head.
    560527|00000000||Huh, I try not to eavesdrop. Anyway, entrance is worth checking. Come on.
    560783|00000000||We've gotta search his room.
    560784|00000000||Lead the way.
   1070501|00000000||So? Find anythin'?
   1070503|00000000||Mhm. Arnvald's body… And this key. Had it on him.
   1024560|00000000||Hah! Take that, you boar! You're dead!
   1024562|00000000||Owwww! Stop it! Why'm I always the boar?
   1024564|00000000||Cause you're fat! Hahaaha!
   1024566|00000000||Apologize to her, Mikkel. Or you'll be the boar, and I'll wield the stick.
   1006019|00000000||Looks like blood but… Hm, red clay.
   1042065|00000000||Tracks - a nekker… A big one.
   1008528|00000000||An ambush… average nekker's too dumb to set one… maybe this is no average nekker.
   1008558|00000000||Nekker nest. Nothing left of it, but it could be connected to a bigger one.
   1028862|00000000||Found a good place for their nest.
   1008650|00000000||Pops mold. Dijkstra's antidote should come in handy.
   1008648|00000000||Pops mold. Can't go in without an antidote.
   1009385|00000000||If I follow them, I bet they'll lead me to the nest. Should be able to hear where they run…
   1042789|00000000||Hm, nekker warriors use this clay to mark their position in the pack.
   1042728|00000000||Tracks lead into the woods.
   1041794|00000000||Red clay and the tracks of an exceptionally large nekker. Definitely a warrior.
   1045531|00000000||Must be around…
   1036583|00000000||Hm, something really did tear him to pieces…
   1033231|5112967a||Merchant
    457298|00000000||Beasts have risen from the shadows. Ragh nar Roog.
    587998|00000000||Drink, revel. Laughter's music to the gods' ears.
   1021931|00000000||What're you lookin' for? Amber?
   1021933|00000000||Nay. Gold.
   1021935|00000000||Oughtn't ye look in the river… Usin' a sieve or somethin'.
   1021937|00000000||You don't understand a thing. Our lads sunk a Nilfgaard ship full o' loot. I'm thinkin' the waves'll toss somethin' ashore…
    457249|00000000||We've angered the gods…
    587985|00000000||Finally, a chance to frolic a bit… My mind clear, my conscience clear…
    583753|00000000||May I?
    583755|00000000||You must, even! Come, I've been waiting for you.
    583757|00000000||So, feast to your liking? Any better than your Continental "balls"?
    583759|00000000||Definitely more to drink.
    583761|00000000||Aye, there is. Rolled all of it out of my cellars! Double meads, triple, Cintrian plum brandy, Mahakaman spirit that burns the mouth like boiling water. Clan an Craite knows the meaning of hospitality!
    583763|00000000||Guessing there's an ulterior motive to your hospitality.
    583773|00000000||Something tells me there's a purpose to your hospitality.
    583776|00000000||Aye, there is. In the Isles, mead and meat stand to gain you as much support as feats accomplished blade in hand.
    583778|00000000||If that's true, you can rest easy about how the vote'll turn out.
    583780|00000000||I'll rest easy on the morrow. When the crown rests on one of my children's heads.
   1070326|00000000||You and Birna talked. What about?
   1070328|00000000||Saw you talking to Birna. What about?
   1070330|00000000||Politics. After all, naught else interests her.
   1070333|00000000||Wench tried to convince me that we must honor Bran's memory. And to that aim, I'm to command my offspring to withdraw from the race for the crown... support Svanrige, instead.
   1070335|00000000||Why do I think you turned her down?
   1070337|00000000||You put it mildly. I showed her the door!
    583762|00000000||About that reward…
    583764|00000000||Not torn between Hjalmar and Cerys?
    583782|00000000||Feeling torn between Hjalmar and Cerys?
    583784|00000000||You mean, do I have a favorite? Nay. They're as different as fire and water. But an Craite blood flows in both.
    583786|00000000||Hjalmar isn't too hot-tempered to be king?
    439896|00000000||Between you and me… Hjalmar's not too hot-headed to be king?
    439898|00000000||Depends on the kind of king you have in mind. Want one who'll send emissaries, move figurines about a map, calculate the most profitable option. Then yes, he's too hot-headed.
    439900|00000000||But Skellige wants a different ruler. The kind who'll drown Nilfgaard in blood, sooner jump into a fire than surrender. And that is Hjalmar.
    445053|00000000||If you escalate your attacks, you stand to infuriate Emhyr. Could regret it someday.
    445055|00000000||In Skellige we spit on the notion of peace at any cost.
    583787|00000000||Think Skellige will listen to a woman?
    583815|00000000||Think the council of jarls will dare to put a woman on the throne?
    583817|00000000||If you'd asked me some months ago, I'd 'ave laughed in your face.
    583819|00000000||But today I see, and I'm not alone, that Cerys has something as rare in the Isles as a hot summer - patience.
    583821|00000000||Others act, then think. She's different. She thinks things through - the for, the against. But once she takes action, not a force in the world could stop her.
    583785|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
    583807|00000000||Promised me a reward for helping your children.
    583809|00000000||And I aim to keep my word. Here. This bauble's been in the family for generations. I give it you for helping ensure the line endures.
    583811|00000000||Beautiful craftsmanship. Thanks.
    583813|00000000||Heh, I'm the one--
    586087|00000000||Lu-gos! Lu-gos! Lu-gos!
    431044|00000000||Hear that? Dammit, Hjalmar's probably started another row.
    431046|00000000||That's not Hjalmar. Let's go.
    581104|0001a645||Mia
   1041747|00000000||Cages open. Beasts released.
   1041749|00000000||Liquidation terminated. Insufficient resources to continue.
   1041743|00000000||Intruder in laboratory. Commencing beast teleportation.
   1040263|00000000||Bavumar, agveaste cypfyanswm!
   1040261|00000000||Gryv'vir c'lathu aryghsterle!
   1040251|00000000||Palynthe orval agavhar!
   1042416|00000000||Osva'yl yfferen advygiât!
   1074426|00000000||I shall cast a spell, try to smash that barrier.
   1042732|00000000||Intruder detected. Commencing annihilation.
   1041770|00000000||Acute threat to control systems. Immediate action required.
   1041772|00000000||Encroachment detected. Initiating emergency measures.
   1041768|00000000||Defensive Regulatory Magicon threatened.
   1041774|00000000||Defensive Regulatory Magicon deactivated. All control lost.
   1041764|00000000||Isolation chamber open.
   1042730|00000000||Disturbing indications of freedom.
   1050129|00000000||There's a monster. Up comes a witcher and… monster's gone!
    522040|00000000||No challengers to be seen?! Can't believe it! Were Bran alive, he'd whoop and holler in your faces!
    522041|00000000||Ha! We've a guest! Geralt of Rivia himself's come to put you to shame!
    172126|00000000||Hjalmar will never be king. The gods have cursed the lands of the an Craites.
    172128|00000000||You don't believe in the gods, Lugos.
    172130|00000000||But I've seen them woods! They're cursed!
    172132|00000000||So maybe the gods do exist?
    172134|00000000||Find me a king who'll kill a god and plough a goddess, and I'm his man.
    551352|00000000||Soothsayers augured the truth…
    550947|00000000||A fine beauty, golden-haired and ruddy-cheeked…
    550949|00000000||And her mum went and gave her up to Freya!
    550951|00000000||If you're gonna talk rubbish, best not talk at all.
    550960|00000000||Mmm… Mm… Maybe just... invite her for a snifter? At the inn?
    550962|00000000||Got fuck all to do with me…
    551354|00000000||Cheers.
    551356|00000000||Good day!
    551358|00000000||Workin'. Don't bother me.
    551368|00000000||Interest you in a longship?
    551360|00000000||Hands off our girls or I'll…
    551370|00000000||… and ugly as a sea devil.
    551362|00000000||Watch yerself.
    551364|00000000||Dammit, I'm a boat builder, not a blacksmith!
    551366|00000000||I don't wanna die…
    585070|00000000||Send men to Fornhala, then you'll believe.
    585116|00000000||Send men to Fornhala, then you'll believe.
    585118|00000000||Been there. A shabby village, a few huts. What's there of interest?
    585120|00000000||A temple: to Svalblod.
    585122|00000000||Go on, Hjalmar.
    585124|00000000||What about? I found the traitors, wrought vengeance on them. That's everything.
    589804|00000000||No, not everything. The Vildkaarls conspired with someone. Found a letter on one of their corpses.
    585126|00000000||Vague. This does not identify the guilty party.
    585128|00000000||That's not why we've gathered.
    585134|00000000||You washed away disgrace with the blood of our foes, Hjalmar. I, eldest among the jarls, cleanse your clan's name.
    589806|00000000||We part in peace.
    585110|00000000||I'll vouch for Hjalmar.
    585112|00000000||Why would we believe you, eh? You're a lackey to an Craite.
    585114|00000000||And a witcher. He knows beasts, including those that take on human form.
    585069|00000000||I vouch for what Hjalmar said.
    559915|00000000||It was them attacked us. The Vildkaarls.
    585064|00000000||Will you claim they turned into bears? That they're the berserkers our nanny's scared us with as children? Is that it?
    585066|00000000||I saw them transform. With my own eyes.
    585068|00000000||Did you see Freya ride by astride a wild boar as well?
    587730|00000000||You've discovered as much as your sister. That's to say, nothin'.
   1084653|ea54b6d5||Rabid rock troll
   1023448|00000000||Next raid I'm goin' with 'em!
   1023450|00000000||So who'll mind the sheep?
   1023452|00000000||Someone who's fit for it. The gods made me to wield an axe!
    391265|00000000||If Sven's father were alive, he'd give that boy's rump a good strappin'.
    391267|00000000||What if Sven's talkin' sense? Maybe the elders are to blame for this?
    391269|00000000||What's he know? Used to be youngsters knew their place and kept quiet.
    391271|00000000||Dah, it's a shame our hunters perished in the war.
    391279|00000000||Not goin' to Arnulf's funeral?
    391281|00000000||I don't generally go in search of misfortune.
    391285|00000000||Spirit's on the hunt for a new soul now.
   1036610|00000000||Aaargh! Not this way! The door!
   1036609|00000000||Can't stand that sensation.
   1036866|00000000||Must be the key.
   1040204|00000000||What a pigsty. Be hard to find anything here.
   1040206|00000000||Hm, what's going on here?
   1047398|00000000||Damn tower wants to gas me.
   1047400|00000000||Great, portal closed.
   1036865|00000000||Hmm… Looked smaller from the outside.
   1036608|00000000||A portal… Shit.
   1049688|00000000||Have you heard? Magnus Stronghand's dead.
   1049690|00000000||It can't be. Why, he's the best axeman on the isle!
   1049692|00000000||Yet he's dead. Went out to hunt that devilry prowlin' the highroad…
   1049694|00000000||Sverre said it tore him to shreds. Not a finger left of Stronghand.
    171105|ba136f47||Wild Dog
    498098|00000000||Somebody could break their leg… or their neck.
    582732|00000000||Quick now! All the jarls've gathered!
    585174|00000000||Coronation's begun already!
    585180|00000000||Hjalmar an Craite, Skellige's new king! The gods will favor us!
    585178|00000000||Cerys an Craite, Skellige's new queen! The gods will favor us!
   1008604|00000000||If he died while being teleported, seal might still be on him…
   1008607|00000000||Behold!
   1008609|00000000||Bravo. Come to the deck, I've an idea.
   1008534|00000000||Need to search his body.
   1008535|00000000||Think the djinn killed him?
   1007779|00000000||Think the djinn did this to him?
   1007780|00000000||No, it wouldn't attack its master. This looks rather like an unfortunate accident.
   1008539|00000000||When the storm broke, Amos must've uttered a wish like, "Take us away, anywhere, to a mountaintop, even." And the djinn granted the wish literally.
   1008540|00000000||They had a hard landing, Amos was thrown off his feet and against the wall. The bookcase did the rest.
   1008575|00000000||Always knew too much studying could kill you.
   1008533|00000000||It's Amos. Looks exactly like the etching in the book. Except his head was intact there.
    593442|00000000||Yen, think you should see this.
    593443|00000000||What do you have?
    433522|00000000||Dammit!
    435191|00000000||Looking to discourage me?
    435193|00000000||Good. Means you're scared.
    433518|00000000||Ciri!
    433520|00000000||No, it's impossible!
    385792|00000000||Ciri… Zireael… Can you hear me?
    385794|00000000||I can…
    387240|00000000||I must leave you now. We will meet beneath Drowned Dead Rock. Can you remember?
    387242|00000000||Mhm…
    436330|00000000||Repeat it.
    436332|00000000||Drowned… Dead… Rock…
    497272|00000000||Don't stare, help me.
    497275|00000000||Help us both.
    495300|00000000||Where's Yennefer?
    495343|00000000||Hmm… Don't know… Why do you ask?
    495301|00000000||I just wonder why she let you come here alone.
    495352|00000000||What do you mean, "let me"?
    495357|00000000||Nothin', not a thing… Just got the impression she doesn't like to let you out of her sight.
    487950|00000000||Look, there they are.
    487952|00000000||Horridly bright out here. Stings the eyes.
    487956|00000000||The fresh air will do you good.
    501235|00000000||The gods won't be pleased.
    487963|00000000||Ahem
    487965|00000000||Jarl, our guests, remember?
    492517|00000000||What happened?
    493161|00000000||What happened to your hand?
    493178|00000000||I sacrificed it to the gods.
    501172|00000000||Forgive him, Jarl. Geralt's got more to learn about our customs.
    501174|00000000||We're close to the gods in Skellige. And the chummier y'are are, the greater the offerin' you make.
    501196|00000000||It's our belief the greatest thing a man can offer is his pain, his suffering - the pure sacrifice.
    493181|00000000||To hear the gods is a gift, not a sacrifice.
    492516|00000000||About those voices…
    493197|00000000||Couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
    493248|00000000||No worries. It's no secret.
    493250|00000000||All in the Isles know Jarl Udalryk hears the voices of the gods.
    493159|00000000||These voices you hear…
    493185|00000000||The gods. Their voices.
    487989|00000000||It's not the gods.
    487991|00000000||Watch your words, foreigner. You're in Skellige, our land, and we revere the gods here. If you weren't an Craite's guest…
    501200|00000000||Jarl, the witcher surely meant no offense. Let us hear what he has to say.
    487986|00000000||They aren't the gods'.
    487987|00000000||This is about your brother.
    488001|00000000||More likely this is somehow related to your dead brother.
    488015|00000000||I told Geralt of Aki. We concluded that--
    501212|00000000||That the gods are angry at you, yet he's the reason. That's why you have to apologize - to Aki himself.
    488042|00000000||I… I didn't want to… Aki fell in the water… I… the gods will be angry.
    488130|00000000||Remember where Aki fell in the water?
    488132|00000000||Near the isle's eastern end, by the mouth of the bay. Current had swept us towards Ulula's Needle.
    488144|00000000||It's a dangerous spot. Treacherous eddies swallow a handful of sailors each year.
    488134|00000000||We need to sail there. Aki's ghost won't rest until Brokvar's returned to his remains.
    488136|00000000||No, no, no, no!
    493238|00000000||The gods. They'll be angry… I feel it.
    488148|00000000||Fear not, Jarl. The gods love you, and they loved Aki. Surely they want this.
    488143|00000000||Well, maybe I can sail there. The sword should be returned - that's what matters. Makes no difference by whose hand.
    488151|00000000||What do I look for? Did Aki have anything that'll help me recognize him? Something he was wearing that could survive all this time under water?
    488167|00000000||Aye… Our clan ring.
    488171|00000000||That oughta be enough. I'm off.
    501284|00000000||What would you have me do?
    488100|00000000||Lemme help you. And I promise to do everything I can to keep from angering the gods.
    488101|00000000||Heed the witcher, Jarl. Make amends to Aki and you'll surely please the gods.
    501265|00000000||Don't be afraid.
    501264|00000000||The gods are that cruel?
    501269|00000000||Angry you want to make peace with your brother? Are the gods of Skellige that cruel?
    501279|00000000||They are that just.
    501280|00000000||Justice demands you return to the dead what is rightly theirs.
    501289|00000000||We have to return his sword.
    501292|00000000||You've made the right choice.
    501298|00000000||I believe so as well.
    501290|00000000||Thanks for your trust.
    478311|ce75940e||Thug
    551315|00000000||No such thing as bad ships or bad weather. Only worthless fuckin' sailors.
    166412|00000000||Man needs worries like a boat needs ballast, to sail straight and even.
    166436|00000000||Go on, lad.
    551307|00000000||Ugh. Rain's back again.
    550931|00000000||You believe that damage was done in battle?
    550933|00000000||Drunkards ran smack into an iceberg! That's what snapped their oars!
    550966|00000000||Some she-beast's taken to slaughterin' lumberjacks. That's why we got so little wood comin' from the sawmill.
    550935|00000000||Ha!
    550968|00000000||Aye. Heard that elsewheres.
    550937|00000000||How'd he make his fortune? Honest raidin' and plunderin'?
    550939|00000000||Where'd ye get that foolish notion?
    551309|00000000||Favorable winds to ye!
    551313|00000000||Scared me shitless!
    551321|00000000||Aye?
    551311|00000000||Mhm?
    551317|00000000||Take a hammer to ye!
    551319|00000000||Heeeeelp!
    393534|00000000||This celandine should help you. Won't mend your leg, but it will make it hurt less.
    393536|00000000||Thanks, our undyin' gratitude that gets ye!
    393970|00000000||The gratitude of a dyin' man, in my case. Enjoy it while it lasts.
    393972|00000000||Shut it and show me that leg!
    461138|00000000||Thanks again. Gods guide ye.
    393530|00000000||Got some medicine for you.
   1049954|00000000||Pretty common herb. Must be a bush around here. I'll get you some.
   1050054|00000000||Thanks.
   1049803|00000000||I'll find some for you.
    377365|00000000||What happened?
    377367|00000000||What happened, dammit, is that I fell and cracked me damn leg in two!
    377369|00000000||Stop whinin', Petter, I'm ashamed to hear it. Pull yourself together, man.
    461030|00000000||Worst case, Henrik'll whittle ye a wooden leg. Old Olle's got one and ye don't hear him complainin'.
    461079|00000000||Old Olle's also got lice, stinks and leaks out both ends, yet he don't complain 'bout that either. You two gonna help or no?
   1050125|00000000||How'd you fall?
    393516|00000000||How'd you fall?
    393518|00000000||We set out to light a fire there, atop the statue's shoulders. For our own glory and that of our ancestors.
    393520|00000000||Looks like you succeeded.
    393522|00000000||Aye, but the fire whoomped big so quick Petter jumped back, lost his balance…
    393524|00000000||Got lucky anyway. Could've broken his neck falling from that height.
    393512|00000000||How'd you fall?
    393514|00000000||You'll do fine without me.
   1049805|00000000||Farewell.
    393542|00000000||Need a medic or a druid, not a witcher. Farewell.
    393532|00000000||Nothing I can do to help.
    393538|00000000||Love to help, but a medic's what you need.
    393540|00000000||Tough… I'll get him to the village somehow, find a druid.
    393963|00000000||A druid? No chance! I don't trust any man who ploughin' lives on roots and leaves!
    393965|00000000||You'll have to make an exception or ye really will lose that leg.
   1049956|00000000||Common herb, you shouldn't have to look far. I don't have time.
   1050069|00000000||Oh, right, forgot, a man in need can only rely on hisself.
   1049804|00000000||Don't have time.
   1049800|00000000||Celandine would dull the pain.
   1049802|00000000||Know where it grows? I'd go meself, but I'm unwillin' to leave Petter alone.
   1049792|00000000||Celandine will help.
    461032|00000000||Statue - what's it all about?
    461146|00000000||This statue - what is it?
    461149|00000000||An altar to the god of warriors.
    461151|00000000||Any man who dares climb it and light the fire gains the favor of the gods, fame and--
    461162|00000000||And an excellent chance of snappin' his leg off at the arse.
    461234|00000000||You lot gonna help me or continue preachin'?
   1050089|00000000||How do you feel?
   1049807|00000000||Same as before. Owww!
    513507|00000000||Hey, let me out! Quick!
    513511|00000000||Don't even! No closer! He's mine!
    513535|00000000||Careful, you'll wake him!
    335378|05e21ea5||Guard
   1087888|6e7dfb65||Carlo the Captain
    553370|00000000||Well, well.
    552884|00000000||Listen! Er-ermion himself f-feared to en-enter the c-cursed wood!
    552886|00000000||Heard it already at the tavern.
    552888|00000000||You truly wish to settle on Spikeroog? P-p-permanently?
    552890|00000000||Wh-where'd you get that idea?
    553372|00000000||G-g-g-good day.
    553374|00000000||Nice to s-s-see you.
    553376|00000000||Master?
    553386|00000000||Hm?
    553378|00000000||A hundred sea devils!
    553388|00000000||Gwynbleidd?
    553380|00000000||Ah-ah. S-s-sorry.
    553382|00000000||B-b-b-but why so jumpy?
    553384|00000000||Freya!
    346154|00000000||Dim-witted bugger! Thicker than I thought. This time you'll not make it out alive!
   1069098|00000000||Look! It's him!
    560641|00000000||Grab a horse. We'll chase him down.
   1022335|00000000||Ye heard? Lonelyboy Svan's won another race! Even though his horse threw a shoe half way in!
   1022336|00000000||He'd finish first were he to ride a hobbled goat. Backwards!
    569128|00000000||Knew there'd be trouble. It was all too calm.
   1070360|00000000||Funny. Arnvald said the same. For a feast to be any good, mead's gotta flow, but so does blood.
   1070362|00000000||Might say he got his wish.
   1022759|00000000||Oh, that lighthouse puts me in a right fury… If only it were somethin' different - a troll, a chort, a griffin even!
   1049890|00000000||We'd call together some lads, grab our swords and cut the beast to pieces!
   1022765|00000000||But how're we to fight a wraith? No steel will wound it. No armor will protect ye from it!
   1049893|00000000||They say it takes silver to defeat a ghost… that or magic.
   1023227|00000000||That pain is normal. You're sixty years old, Oyvind. It's time you took it easier.
   1023229|00000000||Would ye have me lie down in me grave? Stop fartin' out your mouth, Roald, and give me somethin' for me back.
    577828|00000000||You did well.
    583663|00000000||Thought you'd be sulkin'.
    583665|00000000||Why would I? Showed 'em that even the lasses of Clan an Craite are fit to take the throne.
    583667|00000000||But I beat you.
    583669|00000000||If it had to be so, I'm glad it were you and not someone else.
    577829|00000000||You're an idiot as a brother, but you'll make a good king…
    583691|00000000||I will.
    583693|00000000||And I'm countin' on you bein' at my side when we set out against Nilfgaard.
    583695|00000000||Won't you feel silly? Goin' into battle arm in arm with a woman?
    583697|00000000||With my sis, of clan an Craite. Bravest lass the Isles ever made.
    585379|00000000||We can go. Is it far?
    585380|00000000||Nah, a stone's throw. Let's gather the lads and go in. We'll know soon if there's truth to the legends!
    585377|00000000||We can go.
   1001537|00000000||So, will you finally say why you've come?
    585339|00000000||Know the last time I had a Continental on me ship?
    585340|00000000||No.
    585341|00000000||When I hauled prisoners from Velen to the slave market in Nazair.
    594077|00000000||Now tell me why you're here.
    585343|00000000||Want to hire a witcher?
    585349|00000000||Any chance you got work for a witcher?
    585350|00000000||Any chance you want to swim to Spikeroog? Hey, lads! Strip 'im bare, toss 'im overboard!
    585351|00000000||Wait. Heard you're headed for the Cave of Dreams. Sure you can't use another sword or two?
    585352|00000000||Give us a dozen griffins and a mass o' wyverns - me and the lads'll--
    594164|00000000||You and your lads don't know a lick about monsters. Griffins and wyverns never share a habitat.
    594165|00000000||Well. Maybe y'are worth a few silver… Fine, I'll take you with.
    585373|00000000||I was about to go. You ready?
    585345|00000000||Your father felt you could use a witcher's help, and I owe him a favor, so…
    585346|00000000||Told him not to meddle. Told him I'd manage fine on me own.
    585347|00000000||Maybe that's not entirely true. Cave of Dreams - supposed to be a dangerous place.
    585348|00000000||Mortally so. But that's my reason for goin' there.
    594163|00000000||Fine, so be it, I'll take ye… Old man's like to throw a fit elsewise.
    585342|00000000||Your father sent me.
   1001536|00000000||Farewell.
   1001538|00000000||Never mind. So long.
    585381|00000000||Gimme a minute.
    585378|00000000||Gimme a minute.
    594166|00000000||What's in the Cave of Dreams?
    594210|00000000||What awaits us in the Cave of Dreams?
    594212|00000000||Depends wholly on us, 'cause… Argh, I'll explain later.
    585372|00000000||Well? Can we go?
   1048798|00000000||A son of An Skellig has passed the trial today.
   1048800|00000000||Raise your cups, raise your swords!
   1048802|00000000||He's worthy to wield a blade, to bring glory to his name!
   1048804|00000000||Raise your cups, raise your swords!
   1048806|00000000||A son of An Skellig has passed the trial today.
   1048808|00000000||Raise your cups, raise your swords!
   1048810|00000000||Fate will not burden his life with shame!
   1048812|00000000||Raise your cups, raise your swords!
   1048814|00000000||A cup for those who the trial broke today.
   1048816|00000000||One cup. Then may their memory fade into oblivion.
   1048818|00000000||Værthu Hemdall hael.
    315326|002eee28||Dagr
    393385|00000000||Killed 'em in cold blood…
    393387|00000000||Tis a crime. The gods will punish us!
    393686|00000000||Sven must be banished before the jarl learns of this.
    393688|00000000||Can you think of anyone brave enough to face Sven? I can't.
    462227|00000000||Clan Brokvar's emblem.
   1049710|00000000||Crate doesn't look at all like it was smashed in a storm. Someone chopped it open with an axe.
    440631|00000000||Some of the cargo's intact. Could be an owner waiting for news of its wherabouts. A grateful owner willing to pay a finder's fee.
    344980|00000000||Could be someone's entire fortune here. Lost, almost.
    348579|00000000||Will you help a man in need?
   1024578|00000000||Have ye heard? Arne's gatherin' men for a raid.
   1024580|00000000||I sure ain't gonna sail with 'im.
   1024582|00000000||What? Fear got you puckered?
   1024584|00000000||Say that one more time, and eels'll be eatin' your eyes afore the sun sets.
   1024586|00000000||Last time Arne claimed we'd plunder the Black Ones, but led us against Undvik, instead.
   1024590|00000000||All for some wench… He captured her, but lost half his men as well. Fuck that kinda raid.
   1070177|00000000||Word is you were ambushed. Tell me where?
   1070179|00000000||Short way from here, 'long the road to Lofoten. Saw a wagon cross-wise the road near the woods.
   1070181|00000000||We'd barely got to it when somethin' came rushin' through the underbrush and whoosh! Blood spurted in me eyes. I wiped it away, looked, saw Einar lyin' dead.
   1070173|00000000||Where'd it attack you?
   1070172|00000000||What'd the beast look like?
   1044243|00000000||Remember what the monster looked like?
   1044245|00000000||It were dark. Kaspar thought he saw somethin', but--
   1044257|00000000||Cause I did!
   1029814|00000000||It was huge, its maw all blood-smeared! Bugger gutted Ungi with one claw, near spliced 'im in two.
   1029815|00000000||Hm, interesting. Thanks.
   1029819|00000000||Huh? For what?
   1070169|00000000||Willing to talk about it? Tell me what happened?
   1070171|00000000||Ask away.
   1070158|00000000||Tell me what happened.
   1070157|00000000||Time I was on my way.
   1070155|00000000||Farewell.
   1029799|00000000||Really thought you could take on a monster?
   1044247|00000000||Really thought you could take on this monster? On your own?
   1044249|00000000||We had to try. If we didn't, who would?
   1044256|00000000||Think Larvik's some kind o' getaway for mutants, witchers stoppin' in every week?
   1029776|00000000||Oh, ask this witcher! He'll tell you monsters don't set traps.
   1029778|00000000||What's the issue?
   1029779|00000000||Ye or anyone ever heard of a beast settin' a wagon in the road, then waitin' in ambush? They're too ploughin' dumb for that, dammit!
   1029781|00000000||Dumb or no, they tore a few of our lads to shreds. And we ran like rats… They deserve to be buried…
   1070144|00000000||Still here, witcher? Cut the beast down, have ye?
   1071432|00000000||Need to know more, first. Word is you're the only ones who've seen it and lived to tell.
   1073593|00000000||How're you faring?
   1073595|00000000||All's well as can be thanks in no small part to you.
   1073702|00000000||I'm grateful.
   1073704|00000000||Greetings.
   1073706|00000000||Greetin's.
   1073596|00000000||Herbs - got any on offer?
   1073600|00000000||Mind if I have a look at your herbs?
   1073598|00000000||Farewell.
   1073606|00000000||See you.
   1073608|00000000||Fare thee well.
    422727|00000000||Why does the goddess bring you here?
    422729|00000000||Brought myself here, seems to me.
    422731|00000000||You do not worship Freya.
    422733|00000000||No. But I respect those that do. Including her priestesses.
    422735|00000000||This does you credit, but is meaningless as well. For Freya rewards and punishes those of other faiths and infidels as she does her own. Worship her and it will help, though it will settle nothing.
    437650|00000000||What do you need?
    422739|00000000||Mind if I have a look at your wares?
    422715|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    422745|00000000||Farewell.
    422719|00000000||Farewell.
    422717|00000000||Tell me about this temple.
    422741|00000000||Tell me something about this temple, could you?
    422743|00000000||It happened once that Freya lost her favorite white cat. She scoured the isles and finally found him here.
    437660|00000000||Freya's heart filled with joy and she blessed this place. A temple was then established here.
    437662|00000000||Didn't know Freya was into cats.
    437664|00000000||Your ignorance speaks poorly of you. The white cat is the goddess' sacred animal and has deep symbolic significance.
    437678|00000000||This temple is for those who seek Freya's help in finding what they desperately seek. Perhaps even you shall experience her grace.
    437700|00000000||Scorn her not! Or have you friends so powerful that you can afford to spurn divine aid?
    422737|00000000||Welcome to the Temple of Freya.
    574733|00000000||Who dares join Bald Sigge and Aegir Fishbreath in the Heroes' Pursuit?
    574735|00000000||Ye can do it, Aegir! Bolt off the mark and never look back!
    574736|00000000||Cut your horse's hide, that'll get its hooves movin'!
    574738|00000000||Horses're antsy… All of you ready?
    574741|00000000||They're off! Faster, faster!
    574745|00000000||That all you got?! Can't ye go any faster?!
    574743|00000000||Hahaha!
    574747|00000000||I won! I won!
    574749|00000000||Who won?! Huh?! Who?! Bald Sigge, that's who!
    559040|93b7fe8c||Clue
    391179|00000000||Hold up, traveler! Wait!
    163900|00000000||What're you sniffin' at?
    163904|00000000||Me old lady claims I smell of the barn.
    163906|00000000||I don't smell nothin'.
    163908|00000000||Exactly! I knew it - she made the whole thing up!
   1050039|00000000||Wenches, you know… But enough talkin', grab a fork. We've got manure to haul.
    163782|00000000||Tell me, Bjorn, what do ye really want from life?
    163784|00000000||Me? From life? I just want some peace and quiet.
    163834|00000000||Don't tell me that vixen of yours is givin' you a hard time.
    163836|00000000||Hilda? No, not her. But her mother's over from Hindarsfjal…
   1046514|00000000||We've got to get this wood to the jarl. He'll be furious elsewise…
   1046516|00000000||And what'll he do to us?
   1046518|00000000||I dunno… But when Bosse was late with the tar, the jarl himself rode up to see what was the matter. Pushed Bosse in the vat.
   1046534|00000000||All right… I'll catch me breath a bit longer. Then we'll get back to work.
    393244|00000000||Either open up, or prepare to lose your stones.
    393246|00000000||I say we set fire to the shack!
    393248|00000000||Argh, loot'd burn up with it, and there's more than junk inside.
    542708|00000000||I wanna fight.
    542710|00000000||Grand! Tell me when you're ready.
    521045|00000000||Greetings.
    521046|00000000||Heard of you. People! Look who's come to fight!
    542705|00000000||That is why you're here, right?
    521107|00000000||Ready to fight right now.
    521108|00000000||Done well so far. Hope your luck continues against Olaf.
    521109|00000000||Ready to fight anytime, even now.
    521131|00000000||Like to have some words with the outlander, first.
    521156|00000000||It's about my Eryka. See her? I… I gotta win today. She's watchin'.
    521158|00000000||I don't stand a chance against ye, I know it well. But I was thinkin' - maybe you'd let me win?
    521200|00000000||Listen, if I lose on purpose, we'll both regret it, believe me.
    521201|00000000||But it's Eryka we're talkin' about! You don't understand a thing.
    521160|00000000||Not about to throw the fight.
    521159|00000000||Fine. Let you win, but just once.
    521161|00000000||All right. We'll do it like this: first fight, I'll take a dive. But then we'll go at it again… best man wins.
    521202|00000000||Enough of this chatter! Fight!
    542776|00000000||Let's start.
    542778|00000000||Well, then! Fight!
    521047|00000000||I'm ready.
    521090|00000000||Might fight some other time. See you.
    521049|00000000||Farewell.
    521048|00000000||What's this tournament like?
    521086|00000000||Tournament rules, what are they?
    521087|00000000||The fighters are both upstarts seekin' to prove their grit and brawn and courage, and old hands just lookin' to keep the rust at bay.
    542744|00000000||Ye get similar bouts in Novigrad and Velen, but those're glorified tavern brawls, ye ask me. This here's a minor festival.
    542808|00000000||Thinking of trying my hand…
    542810|00000000||Soon as you're ready, come forth and speak up.
   1029419|00000000||You - you're a witcher? I seein' right?
   1011856|00000000||Greetings. Saw your notice.
   1029417|00000000||Hah! And they said, "Why you hangin' that? Ain't no one else gonna hunt that beast." But I showed 'em.
   1011857|00000000||Yes. Got work for me?
   1029485|00000000||If you're willin'… Some manner o' evil prowls about, got us scared to venture outta the village.
   1044955|00000000||Killed the beast that was troubling you.
   1029707|00000000||Merciful Freya, Whoreson's finally dead. Ptooey! Now, tell us - was it a tough fight? Got any wounds need dressin'?
   1013830|00000000||No, I'll be all right.
   1013832|00000000||Ahh, nothin' new to the likes of you. Hard work, witcherin'. Ah right, your reward… This here's for you.
   1029713|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1069959|00000000||Job's done.
   1029566|00000000||The four survivors - where'll I find them?
   1029624|00000000||Aim to talk to Sverre? Maybe 'tain't a bad idea. They're sittin' over there, by that hut.
   1014194|00000000||I'll tend to the monster.
   1029565|00000000||Not your first, that's clear enough. Not like our lads… heads full o' fire but not a morsel o' thought 'tween 'em.
   1014192|00000000||I'll tend to the monster.
   1069968|00000000||Hmph! That's what ye'd ask for a golden dragon, maybe! No chance!
   1069970|00000000||Ye knows how to bargain, grant you that. Drop it a bit more, we'll have deal.
   1069972|00000000||Argh, have it your way. 'Tis your neck on the line.
   1069974|00000000||Gods've taken all reason from ye! Ye can take the offer or sod off!
   1045480|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1071400|00000000||Ye want to bargain? How would ye count it? Height in hands at the withers, or--
   1071402|00000000||Mm-mm. By species. Drowner's less than a cockatrice.
   1071404|00000000||Ah-hah! But we've no notion what prowls the high road! Whaddaya say ye cut it down, and then we'll talk…?
   1071406|00000000||Mm-mm. We pre-agree a price, define a bonus for unforeseen risks.
   1071408|00000000||Errr… so, how much?
   1045461|00000000||Let's talk reward.
   1014193|00000000||Farewell.
   1014195|00000000||So long.
   1069960|00000000||Farewell.
   1069958|00000000||What kind of beast are we talking about?
   1069998|00000000||Any idea what kind of beast this is?
   1070000|00000000||Aw, ye hear all sorts o' things. The wenches clean the nets blather about koshcheys and manticores. But I reckon that's hogwash.
   1071410|00000000||We'd seek the council o' Freya's priestesses, we would. But how can we when we can't get to the shrine?
   1071412|00000000||And nobody's gotten a glimpse of the beast? From a distance, even?
   1071414|00000000||Oh, they have, they have - right close, closer'n boot and strap. Soon after their blood spattered the underbrush.
   1029440|00000000||Knew from the start no ordinary man could handle the beast. But Sverre insisted, mustered a crew and…
   1007669|00000000||Only four came back. The rest massacred, east of the village. So, will ye help?
   1029568|00000000||So will ye help, then?
   1046030|00000000||Oh, that 'un would make quick work o' the beast!
   1045263|00000000||Greetings.
    166171|00000000||Do you have no shame?
    171653|00000000||Shame…? Why would I?
    171655|00000000||A queen should join her king on his last journey. Tradition demands it.
    420379|00000000||Holger… To your health, especially that black hand!
    420362|00000000||Come, Geralt.
    420364|00000000||Stay and chew the fat with us, Geralt.
    420381|00000000||We were supposed to move on.
    420389|00000000||Let your woman roam alone. You stay here, we'll have another drink.
    373558|00000000||I shouldn't drink.
    373568|00000000||Bran - a great king, a great man.
    373570|00000000||May our next king be his equal.
    373572|00000000||Geralt?
    524206|00000000||All right. Let's go.
    420391|00000000||We should go.
    420383|00000000||Now I've a toast. May the emperor of Nilfgaard's prick stay as soft as a noodle, so there'll be no foul spawn to take his place on the throne!
    373560|00000000||To Bran.
    373556|00000000||To Bran.
    373554|00000000||Birna's a scheming whore. Refuses to admit her reign's ended.
    524205|00000000||Bran knew how to keep her in line. Let's drink to his memory.
    376300|00000000||Let's move on, Yen.
    434922|00000000||High time we did as well. Come, Svanrige.
    376282|00000000||We should move on.
    376278|00000000||I'm sorry for your loss.
    376288|00000000||Heard a lot of good things about Bran.
    434912|00000000||I will miss him sorely.
    434916|00000000||I was not his first wife, but I bore him his first-born son and saw him off on his final journey.
    524208|00000000||We lived a great many years together.
    387280|00000000||Yen's right.
    387290|00000000||A custom that demands widows burn themselves alive - too harsh.
    387292|00000000||Foreigners.
    387296|00000000||Holger, perhaps you'd like to show us the meaning of courage, walk willingly into flames. I'm sure we can scrape together some wood.
    387298|00000000||Callin' me a coward?!
    387300|00000000||Calm yourself, Holger. You speak to a widow at her husband's wake.
    387282|00000000||Not our place to criticize, Yen. All peoples do things their own way.
    387284|00000000||We're talking about the self-immolation of women, not about decorating trees for Yule.
    387286|00000000||Harsh custom, but this is a harsh land. Tradition is Skellige's backbone.
    387288|00000000||People make laws, and people can change them.
    387278|00000000||Not our place to get involved.
    376270|00000000||Geralt, this is Holger Blackhand. Birna, Bran's widow and our hostess today, you've already met.
    387272|00000000||Widow? A widow's duty is to lie beside her husband.
    376272|00000000||A widow's duty is to care for the king's son.
    387274|00000000||Not by our customs it ain't.
    387276|00000000||Your customs are barbarous.
   1022201|00000000||Yana… It'll be three weeks since the storm now. You've naught to look out for. He's not comin' back.
   1022203|00000000||You don't know that. Maybe his rudder broke, he was set adrift. Maybe sirens saved him. We've both heard the stories.
   1022205|00000000||Tales, Yana. They're naught but fairytales.
   1022207|00000000||If the sea'd only give back his body. I've sewed him a lovely shirt. He'd be dressed fine as a jarl for the funeral…
    546154|00000000||Greetings.
    524194|00000000||If you've been named champion of Velen already, try your luck in Novigrad.
    524195|00000000||If you've bested all in Novigrad, try your luck in Velen.
    524196|00000000||Once you're all done, sail to Spikeroog. It's there you'll fight to be Champion of Champions.
    524182|00000000||Farewell.
    524183|00000000||Fought enough today. See you.
   1047193|00000000||You've defeated everyone there was to defeat in Skellige. Makes you Champion of the Isles. Take pride, friend.
    524192|00000000||Anyone else out there I could fight?
    524181|00000000||What now?
    524179|00000000||You defeated Olaf, 'twas a fair fight.
    524193|00000000||Isles're home to many a brave lad you'd find it hard to best. If you've not defeated 'em all, seek 'em out and challenge 'em.
   1020836|00000000||But I… Mhm. I understand.
   1020834|00000000||I made a mistake. I know this now. Swear by Freya and all the gods - never again!
   1017165|00000000||Best keep that promise. I ever hear of another ship, even a dinghy, running aground off Eldberg… I'll come back here, finish what the penitent started. Understand?
   1017163|00000000||Let it slide. This time.
   1017164|00000000||You gotta leave.
   1017168|00000000||Absolutely, never. Soon as we're done talking, you're gonna pack up and leave. For good. Understand?
   1017171|00000000||I'd gladly thank you with words and gold. It's just my coin pouch is empty.
   1017172|00000000||I know the feeling. So long.
   1020829|00000000||It did. Still don't know what brought the penitent here, though… You'd best be careful.
   1020831|00000000||It did. But that doesn't make the island safe… 'Cause you're still here. A light keeper who lures ships onto the rocks… Sheesh.
   1017162|00000000||D-did it work?
    168949|00000000||A whale.
    168961|00000000||Answer's a whale.
    168898|00000000||Bad! It troll! Whale no step, idgit! Him in pot!
    168900|00000000||Hang on a minute. It's my turn.
    168951|00000000||A troll.
    168963|00000000||A troll, of course.
    169012|00000000||Grr... Good, troll. Now you asks.
    169000|00000000||The answer is "your breath." All right, your turn. But make it quick or my guy'll boil to a pulp.
    415235|00000000||Hurry up, dammit!
    168945|00000000||Cold and splashes... Umm, a rhyme, rhyme… "Cold and splashes, wave crashes."
    168890|00000000||Snow.
    168896|00000000||Snow?
    169004|00000000||Bad!
    169006|00000000||In that case…
    169008|00000000||Soup break!
    169010|00000000||Dammit.
    170946|00000000||That took too long.
    168894|00000000||A corpse.
    168886|00000000||A corpse.
    168953|00000000||Changed my mind, no time for riddles.
    158125|00000000||Had enough!
    168884|00000000||Forget it. Just don't feel like negotiating.
    168965|00000000||I don't have time for riddles.
    168967|00000000||You in pot!
    168892|00000000||I don't wanna guess anymore.
    168888|00000000||A rock.
    163504|00000000||A rock.
    309649|00000000||Grrr... Stupid riddle.
    312440|00000000||Feather, troll not hold, not piss…
    169002|00000000||I won fair and square.
    309647|00000000||Riddle hard! Human cheat!
    163508|00000000||"I'm light as a feather, but even a troll can't hold me for long."
    163510|00000000||Eee... Err...
    163512|00000000||Hmmm…
    163514|00000000||Eee…
    163516|00000000||Piss?
    168959|00000000||It's a clock.
    392983|00000000||Clock? This what…? Bad! To pot!
    392993|00000000||Hang on. It's my turn.
    168947|00000000||A clock.
    163498|00000000||Play me for the man, then. If I win, I take him with me. If I lose, I'll jump in the pot too.
    163500|00000000||Good, good! Hehehe.
    415292|00000000||What?! Ploughin' riddles? Now?!
    415294|00000000||No bubble!
    163502|00000000||First riddle: "Lots eats, lots drinks."
    171024|00000000||"Big he be, steps big he, big he bash."
    158123|00000000||All right, let's play for him - you and me.
    158121|00000000||Cookin' somethin'?
    158174|00000000||Aye, cooking.
    158176|00000000||Hey! You there! Help me! Water's getting' hot! Ah! Argh!
    168876|00000000||Shut it!
    168878|00000000||I need that man.
    168880|00000000||No! We win human from Myrhyff!
    168882|00000000||I figure riddle.
   1043508|00000000||Fuckin' hell, didn't hurt this much when that bear clawed me shoulder.
   1043509|00000000||Stop groanin', herb'll do its thing soon, and I'll take ye to the druid.
    485928|00000000||I'm ready.
    485929|00000000||All right. I'll be back soon.
   1064481|00000000||In the meantime, get a fire goin' in the oven.
    485926|00000000||Let's start.
    485931|00000000||I don't know what you have in store for me. Gotta prepare, at least a little.
    485932|00000000||All right. Let me know when you're ready.
    485927|00000000||No, I need to get ready.
    488734|00000000||So? Can we start?
    485924|00000000||Hope you know what you're doing…
    485925|00000000||So do I…
    485922|00000000||I trust you.
    485939|00000000||No reason to wait.
    485937|00000000||Let's go now.
    485940|00000000||Wanna look around some more. Meet you there.
    485938|00000000||I'll join you later.
    488739|00000000||You're asking me to put my life at risk, Udalryk's life at risk. I can't do that.
    488741|00000000||I prefer witchers' methods - tried and true.
    488744|00000000||I see. If something were to go wrong, it’s true… So be it. Let's get Udalryk.
    488746|00000000||But you'll have to tell him what this witchers' method's about.
    485923|00000000||No way.
    488708|00000000||Come up with anything?
    488722|00000000||Yes, I've a plan - one that just might work.
    488724|00000000||Can I get any details?
    488728|00000000||You've got to wait for me here. I won't be long.
    495335|00000000||Uhhh, anything else…?
    495337|00000000||Said yourself - you can't know the details. So no, nothing else. You simply gotta trust me.
    390026|00000000||Arnulf is dead!
    391411|00000000||What?!
    390028|00000000||Your brother, he's been murdered! Dammit, c'mon people, we gotta take him down!
   1010305|00000000||Hmm, strange… Knife protruding from that one's gut… No sign of fighting, otherwise…
   1010315|00000000||Skelligan honor… Chose to die instead of living with the knowledge they'd let down their brother…
   1010318|00000000||God-fearing warriors…
   1010317|00000000||Brothers entrusted themselves to the goddess before they died.
   1010316|00000000||Freya's symbol… scrawled in blood…
    560061|00000000||Trapdoor under a bearskin rug… Classic.
    587468|00000000||C'mon. Open it.
   1022389|00000000||Einar's back from a raid. They say when he lost his axe, he went to smashin' Nilfgaardians with his bare hands.
   1022391|00000000||Ehh, I know he's unequaled in a fistfight… But I think that's vergin' on eyewash.
   1022393|00000000||Naye. He showed us the plates he took off the Black Ones. They all had dents - shaped by his fists.
   1022395|00000000||Did you hear? Some outlander thrashed Einar. Man couldn't stand up straight for three days after.
   1022397|00000000||Well, well. What's next? Some vagrant from the Continent gonna out drink Madman Lugos? It's end-times for sure!
   1042573|00000000||We must go to the central chamber, try to power down the security measures.
   1042575|00000000||The Defensive Regulatory Magicon could react. Be on your guard.
   1050112|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! Our hero!
   1024272|00000000||Thick, leathery leaves… rough to the touch.
   1024274|00000000||An ill omen. It'll be a dry year.
   1024276|00000000||At least there's no sign of woodworm. When you hear their scratching, it means hail for sure.
    485901|00000000||But why? Why'd you do it?!
    485902|00000000||I… I had to. The gods commanded it.
    485903|00000000||No gods command men to do such things!
    492027|00000000||J-o-n-n-a… May it be quick and painless.
    413288|00000000||So I jumped on his back, sank my blade in his neck to the hilt!
    414757|00000000||Blood sprayed out like a true geyser, 'cept cold as a mountain stream!
    414759|00000000||But so many of your mates died. A shame, that.
    414761|00000000||Aye, damn shame. But bewailin' 'em's for naught. We'd do better to drink to their memory!
   1070507|00000000||Here's his room. Arnvald slept there, by the wall.
   1072796|00000000||Clothes all over the place. Think Arnvald might've been in a hurry.
   1073271|00000000||And a lone shoe. Unlike him - he paid attention to how he looked.
   1073229|00000000||Shoes are of a pair.
   1072798|00000000||Wonder where the other one is.
   1073273|00000000||Think that important?
   1073275|00000000||Was wearing both on the beach. Remember that clearly 'cause he didn't have much else on. Now where could it be?
   1072800|00000000||Got a shoe under the table.
   1072802|00000000||Arnvald must've kicked it in his rush to get away.
   1072804|00000000||Hm… Something inside it.
   1072806|00000000||Beautiful things… all pretty much useless to us.
   1072808|00000000||We should take everythin' anyway. Never know what could be important.
   1072810|00000000||Right.
   1073287|00000000||"The Song of Bran the Conqueror."
   1073289|00000000||Bran the Conqueror's a hero to Clan Tuirseach. He took Skellige's crown by force, was killed soon after.
   1073291|00000000||Interesting, but it's hardly proof.
    560928|00000000||An empty envelope. Hm… scent's familiar…
   1073277|00000000||Must say I envy you that.
   1073279|00000000||Ambergris… Means a user of perfume. That's the scent to follow.
   1073334|00000000||Birna Bran… Horrific death.
    392904|00000000||Wanted to see what you have on offer.
    392856|00000000||Can't charge you for lookin'. Peruse at will.
    392850|00000000||Show me what you have in stock?
   1086472|00000000||Wouldn't mind playing cards. You game?
    392922|00000000||See you.
    392854|00000000||Farewell.
    392852|00000000||Kaer Trolde's preparing for war?
    392858|00000000||Harbor's real busy. Looks like Crach's marshaling his forces for war.
    392868|00000000||If that weren't old gossip, I'd take you for a spy. But I know you're a friend of Crach, so I'm proud to say you're right.
    392906|00000000||Come summer we'll have three new longboats: the "Hemdall," the "Kambi," and the "Wild Boar of the Sea." The last for Crach himself.
    393682|00000000||Your clan planning to take up arms against Nilfgaard?
    393684|00000000||We'll see what our new king says. But it'd be strange to see those longships just sit in the harbor.
    392848|00000000||Greetings.
    392898|00000000||And a most humble greeting to you, sir. Name's Karl, but Whistling Whacker they call me.
    393676|00000000||Interesting as monikers go.
    393678|00000000||When I was a lad, my pa told me, "Son, you'll be a merchant one day. If you want folk to buy from you, you gotta draw them in."
    393680|00000000||"You're neither pretty nor smart nor much of a sweet-talker, so I hereby name you Whistlin' Whacker. People'll come by just to ask you what that means. Don't blow those opportunities."
   1007900|00000000||Something's here. Another wreck.
   1007926|00000000||Let's see if our djinn's down there.
    581195|00000000||How's it going?
    581196|00000000||Yen, you know I hate it when you read my mind.
   1006772|00000000||Strictly speaking, I'm not reading your mind, but using telepathy.
   1006774|00000000||Besides, you've nothing to hide, right?
   1006776|00000000||Wouldn't admit it if I did. Not the point.
   1006778|00000000||See anything interesting?
    581201|00000000||A shipwreck and a cavern. I'll look inside.
    592612|00000000||It's too deep here. You can't dive that long.
    592613|00000000||You underestimate me.
    592614|00000000||On the contrary. After all, I asked you for help.
   1008094|00000000||I'll cast a spell. It will slow your heart for a time, you can stay submerged longer.
    581187|00000000||There's something here… On the bottom.
   1006948|00000000||You're getting better at this.
   1006949|00000000||Go even quicker if you helped me down there.
   1008033|00000000||I prefer to observe matters from up here, most definitely.
   1017442|00000000||Yeah, like when we were looking for the golden dragon and an avalanche swept us off the trail?
   1017443|00000000||Me clinging to the remains of a bridge for dear life, you gripping my waist, admiring the view. Remember?
   1017480|00000000||Chasm below us was breathtaking - rustling trees, a lazily flowing stream…
   1017444|00000000||I remember… Though I found myself admiring what I had right in front of me.
   1005717|00000000||Get rid of them!
    581332|00000000||Jump in, see for yourself.
    581333|00000000||Sea water wreaks havoc on my complexion.
   1006797|00000000||Just find the wreck.
    581331|00000000||How's your bath? Water warm enough for you?
   1007919|00000000||Ugh. Gotta deal with the sirens first.
   1007927|00000000||Hit and sunk.
   1008026|00000000||Here's hoping you're just as good at searching sunken ships.
   1017544|00000000||Esad eich crydae rhythaun!
   1074418|00000000||Say we find the djinn, what'll you do?
   1074490|00000000||Ask for a beautiful house, then a palace, then a queen's crown?
   1074420|00000000||Are we still talking about the djinn, or have we moved on to a talking fish?
   1074422|00000000||Doesn't much matter. Both make wishes come true.
   1074492|00000000||What would yours be?
   1074424|00000000||You'll learn in due course.
    592615|00000000||Ready. Careful down there.
   1005814|00000000||Don't you dare disembark before disposing of every last siren.
   1005850|00000000||Last one.
   1006756|00000000||Time to check the bottom.
    581063|00000000||Not sure this djinn thing's a good idea.
   1006715|00000000||We managed to seize one before. Do you remember?
   1006717|00000000||Course. Dandelion almost lost his voice that time.
    581064|00000000||Haha. How lucky your 'exorcism' saved it. It was poetic.
   1013869|00000000||Yeah, how was I supposed to know that incantation meant "Begone and plough yourself?"
   1013871|00000000||You should've studied foreign languages.
   1013873|00000000||Gonna keep bringing that up for the rest of my life?
   1013875|00000000||Of course. Your last wish effectively assured it.
   1008019|00000000||My wish was about us being together always, not about you mocking my every mistake.
   1017262|00000000||"Careful what you wish for." And when your wish is granted, you must accept it with all attendant circumstances.
   1017265|00000000||Yeah…
   1017259|00000000||And as for your missteps - I don't rightly see why I shouldn't laugh if they're amusing.
   1017541|00000000||Where to now?
   1017542|00000000||Wherever the leads take us.
   1006787|00000000||Find anything?
    581328|00000000||Snapped masts, busted planks, and a whole swarm of drowners.
   1061373|00000000||Probably drawn by the corpses of drowned crew. Then made their nest here.
   1006791|00000000||There's also a Clan Drummond figurehead.
    581329|00000000||Not the right ship. Come back up.
    560950|00000000||They were waiting for him.
    560951|00000000||He probably thought they'd take him someplace safe.
    585727|00000000||I can't believe he could be so… so stupid! Oh, gods, I've known him all my life.
    560952|00000000||Need to search the body.
    521702|00000000||Will no one accept the challenge? C'mon! Don't be shy!
    521703|00000000||Looking's for pansies! Step in the ring, with the real men!
   1021497|00000000||Heard Nilfgaardians were bitin' yesterday 'stead o' the fish.
   1021499|00000000||Oh, aye. Hauled one in meself, saw 'im driftin' on a plank. Promised me a gold ring to put 'im ashore.
   1049761|00000000||So? D'ye take pity on the sodden wretch?
   1021501|00000000||Ye know ye can't refuse a castaway. Though… once we were on shore, I slit his throat.
    423608|d3f91a2c||Armorer
   1049114|00000000||Maybe he'll say something if I put out his fire…
   1049116|00000000||Tin pots… Stand to make a lot of noise… Maybe give 'em a smack once he's asleep…
   1049112|00000000||Hornets' nest… Known to have therapeutic uses. In shock therapy, for instance.
    408351|00000000||Already paid.
   1043319|00000000||You're confused. I already paid. Just here for the pick-up.
   1043321|00000000||Ah, aye, I remember now.
   1043303|00000000||That leaves transport. We brought 'em here, you gotta take 'em onward. Ye'd do best to sail your ship into the bay.
   1043305|00000000||Just give me the key to the cell.
   1043307|00000000||Then what? Will ye drive 'em on foot? Ye alone?
   1043309|00000000||Any who drop, I'll leave behind. Ville only wants the strong.
   1043311|00000000||Fine, here. Just don't come cryin' for your coin if they run. They're your property now.
   1043299|00000000||Yeah. Your coin.
   1043301|00000000||They call you Black Ones whoresons to a man, but me, I like doin' business with yous. At least you don't stall in payin'.
    408349|00000000||Here's your coin.
   1043491|00000000||You're right, Ville didn't send me.
   1043494|00000000||Sorry to disappoint. To be honest, I'm not from Nilfgaard. And I haven't the faintest who Ville is.
   1043496|00000000||Enemy in the camp! To arms!
    408359|00000000||I really don't like to hear humans reffered to as "goods." And I'm not a slave trader.
    408353|00000000||I'm not a slave trader.
    408329|00000000||What'd you expect - a big sun on my chest? Would that be Nilfgaardian enough for you?
   1043498|00000000||Fine, fine, no need to be jumpy. Goods're ready.
    408331|00000000||Don't like to hear humans referred to as "goods."
    408333|00000000||I don't give a fuck what ye do or don't like. Got the sum we agreed on?
   1043490|00000000||We doing this deal or not?
    408327|00000000||Heard you've been waiting for me. How're the goods?
   1047986|00000000||Had to calm a few of 'em, but we managed it without doin' serious harm. Tough islanders, these, they'll serve you well.
   1047989|00000000||Good. Ville doesn't like cock-ups.
   1043489|00000000||Hm… Sure it were Ville who sent you? Expected someone more… Nilfgaardian.
    421522|00000000||Hear that noise? That's Freya - grindin' her teeth, haha.
    500865|00000000||Means war's a-brewin'. Time to sharpen our swords.
    500867|00000000||With Bran dead, who will lead you?
    500869|00000000||Don't need a king to stick it to the Black Ones. No reason to wait.
    421926|00000000||Could you craft something for me?
    421924|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
   1086491|00000000||Take a break. Play a little gwent with me.
    421530|00000000||Farewell.
    421526|00000000||Farewell.
    421524|00000000||What do you have on offer?
    421528|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
    500871|00000000||You're back, White Hair.
