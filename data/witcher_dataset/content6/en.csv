   1047830|069826f1||Rock Troll
    515699|00000000||Shhh.
    515698|00000000||So, Yennefer found a volunteer to walk around with that chirping stick after all.
   1040320|00000000||Got the reward I promised you… Mahakaman spirit.
   1040322|00000000||Hah! Lambert claimed you'd forget. Thanks, brother.
   1040324|00000000||Did everything to deserve it. Well, Scorpion did. But I'm not about to ply your horse with vodka.
   1040308|00000000||Got your reward - Mahakaman spirit.
    459889|00000000||See you.
    335356|00000000||So long.
    335354|00000000||Any interesting contracts lately?
    459875|00000000||Happen on any interesting contracts lately?
    459877|00000000||Er, not lately. But about half a year back I slew a manticore in Creyden, in a forest. Quick son of a bitch, that one.
   1020887|00000000||Jumped out of the undergrowth so fast my medallion didn't have time to give me so much as one twitch. Won't show you the scar – too big a boy for that.
   1020894|00000000||Get a nice sum at least?
   1020904|00000000||Huh, not one copper. Showed the beast's head to the elder in the nearest village. He swore on all the gods it was the first he'd heard of the monster.
   1020911|00000000||What about you?
   1020912|00000000||Besides the griffin, same ol', same ol' – nekkers, ghouls, drowners… Haven't seen a manticore in… must be a year, now.
    459879|00000000||Eskel.
    459881|00000000||Hm?
    528719|00000000||Well, well… Lovebirds decided to join us. Enjoy yourselves?
    528721|00000000||You heard the answer to that question, Lambert… Besides, not our business.
    528717|00000000||So? Head Sorceress box your ears again?
    528777|00000000||You could say that.
    519808|00000000||Uh, Yen, we don't have glasses. You all right drinkin' from a mug?
    519810|00000000||I'd drink from an old boot tonight.
    524833|00000000||Urghgh… Perhaps instead of getting crocked in deep glum, we could do some catching up?
    524830|00000000||Where've you been, Lambert?
   1075416|00000000||What've you been up to, Lambert? Any interesting contracts before you set off in search of Karadin?
    446990|00000000||What've you been up to, Lambert? On your way west last time I saw you.
    447029|00000000||Uh, yeah. Contract in Lan Exeter. Not to boast, but a pretty lucrative one.
    447045|00000000||Yeah, Kovir's where the gold's to be made. Know how much they pay there for a drowner?
    519912|00000000||Shush, I'm talking now. So this giant was giving 'em trouble. Attacking convoys, dragging folk off into the swamps…
    519915|00000000||…and relieving himself on the highway, rendering it dreadfully slippery. You've built enough suspense, get to the point.
    519951|00000000||Fine. Turned out it wasn't a giant, just a fat forest troll. And a group of bandits were ambushing the convoys.
    519953|00000000||What did you do?
    519955|00000000||Killed the bandits to keep the roads safe. Then I killed the troll. Needed its, uh, head to collect the bounty.
    519959|00000000||Could've spared the troll…
    519961|00000000||Pff. To eat roots and sleep in roadside ditches? I needed the coin. And not a soul mourned that troll's passing.
    519963|00000000||Let's raise a mug to his memory - the least we can do.
    519957|00000000||Might've spared the troll.
    519956|00000000||Pragmatic, as ever.
    519965|00000000||Pragmatic as ever…
    519967|00000000||You could stand to show some of Lambert's expediency, set ideals like justice for trolls aside, keep yourself out of poverty instead.
    519969|00000000||Knew the sorceress would see it my way.
   1067898|00000000||Eskel, fess up. How'd you get that katakan?
   1067900|00000000||Eskel, that katakan we cut up together - tell us how you nabbed him.
   1067902|00000000||A katakan?
    446988|00000000||Eskel, care to share?
    447071|00000000||Where'd you go while you were away, Eskel?
    447073|00000000||Aldersberg. Hunted a higher vampire.
    447075|00000000||Oh-ho-ho… Dangerous whoresons, those.
    447077|00000000||Finicky, too. Specimen in question only went for young women from the upper classes.
    447079|00000000||That's like me.
    519972|00000000||We've no interest in your fantasies, Lambert. Whereas the vampire… even I'm curious to know how you managed.
    519974|00000000||My client threw a masquerade ball for the city's notables - to lure the vampire out of hiding. I was there, too, disguised. Lemme tell you, never had so much success with the ladies as I did that night.
    519978|00000000||Mixing work and romance? Bad idea. Vampire coulda caught you with your pants down.
    519980|00000000||Suppose so. But you look the way I do, you gotta grab every chance you can get.
    519982|00000000||Hahaha, maybe you should wear a mask permanently.
    519984|00000000||Huh! And maybe you should wear a gag.
    519976|00000000||Mixing business and pleasure? Bad idea.
    519975|00000000||Get the vampire?
    520014|00000000||What about the vampire?
    520016|00000000||I'd made a deal with this young alchemist. She really loaded up - fisstech, vodka, magic mushrooms. Went out into the garden, vampire found her and drank his fill. Fight was an afterthought.
    520018|00000000||Hm… A fairy tale on gluttony for modern times.
    520020|00000000||Alchemist come out of it all right?
    520022|00000000||Fine. Lost a bit of blood, I suppose. Hangover was the worst part. She drank nothing but pickle juice for the next month.
    446972|00000000||Well, I…
    447126|00000000||Eventful times for me, recently. Kings, dragons, conspiracies and, then, I found Yen.
    447184|00000000||We're thrilled for you. But why don't you tell us about Uma instead?
    447186|00000000||Pff. Long story. I was on Ciri's trail - went to Velen, Skellige, Novigrad - where Dandelion needed saving again.
    447194|00000000||He get caught ploughing somebody he shouldn't 'ave been?
    447196|00000000||Right. Speaking of old friends, Novigrad and ploughing… How's Triss?
    520579|00000000||We were talking about Uma, weren't we?
    520581|00000000||The night is young. Got time to talk about everything.
    520032|00000000||I was talking about Uma.
    520583|00000000||Triss is… managing all right.
    520585|00000000||How're those scars she got at Sodden? Still there?
    520033|00000000||Triss is managing.
    520031|00000000||Fuck off.
    520575|00000000||Fuck off, Lambert.
    520577|00000000||Whoa! Hit a sore spot, I guess.
    520587|00000000||Lambert. Not funny.
    520589|00000000||Fine. Conversation turned serious? Let's talk. Yen, what do you plan to do with Uma?
    520591|00000000||I said I'll tell you tomorrow.
    520593|00000000||So tell us now. It's after midnight.
    520595|00000000||I'll subject him to the Trial of Grasses. But only--
    520597|00000000||You'll fucking what?!
    520622|00000000||Mind your manners, Lambert.
    520624|00000000||Did you hear what--?
    520626|00000000||Not gonna ask you again.
    520614|00000000||Mind your manners.
    520615|00000000||[Don't react.]
    520628|00000000||Uh, sorry… looking to turn him into a witcher?
    520630|00000000||Of course not. As I was about to say, I'll only apply the first half of the Trial, because--
    520632|00000000||Because you wanna watch him suffer?
    520634|00000000||Stop interrupting, or I will watch you suffer.
    520650|00000000||To restore Uma's former appearance, we must first… Hmm… How do I explain it…
    520636|00000000||Imagine a lump of clay. In order to shape it, you must first moisten it or it will crumble. The Trial's initial part does just that. It opens the body to change, so to speak. Only then can the mutagens produce a witcher.
    529779|00000000||Don't stay up long. Tomorrow's an important day.
    520689|00000000||It'll be the first Trial in years… decades.
    520691|00000000||I knew you'd be wary.
    520693|00000000||Wary? That's not the problem. Those secrets have been forgotten. And that's how they should stay.
    520695|00000000||I'd be the last to suggest you start producing hordes of witchers.
    520697|00000000||You hardly need to. See, till now we had a great excuse not to take in apprentices. Seems we'll need to talk it over.
    520699|00000000||Maybe later. Who's up for another round?
    520700|00000000||Oh, I am. But we're all outta stuff to chew on. Geralt, mind raiding the kitchen?
    520711|00000000||Not at all.
    528774|00000000||Gentlemen, pleasure drinking with you… Lambert especially. But the hour is late.
    520686|00000000||It'll be the first Trial in years.
    520687|00000000||What're the chances Uma'll survive?
    520702|00000000||What are the chances Uma will survive?
    520704|00000000||Not great. But we've no choice.
    520706|00000000||Unless Vesemir can do the trick with his hemlock.
    520708|00000000||Might be surprised. Old man knows his stuff.
    530299|00000000||You got turned around, Wolf… Pond's the other direction.
    530300|00000000||Fine, Geralt, if you feel like wandering, do it on your own… Find me at the stables once you've gotten some air…
    530293|00000000||Huh… Think I'll stick to the boat.
    394356|00000000||Yen mention why she wants this?
    387079|00000000||Yen tell you why she wants this?
    446438|00000000||Mean you don't know?
    527920|00000000||And that, uh… doesn't bug you?
    527924|00000000||Great. Let's go.
    527921|00000000||Great. Let's go.
    527926|00000000||Something about Yen bothering you? C'mon, grow a pair, give it to me straight.
    527928|00000000||You grow a pair and admit she tricked you. More than a few times.
    527930|00000000||That was then. Yen's changed.
    527932|00000000||Right. Fine, never mind… Let's go.
    527922|00000000||Got something against Yen?
    527934|00000000||No, it doesn't. I trust her.
    527936|00000000||And they say people learn from their mistakes…
    527938|00000000||What was that?
    527940|00000000||Nothing, nothing.
    527942|00000000||No. I trust her.
    527941|00000000||Of course it bothers me.
    527944|00000000||Course it does… Don't see us lifting the curse without her, though.
    527946|00000000||We could've gone to Triss for help.
    527948|00000000||Put it to you this way… If Yen can't help Uma, we can always go to Triss - she won't hold it against us. But if we'd done it the other way around…
    527950|00000000||Oof… There'd be hell to pay.
    527952|00000000||Exactly. Enough of this talk. Let's go.
    387075|00000000||Gonna tell me which side of the knife to cut with next?
    416853|00000000||The sharp one. C'mon, hurry up.
    394354|00000000||You don't say…
    512160|00000000||All right. Let's collect the spinal fluid and get outta here.
    512162|00000000||Cut into its back, just below the skull.
    529475|00000000||Better safe than sorry.
    529481|00000000||When someone's life might be threatened, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Enough said.
    529483|00000000||Course. The noble White Wolf never abandons a man in need. He's more saint than witcher!
    529485|00000000||Changing subjects… Did I see right? Was that boy--?
    529487|00000000||Yeah. One of ours. Must've drowned during his Trial… Foglets remembered his voice and appearance.
    529489|00000000||Charming…. Let's get out of here.
    529490|00000000||Needn't ask me twice. In fact, I didn't even wanna come here.
    529491|00000000||Lambert, enough.
    529477|00000000||Dandelion should sing about you instead. "Lambert, the Smart-Ass Witcher."
    529479|00000000||Better that than naive. Smart asses live longer.
    529474|00000000||Should sing about you instead.
    527855|00000000||An illusion… Who woulda thunk?
    527856|00000000||You're not gonna let this drop anytime soon, are you?
    529473|00000000||No, I will not. In fact, whole world should hear about the time the famed Geralt of Rivia was duped like a child. Think we oughta get Dandelion to write a ballad about it. How's that sound?
   1029901|00000000||Took a lot of trouble to hide this passage behind an illusion.
   1029950|00000000||"Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers."
   1029951|00000000||Somebody's notes on the first page.
   1030005|00000000||Notes describe how to open a passage in the mine.
   1055124|00000000||Might be worth seeing what's down there.
   1030028|00000000||An iron mine. Depleted centuries ago.
   1030039|00000000||Something behind these roots…
   1030073|00000000||An elemental. Summoned by a mage and left as a sentry.
   1030405|00000000||Notes say I gotta place the book in the right spot…
   1030811|00000000||Medallion's humming - there's magic here.
   1030893|00000000||No ordinary forge. Medallion's sensing magic.
   1030894|00000000||Oughta look around.
   1031014|00000000||Fire's out. Let's see what's behind the hearth.
   1031234|00000000||A secret compartment, behind an illusion.
   1043631|00000000||Hm… a blacksmith's bellows.
   1056394|00000000||Can't be any harder than brewing a potion…
   1056613|00000000||All right, let's get to work.
   1056430|00000000||Hmm… Not so sure about this…
   1056416|00000000||An eggless omelet… Doubt that'll pass muster.
   1056405|00000000||Edible, I think…
   1056468|00000000||Need to add anything else?
   1056458|00000000||Don't have any onion…
   1056456|00000000||No peppers…
   1056454|00000000||No mushrooms.
   1056460|00000000||Hmm… No eggs…
   1064514|00000000||Edible… I think.
   1064510|00000000||Good enough.
   1056914|00000000||Argh. Gotta start over. Need some more ingredients.
   1056407|00000000||[Start again.]
   1056412|00000000||This is a disaster…
   1056414|00000000||Wouldn't serve this to a dog.
   1056396|00000000||[Stop cooking.]
   1056408|00000000||[Get additional ingredients.]
   1064511|00000000||Let's try again.
   1056424|00000000||Ugh… I can't serve this to Yen…
   1056422|00000000||Scrambled eggs, it's gotta be.
   1056426|00000000||Might've added too many ingredients...
   1056420|00000000||An omelet, no denying that.
   1056410|00000000||A bit of this, a bit of that, mix it all together…
   1056406|00000000||[Cook.]
   1056469|00000000||[Add ingredients.]
   1056395|00000000||[Add ingredients.]
   1043725|00000000||Lot of drowner corpses lying around… Hunter's gotta be one powerful beast.
   1043764|00000000||This is getting old. Some overgrown brute murdered a whole swarm of drowners.
   1043723|00000000||Another drowner… Even more mangled.
   1043719|00000000||Drowner corpse… Whatever mutilated it sure wasn't human.
   1043777|00000000||Troll. Haven't seen one this big in a while… Gotta be ancient.
   1047841|00000000||Something tells me it got a little angry.
    514783|00000000||Ugh.
    514785|00000000||Leaking again, dammit…
   1075505|00000000||Dammit, Geralt, stop running around. Look like a piece of shit in an ice hole. Let's get up there and get this over with, all right?
   1075492|00000000||Ready?
   1075498|00000000||Oooooff… You fat fuck.
   1075501|00000000||One… Two… Three!
   1075559|00000000||You're no feather, either. C'mon, let's go.
   1075494|00000000||Shit… Too damn high.
   1075503|00000000||Not if I give you a boost. Remember? Part of the Trials. "A witcher is a lone hunter--"
   1075561|00000000||"…but even a lone hunter can use a helping hand sometimes." Vesemir.
    529293|00000000||Let's go. Jump in the boat.
    529295|00000000||All right. I'm taking the tiller, though.
    529297|00000000||Because…?
    529299|00000000||Cause it's my boat. Not up for discussion.
    529287|00000000||Jump in the boat.
    529288|00000000||That still bother you?
    529305|00000000||That still gnawing at you?
    529307|00000000||Gnawing? No. Straight old pisses me off.
    529308|00000000||What the fuck was that Trial for? Most who returned from the Circle of Elements died within a year in some swamp, hunting drowners for a crown thirty a head. So exactly what was the point?
    529318|00000000||Oughta ask Vesemir.
    529320|00000000||Oh, I have, many times. Believe you me.
    527432|00000000||All right. Cave entrance is just opposite. See it?
    529278|00000000||Gotta sail across the pond, go through the cave, climb Troll's Head… and we're there.
    529280|00000000||Doesn't seem like such an ordeal now, does it?
    529282|00000000||No… Still gives me the shivers, though. You know only two boys returned from my group?
    529284|00000000||You were the ones who ran into Old Speartip in the caverns, right?
    529286|00000000||Mhm.
   1000037|00000000||You think universals exist as real and distinct entities, or only as mental constructs?
   1000039|00000000||Umaumaumauma mauma eme eme eme eme.
   1000041|00000000||Mhm. So do I.
   1000035|00000000||Do universals exist as real and distinct entities?
   1000026|00000000||How can I help you?
   1000028|00000000||Uma uma.
   1000017|00000000||How can I help you?
   1000020|00000000||So long.
   1000018|00000000||Take care.
   1000016|00000000||I'm looking for Ciri.
   1000022|00000000||I'm looking for Ciri. Ashen hair, scar on her cheek. Seen her?
   1000024|00000000||Uma! Uma! Umamama!
   1000015|00000000||Can we talk?
    522194|00000000||We'll see.
    522236|00000000||I dunno. Guess we'll see.
    522238|00000000||Geralt, you're in a hurry to get her, I understand. But you-- We can't act blindly.
    522534|00000000||You got something in mind, don't you. Come on, spit it out.
    522195|00000000||We'll be waiting.
    522240|00000000||We'll be waiting for them. Swords in hand.
    522242|00000000||Yes…
    522464|00000000||Come back quickly, Geralt.
   1059162|00000000||All right. Time I was on my way.
    522425|00000000||Good luck, Wolf. And give Cirilla our love.
    522427|00000000||And you? What do you plan to do?
    522429|00000000||I've Avallac'h to care for. He's certain to die without gentle, gradual magic treatment. There's hope if I help him. Not much, but better than naught.
    522431|00000000||The boys and I'll consider how we should greet our uninvited guests.
    522406|00000000||What'll you do?
    522405|00000000||I'll gather allies.
    522423|00000000||Fine. I'll get Ciri, and recruit some allies. Bring everyone here. Got a few favors I can call in.
   1059157|00000000||Any good looking women in that batch?
   1059160|00000000||Mhm. Exclusively.
    522244|00000000||Time we the hunted became the hunters. Geralt will find Ciri and bring her here… and the Hunt will follow.
    522277|00000000||They'll expect to catch us by surprise - and they'll be sorely disappointed.
    522279|00000000||We plan to fight them? We five? In a crumbling castle?
    522375|00000000||Do we have a choice? Besides delaying the inevitable?
    522376|00000000||Pretty boy could try to round up a few others who know how to swing a sword…
    522400|00000000||… or wield magic.
    522232|00000000||What's your suggestion?
    522234|00000000||Ciri can't flee forever. One day she'll stumble. And she won't get a second chance.
    522193|00000000||What do you suggest?
    522173|00000000||I'm going to get Ciri.
    522175|00000000||Hold up. Don't you think you owe us some answers? How do you know this Avallac'h? What's Ciri been doing with him?
    522177|00000000||Yennefer can tell you, just keep an eye on him. He's not a friend.
    522179|00000000||Perhaps not, but Ciri apparently trusted him. We should at least take his words seriously.
    522181|00000000||You heard what he said - take Ciri from that Isle of Mists and the Hunt'll pick up her trail immediately. What then?
    522138|00000000||I'm going after Ciri.
    522139|00000000||Will he recover?
    522183|00000000||Is he gonna make it?
    522185|00000000||I can't… know. You saw. Not all went as planned. I lifted the curse, but…
    522187|00000000||The Trial has wrought havoc in his body.
    522189|00000000||Violently twitching fingers, pupils that don't react to the light… Seen it many times before. Too many.
    522191|00000000||Toxins have permanently damaged his nervous system. Even if he does pull through… Do you understand?
    522129|00000000||I tried to protect her… But the curse…
    522131|00000000||The Hunt has not found the Isle… As yet… 'Tis a matter of time. But if she leaves… They will detect her… At once…
    522137|00000000||Enough, Geralt. He's not yet free of death's grip.
    522107|00000000||Isle of Mists - where is it?
    522109|00000000||Everywhere… and nowhere…
    522111|00000000||Listen, Sage. We didn't lift that curse to play riddles with you.
    522113|00000000||Praevein, arwein, cyrraen…
    522121|00000000||In Skellige… Follow it… Into the mists. Hurry… Hurry!
    522095|00000000||The Isle of Mists - where's that?
    522096|00000000||What does the Hunt want from her?
    522123|00000000||The Hunt - what's it want from Ciri?
    522125|00000000||Her blood… Elder Blood… to open the gate.
    522127|00000000||We cannot… we cannot allow this.
    514674|00000000||Avallac'h…?
    522083|00000000||You know him?
    522085|00000000||Yes. An elf, Aen Elle. A Sage…
    522089|00000000||Where is Ciri?
    522087|00000000||Hidden… the Isle of Mists… But… it's not… she's not safe… The Hunt…
    570855|00000000||Nevid, cyvir!
   1072717|00000000||Caniatad… Nevid… Cyvir…
   1072719|00000000||Coalle… Ariva… Aendir…
    570857|00000000||No… no, I won't let you!
    570859|00000000||Geralt! Yellow flask! In my satchel!
    570861|00000000||Quiet. Listen.
    570863|00000000||Coalle… Coalle… Caniatad…
    570865|00000000||Nevid, cyvir! Coalle, coalle caniatad!
   1072723|00000000||Nevid! Ariva! Aendir!
   1072721|00000000||Geralt! The phylactery! Open it!
   1072725|00000000||Caniatad! Taron Anede! Dis!
    535863|00000000||I don't take orders from you.
    535867|00000000||No courtesies needed? Perfect.
    535869|00000000||But remember, I'm not your soldier, or page, or dog. So don't give me any orders.
    535871|00000000||Would you prefer I order my guards? Look around. I need only beckon.
    535873|00000000||Geralt!
    535875|00000000||Now report.
    536275|00000000||So be it.
    536288|00000000||Fine.
   1084020|00000000||Wait.
   1084022|00000000||Here.
   1084024|00000000||Probably better if you keep it.
   1084102|00000000||Of course.
   1084105|00000000||I'm off.
    536390|00000000||So, how do we lift Uma's curse?
    536392|00000000||We must take him to Kaer Morhen.
    536396|00000000||I'll explain once we get there. Oh, and Geralt… Forgive me, but I'm unable to teleport you, Uma and Roach, so…
    536398|00000000||Don't worry. We'll ride there. Never did like teleporting.
    536400|00000000||Take care of yourself.
    536332|00000000||The curse - how do we lift it?
    556728|00000000||No more. Please.
   1086455|00000000||Yen...
   1018607|00000000||Please, Geralt. There's nothing left to say.
   1086453|00000000||Yen, what happened back there - in Skellige...
   1086451|00000000||Yen, sorry I refused to help you in Skellige.
    536333|00000000||Your biting wit - where'd it go?
    536335|00000000||Could've used some of that famous biting wit of yours. Where'd it disappear to? I mean, you were meek as a novice at Aretuza called in to the dean's office.
    536337|00000000||I merely know when I can indulge my pride, and when I must swallow it.
    536402|00000000||Unlike some others I know.
    536404|00000000||Ah, I see. So you show your claws to me because I'm a lowly witcher, but--
    536406|00000000||Do you really wish to do this now, Geralt?
    536408|00000000||We can fight another time, in another place. Where the walls have no ears.
    536331|00000000||This audience is over. Till the next.
    536284|00000000||Wouldn't count on that happening.
    536286|00000000||That was no request. It was an order, Geralt. And I advise you well… Do not disobey me.
    536274|00000000||I don't intend to bring her here.
    536219|00000000||This "monstrosity" might well be your daughter. Its body is the product of a curse. Someone hides inside it.
    536225|00000000||Can you lift this curse?
    536227|00000000||I've done a great deal of research, made inquiries… but to lift it, I would need to know the words used to cast it, and that--
    536229|00000000||"Va fail, elaine - cáed'mil, folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus."
    536231|00000000||Dandelion told me. Ciri talked to him about it.
    536233|00000000||At last, you provide a pleasant surprise. Lady Yennefer, my question stands.
    536235|00000000||Yes. I believe I can. But I must--
    536263|00000000||The details do not interest me. Geralt, you've achieved precious little - yet admittedly more than the bumblers in my spy corps have. I give you half the promised reward. You will receive the other when you bring me Ciri.
    535884|00000000||This monstrosity might be your daughter.
    535885|00000000||I know where Ciri was, what she did.
    536038|00000000||I pursued those leads you gave me.
    536040|00000000||Ciri first reappeared in Skellige. With a mage, an elf. Yen knows more.
    536042|00000000||The Wild Hunt tracked them down, found them there. They were forced to flee to Velen.
    536044|00000000||Where they were separated. Ciri spent some time with a local warlord, a self-styled baron who--
    536046|00000000||Yes, yes. I know my vassals.
    536048|00000000||…who helped her get to Novigrad, where Ciri crossed some of the city's underworld bosses. She had to flee, went back to Skellige. Ran into her elf companion there.
    536050|00000000||And into the Wild Hunt, again. Ciri and the elf fled, out to sea this time. Their boat returned to shore the next day with only him on board.
    536052|00000000||Hm… The information appears of little use. Though, at least, it seems you kept busy.
    536030|00000000||Listen, I'm looking for a needle in a haystack. A needle that at any moment can--
    536032|00000000||It's a difficult task, I know this. What of it?
    536034|00000000||Listen to me. I rule the largest empire the world has ever known. I wage a war against the North, command men in the tens of thousands, while at home, the trade corporations and nobles seek to depose me.
    536036|00000000||You cannot expect me to pity you the difficulty of your task.
    535877|00000000||Ciri… Well, this… man is the key to finding her.
    535879|00000000||Ummamamama…
    535881|00000000||I give you three solid leads, trails as fresh as morning dew, the aid of my spies and my court sorceress. Yet in my daughter's stead, you bring me this… monstrosity?
    535883|00000000||I hope you have more to say - for your sake.
    535865|00000000||As you wish, Your Majesty.
    535862|00000000||Have it your way, Your Majesty.
    535859|00000000||Your Imperial Majesty… Yennefer…
    535861|00000000||I did not have you brought here for an exchange of courtesies. Report.
    405711|00000000||… and the Third Army will sweep in from the west to take Ban Gleán.
    406214|00000000||If I may, Your Imperial Majesty… Our spies report that the garrison at Ban Gleán consists almost wholly of mercenaries.
    410870|00000000||Bribery, then?
    441526|00000000||We stand to lose exactly no men in battle.
    405715|00000000||And we stand to lose less time. Very well, give the orders. Then set sail.
    441528|00000000||As you wish. At once.
    571899|00000000||Hey, little guy.
    571903|00000000||This here's Roach.
    571913|00000000||She'll take us to Kaer Morhen.
    571905|00000000||Well, come on.
    571907|00000000||What the…?
    571909|00000000||Quit playing around. Let's go.
    530004|00000000||Spilled some wine… and crawled through it.
    530005|00000000||Had to kneel down to see that?
    535513|00000000||If I'd a' bent over, I'd 'ave puked…
    531534|00000000||Eskel! Eskeeeeeel!
    531536|00000000||Eeeeskeeeeeel!
    532425|00000000||Think he… think he hurt himself.
    532495|00000000||What's one scar more or less in his case? Makes no difference, as I see it.
    532426|00000000||Hey… Hic! Hear that?
    532427|00000000||Sounded like… panting… of a wounded wyvern…
    532428|00000000||Dammit… We missed a fight!
    532436|00000000||Aha… Eskel's close…
    532514|00000000||Hang in there, brother! We're coming!
    540831|00000000||Eskel! Chop chop!
    540834|00000000||Eskel, you drunk! Get out here!
    516028|00000000||Oh, meant to tell you… Can't get to the Circle through the mountains. Rockslide blocked the pass last spring.
    529102|00000000||So we approach from the pond side… Like when we did the Trial of the Medallion?
    529104|00000000||Exactly. Remember the way?
    529106|00000000||Not easily forgotten, that.
    530081|00000000||"He who returns with his medallion will prove himself worthy and may set off on the Path."
    530083|00000000||Vesemir ever hear you impersonate him?
    530085|00000000||Yeah. Old man can't stand it.
    513978|00000000||"As for forktails, bait them thusly: pound a stake in the soil, bind a goat to it, then hide ye in nearto shrubbery posthaste."
    513980|00000000||Brother Adalbert's bestiary, page eighty-two. See your memory's back in full, and sharp as ever, in spite of your years.
    518294|00000000||You're as old as I am, wise guy. Don't let the gray hair fool you.
    518428|00000000||Looks aren't everything to all women.
    518434|00000000||Looks aren't everything - certainly not to all women.
    518436|00000000||You're right… But most like a full purse, too. Don't have much to brag about in that domain either.
    513988|00000000||You too.
    513998|00000000||You too. How are things?
    514008|00000000||Same ol', same ol'. Another day, another drowner.
    514009|00000000||That it?
    514020|00000000||I'm a simple witcher, Wolf. Don't fight dragons, don't fraternize with kings and don't sleep with sorceresses… Unlike some.
    518444|00000000||Try to limit myself to the sorceresses from now on.
    518446|00000000||No doubt the most pleasant part… though I'm not sure it ain't the most dangerous, too.
    518438|00000000||Try to limit myself to sleeping with sorceresses.
    518437|00000000||Consider yourself lucky.
    518440|00000000||Fame's not all it's made out to be… Consider myself lucky if I were you.
    518442|00000000||You're right. Takes a lotta champagne to wash down all that caviar. That is tough goin'.
   1075664|00000000||[DEBUG] [Skip to end.]
    514024|00000000||Shh! Hear that? Incoming!
    518430|00000000||Come on. You're a handsome guy in your own way…
    518432|00000000||Geralt, please… Cut the crap.
    518427|00000000||You're not that bad looking.
    513990|00000000||Yen's keepin' you pretty busy, huh?
    513992|00000000||Mhh. Started shouting out orders with just one foot outta the teleport. I tried to get a word in edgewise, to which she said--
    513994|00000000||"One should not interrupt a lady."
    513996|00000000||Exactly. Times like these I'm glad this ugly mug of mine keeps the women away.
    513987|00000000||Yen keeping you busy?
    518296|00000000||Good to finally see you again.
    518290|00000000||Whereas you're getting hard of hearing in your old age… Squawking grouse could've snuck up on you.
    518292|00000000||Nah, heard you panting from three miles away. Just didn't wanna give up that vantage point.
   1027947|05ac068c||Chort
   1021681|00000000||A wolf head? I know this place. They held the first Trials of the Grasses here, before they built the fortress…
   1021748|00000000||Almost washed away. A few more decades and it'll be gone… Just like the witchers.
   1021774|00000000||A place where monster slayers were created… now infested with monsters. Near dripping with irony.
   1021878|00000000||Mutations were carried out here… Nice acoustics. Kids' screams must've carried far.
   1042943|00000000||Table for mutations… Like our Sad Albert, except even sadder.
   1042947|00000000||That smell… mutagens. Makes me wanna vomit despite the years.
   1042992|00000000||The lab… Where they brewed the potions. Poisons, more like.
   1043009|00000000||Prepared the herbs here. Corn lily, nightshade, wolfsbane… Nature's finest.
   1043011|00000000||A vat for seeping the herbs. I remember those teas they gave us…
   1043020|00000000||No idea what this was for… Maybe that's for the better.
   1043018|00000000||Some contraption… Broken.
   1059841|00000000||All done. You can go.
   1059844|00000000||Now… let's check your conditioned reflexes…
   1059167|00000000||How goes it? Vesemir's not working you too hard, I hope?
   1059169|00000000||Uma.
   1059171|00000000||Thought so.
    517228|00000000||What's in these crates?
    526944|00000000||Dimeritium bombs. Lambert made 'em.
    526946|00000000||No wonder the megascope doesn't work. All right, gotta get 'em outta here.
    526948|00000000||I can do that. Rather you not make a mess of my shelves. Just keep an eye on Uma.
    526950|00000000||Yes, Uncle Vesemir.
    515257|00000000||Disturbance is coming from there.
    528460|00000000||That a problem?
    528462|00000000||No… Just… my last hunt in mountains, griffin knocked me off a rock face.
    528464|00000000||Ouch.
    528466|00000000||Yeah. Dropped twelve yards, twisted my ankle, broke a rib… But you shoulda seen the griffin.
    528446|00000000||That a problem?
    528445|00000000||You could use the exercise.
    528448|00000000||Bit of exercise'll do you good.
    528450|00000000||Huh?
    528452|00000000||Well… you've rounded out a bit… Still got some of last winter's blubber on you.
    528454|00000000||Speak for yourself, funny bunny…
    526896|00000000||Foul, overgrown reptiles - hate it when they do that… Mighta saved us some trouble, let us kill it now.
    526897|00000000||Mhm. Then maybe gut itself, run a spit down its throat and out its ass?
    527840|00000000||Damn straight. Doubt the beast's that well-mannered, though… We gotta climb.
    530905|00000000||Let's go… Lemme just untie Lil' Bleater.
    530907|00000000||Lil' Bleater… Make it home all right on his own?
    530908|00000000||Course. Not the first hunt he's helped me with. C'mon. Get.
    530901|00000000||Right, talked enough. We've got a goat to avenge.
    529379|00000000||Fine, consider yourself vindicated. You were right…
    529381|00000000||Well, well… Whaddaya know!
    529383|00000000||We can talk about that later. Got the foglets to take care of now.
    527741|00000000||Hey, little guy…
    528045|00000000||Aaaaah!
    527743|00000000||It's all right. You're safe now.
    528046|00000000||No… No…. Help!!!!
    526405|00000000||So where is everyone?
    526406|00000000||Eskel's hunting forktails. Gotta nip that infestation in the bud, and since Yennefer needs to distill some ingredients from their organs… Well, like they say, two birds, one stone.
    526407|00000000||Lambert's still in the keep, preparing to venture into the mountains to enrich the phylactery with elemental power.
    526408|00000000||Mhm. And Yen?
    526409|00000000||Assembling her megascope. Wanted my help - running around with some chirping contraption, searching for something. But I'm too old for that… nonsense.
    533853|00000000||I should let her know I'm here.
    533855|00000000||If you say so. But… Don't go thinking she'll throw her arms around your neck.
    526274|00000000||Where is everyone?
    526466|00000000||She's up to something…
    526468|00000000||Glad you noticed.
    526444|00000000||Sounds suspicious…
    526470|00000000||She's gotta have a good reason…
    526472|00000000||Huh, more than one, most likely… In any case, she's set her mind on something. Needs us to stay out of her way, mostly.
    526445|00000000||Must have her reasons.
    526437|00000000||So what's Yen planning?
    526439|00000000||Wish I knew.
    526441|00000000||Mean she didn't tell you?
    526443|00000000||She told us what she needs to lift the curse, not what she plans to do with it. Despite our asking.
    526429|00000000||What's Yen planning?
    526275|00000000||That was a good bed.
    526323|00000000||Shame, that was a good bed.
    526325|00000000||Said the same myself. Solid oak frame, down mattress. Triss always said she--
    526350|00000000||Aaaah… Now I see.
    526397|00000000||It's either that, or Yen really hates oak furniture.
    526239|00000000||Yen's here already?
    526241|00000000||And how.
    526243|00000000||Huh… You two argue?
    526244|00000000||Geralt… I understand she's a-- well, how do I put this? Emancipated, strong-willed woman… But do manners count for nothing?
    526247|00000000||She teleports in, not even a "nice to see you." Jumps right into, uh - "We've a curse to lift. There's this to do, and that - so Eskel and Lambert, get going." Then she went to the guest room, to rearrange things… threw the bed off the balcony.
    526087|00000000||Yen's already here?
    526088|00000000||Why so dirty?
    526090|00000000||Don't look all that nice yourself. How'd you get so dirty?
    526132|00000000||Huh? Ah, this… I was mixing some lime for the mortar. Need to patch up the walls before they crumble.
    526235|00000000||Lotta work for one person. Lambert and Eskel not willing to help? Don't see the sense in it?
    526237|00000000||No. Yennefer found more important things for them to do.
    526084|00000000||And your journey - how was it?
    526086|00000000||Calm, if you don't count the forktail that flew over our heads a few miles back. Passenger got a little restless.
    443152|00000000||Uuummmmma…
    526431|00000000||Hm, what have we here? Multiple deformities. Eyes, ears, nostrils. A harelip. And is this…?
    526433|00000000||Ummmamamama!
    526435|00000000||Now, now. Calm down… Yennefer was right on one count… Thing sure isn't pretty.
    443103|00000000||Whoa there, Roach. It's all right.
    443316|00000000||Forktails this close to the fortress? Someone's been slacking off…
    443109|00000000||Well, look who the wind blew in! Been away quite a while.
    443112|00000000||Too long.
    527420|00000000||Dammit… Gonna chain that boat down next time.
    529192|00000000||Stop talking and listen.
    527423|00000000||Make this boat yourself?
    529195|00000000||Yeah. Something you don't like about it?
    529197|00000000||Besides the water up to our ankles? Nothing.
    529199|00000000||Quit whining… It'll make it across the lake.
    529201|00000000||Provided we don't smash into something first. Barely see the tip of my nose.
    527427|00000000||Fog's thick as curdled milk…
    529204|00000000||Never took you for a poet.
    529206|00000000||Oh, but I am one. Wanna hear a limerick?
    529208|00000000||Sure.
    529210|00000000||Lambert, Lambert - what a prick.
    529212|00000000||Not bad.
    527518|00000000||Mind not stomping like that?
    530647|00000000||Relax… I slipped.
    527514|00000000||Ugh!
    530650|00000000||What?
    530988|00000000||Something fell in my eye. A splinter, I think.
    530990|00000000||Hope it wasn't from a broken mirror… That'd make you even nastier.
    530992|00000000||Ha, ha.
    527515|00000000||Oof, place reeks of mould…
    530727|00000000||What'd you expect? Scent of violets?
    530729|00000000||Would've been nice…
    531130|00000000||Now that's the kind of negotiating I understand.
    531132|00000000||Thought you might like it.
    531134|00000000||And I thought you'd drag that conversation out forever… Surprised me.
    531136|00000000||Even my patience has its limits.
    527516|00000000||Think you might've missed your calling.
    531111|00000000||Hm?
    531113|00000000||If I remember Pappy Vesemir's lessons correctly, witchers kill monsters.
    531115|00000000||Your memory's shit. They only kill harmful monsters.
    531117|00000000||They threw stones at us, Geralt.
    531119|00000000||Whine about it to Eskel later.
    527517|00000000||Just… a few steps more… and we're there.
    531122|00000000||Oo, that's some serious panting. Out of breath, out of shape.
    531124|00000000||Nah… Just a bit… hungover.
    531126|00000000||Been hitting the hooch with Eskel again?
    531128|00000000||No… Been hitting it alone…
    530652|00000000||How'd it go? Water, then earth… then air?
    528350|00000000||Right… Almost there.
    528723|00000000||Hah! See 'im shit and run soon as he saw us?
    528724|00000000||Mhm. Never known a troll to do that.
    529777|00000000||Dammit… Blocked.
    529778|00000000||Relax… Aard oughta take care of it.
   1058885|00000000||Hm, see you changed your mind. Good call.
   1058889|00000000||Hey! Thought we were going straight to the cave?
   1058892|00000000||Shhh. Shut up and follow my lead.
   1058930|00000000||And they call me grumpy…
   1058897|00000000||Fall off a bit, sail's fluttering.
   1058899|00000000||Don't teach your grandma to suck eggs.
   1058907|00000000||Hmm… Wall looks a little shaky… Aard, maybe?
   1058909|00000000||Mhm. And wake Old Speartip?
   1058911|00000000||What? You afraid?
   1058913|00000000||No. I just think before I act.
   1062184|00000000||Water hag...
   1062758|00000000||Great. Last thing we needed.
   1074473|00000000||Harpies. Lovely.
   1074475|00000000||Relax. I'll shoot 'em down.
   1074622|00000000||Hope your aim's good. They smash the boat, we'll be in for a nice swim.
   1074630|00000000||Well, well, color me impressed. Where'd you learn them tricks?
   1074636|00000000||It's an art. Learned it from this old master down in Zerrikania.
   1074638|00000000||Pfff. Yadda yadda. Save that tale for your next sorceress.
   1074483|00000000||Hunting's almost a diversion with that gabriel. Gotta get me one.
    527327|00000000||Been thinking… We gonna swim across the pond?
    529140|00000000||No, I got a boat moored there. You know, for fishing.
    529142|00000000||Wow… Never took you for the fishing type.
    529144|00000000||I use bombs. Drop 'em in, then scoop up whatever floats to the surface.
    529146|00000000||Hm. That makes sense.
    534095|00000000||Savolla's breach. Still haven't patched it up?
    534985|00000000||Vesemir'd like to. Doesn't bother me, though.
    534987|00000000||Not expecting anyone to lay siege and… this way I got a shortcut to the pond.
    534989|00000000||Shame those Salamandra assassins didn't punch a few more holes in our walls.
    534991|00000000||Or finish the job and reduce these ruins to rubble.
    534101|00000000||Tell me about Vesemir - things any better between you?
    534994|00000000||Seems so… Old man's dropped the moralizing, and I try not to piss him off too often.
    535008|00000000||Mhm. Working out well?
    535066|00000000||Moderately. Castle's pretty big. Easy to stay out of each other's way.
    527329|00000000||Uh-oh. Looks like someone beat us to it.
   1074481|00000000||And that'd be about it.
   1074478|00000000||Nice shot.
    166754|68667754||Nilfgaardian Soldier
    530924|00000000||I'd rather be careful.
    530934|00000000||We oughta be careful. This is their turf.
    530936|00000000||Couple of trolls got you soiling your knickers?
    530938|00000000||Was bold and brash once, like you. Then I took a pitchfork in the gut. Peasant kid, not a troll - I almost died. Hard way to learn, but I did.
    530940|00000000||C'mon.
    530926|00000000||Dunno who you're trying to impress. Tough-guy stuff's just not working on me.
    530928|00000000||Heh, look who's talking. Vesemir told me about that job you did for those Nilfgaardians in Velen.
    530930|00000000||What… what are you doing?! "Killing monsters." Haha, good one.
    530932|00000000||Just came out that way…
    530923|00000000||Trying to impress me?
    528638|00000000||Oof… Good to be back above ground.
    528639|00000000||Mhm… Still trouble ahead.
    528640|00000000||Mean the trolls? They're in for trouble, not us.
   1022841|00000000||It's cold… unnaturally cold.
   1022843|00000000||Medallion's jumping. Boulder must be saturated with magic.
   1022844|00000000||Boulders form a triangle… affecting the magic aura. Thing is, who arranged them? Couldn't 'ave been Lambert…
   1022922|00000000||That smell… Some herb grew here.
   1022926|00000000||Dried needles. Juniper… or thuja.
   1022927|00000000||Seeds… Wolfsbane, I think.
   1022929|00000000||A rust-eaten sickle.
   1022932|00000000||Herb garden… probably cultivated by the mage in residence at Kaer Morhen. His magic made it a greenhouse… For a time.
   1022984|00000000||Could try to tune these stones… No point without some instructions, though.
   1023014|00000000||Mage's notes… Language is a bit archaic, but still intelligible.
   1023016|00000000||Mhm… Gotta hit two stones with Igni, and one with Aard. Piece of cake.
   1023388|00000000||Whoa-ho… Someone's clearly unhappy with the change in aura.
   1023940|00000000||It's gotten warm… Very warm. Even exotic herbs could grow in this temperature.
   1024065|00000000||Hey, hey. Got ourselves a botanical garden.
   1043120|00000000||Should glance at these papers…
   1043113|00000000||That didn't work.
   1043122|00000000||Maybe the mage left some instructions behind…
   1029116|00000000||Bastion's haunted by the ghost of a boy who trained here - and died here.
   1029117|00000000||Need to bury his remains… Maybe he'll leave then.
   1029133|00000000||A boy, twelve or so, no signs of mutation… They got him just like they got the others.
   1075359|00000000||Must be his ghost that haunts the bastion. Maybe he'll leave if I bury his bones…
   1029264|00000000||Pitchfork… No massacre's complete without one.
   1029322|00000000||Wraiths… They'll try to stop me.
   1029354|00000000||Take care, kid.
   1074733|00000000||Bones of a child… Wonder how they got here.
    514343|00000000||Slow down! You'll break your neck!
    514345|00000000||Home stretch!
    514341|00000000||I could beat you ridin' backwards!
    511888|00000000||Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests. Especially dull ones.
    526707|00000000||I mean, what got into you? That determined to make Vesemir your enemy?
    526716|00000000||No. I was determined not to sleep in the bed in which you swived Triss. Repeatedly.
    527367|00000000||Ah. So it is about Triss.
    527368|00000000||Yes. It's about our dear darling Triss.
   1061221|00000000||Geralt… I don't want to seem like a vindictive shrew, but that very bed is where you just happened to fuck a dear friend of mine.
   1061223|00000000||Yes, I know. You'd lost your memory. Whatever…
   1061267|00000000||Let us agree that I will refrain from scolding you, while you will stop mentioning that stupid bed. Agreed?
   1061269|00000000||Agreed.
   1061271|00000000||Splendid. On to more pressing matters.
    526750|00000000||Know what…? We should end this discussion - before I say something I'll regret.
   1056883|00000000||Come on. Triss? That's the past. You know that.
   1056885|00000000||I do. But that does not mean I've forgotten it.
   1056881|00000000||Triss - that's the past. You know that.
    527284|00000000||Told you… I lost my memory.
    527286|00000000||Yen… Told you already. I lost my memory.
    527288|00000000||And I've lost my patience.
    527292|00000000||Not about to grovel, if that's what you're after.
   1059059|00000000||I tire of this conversation. It ends. Now.
    527282|00000000||I won't grovel.
    527296|00000000||That… was a mistake.
    527298|00000000||I'm glad you realize it. A mistake engaged in regularly for more than a year, an apology well after the fact, but… I'm glad.
    527283|00000000||Made a mistake. I'm sorry.
    526997|00000000||But I'd love to hear what you have to say.
    526998|00000000||Is that so? Very well then. Listen.
    527276|00000000||You shagged my friend. For upwards of a year. I cannot know what your witchers' code says on the matter, but ordinary folk would consider it obscene, base, vile.
    527278|00000000||I try not to think about it… That stupid bed was making it difficult. That's that.
    526816|00000000||Come on. What's on your mind?
    526817|00000000||Fine. Let's change the subject.
    527000|00000000||If that's what you want.
    527280|00000000||Knew I could count on your better judgment.
    527290|00000000||Very well… On to more pressing matters. We've a great deal of work to do.
    527412|00000000||What's eating you?
    527414|00000000||Let me think - that was the… third crystal to explode. It's been a week and Lambert's still not done what I've asked. Vesemir spitefully insists on repairing the wall just beneath my window and starts hammering at the crack of dawn, while Eskel seems to have gone mushroom picking, not forktail hunting.
    527361|00000000||Mind telling us what you're planning?
    527263|00000000||The guys… well, they're not exactly happy with you.
    527265|00000000||Mhm. Why is that?
    527267|00000000||Because… you aren't willing to say what you're planning. You're treating them like pages, not including them - us, actually, 'cause I feel that way, too.
    527269|00000000||I shall explain everything - when the time is right. First, we must finish our preparations.
    526857|00000000||Don't trust us?
    527405|00000000||Hm. You got trust issues with us?
    527407|00000000||Ugh. No… Actually, I fear you don't trust me. So I'd rather keep certain things secret - for the time being.
    527409|00000000||Pretty tortured logic…
    527422|00000000||It may seem that way now… But you'll understand in time.
    535084|00000000||Ah, Geralt… Anything you'd like to say?
    533975|00000000||Mhm. The view from there - spectacular.
    535152|00000000||Perhaps I should've teleported you two miles higher? Breathtaking, that view! To die for, really.
    533972|00000000||That was some view.
    533971|00000000||Sorry.
    533973|00000000||Sorry… Pretty dumb excuse.
    533974|00000000||Extremely stupid. I'm glad a mere whiff of fresh air helped you realize that.
    527469|00000000||All right, I'll talk to them. Anything else?
    527470|00000000||Already helped Lambert, I'll go see what Eskel's up to. Anything else?
    527471|00000000||Already helped Eskel, I can check on Lambert. Anything else?
    527571|00000000||Yes. There's one other trifling matter.
   1061279|00000000||Ah! One more thing…
   1061281|00000000||Mhm?
   1061283|00000000||Thank you, Geralt.
    513763|00000000||Potesta… Potestaquisitor? Sounds fancy, complicated.
    514075|00000000||Yet it's ever so simple. Grasp it firmly, move it around, and the louder it squeals, the closer you are.
    514077|00000000||Mhm…
    532015|00000000||Spare me your juvenile wit, please. Well? What're you waiting for?
    513724|00000000||Use this potestaquisitor.
    513723|00000000||All right, how do I find the source?
    527574|00000000||How do I do this?
    527575|00000000||Who do you plan to contact?
    527577|00000000||Who you plan to contact? Or is that a secret, too?
   1061273|00000000||No secret at all. Ida Emean. Remember her?
    527579|00000000||First off, stop pouting. Second - no, it's no secret. Ida Emean. Remember her?
    527581|00000000||How could I forget. Member of the Lodge… Elven Sage.
    527583|00000000||Exactly. A Sage. As the name suggests, she should know a great deal. I'd like to ask her for advice about Uma. Satisfied?
    531641|00000000||Hmph… Your sorceress friends - the sage and not so sage - they've let me down before. But if we gotta, we gotta.
    531643|00000000||If only you'd been this cautious with all of them… But no matter. Thank you for your permission.
    527572|00000000||As you saw, my megascope's acting up… in rather spectacular fashion.
    527573|00000000||I'm certain there's an energy source nearby, generating disturbances, making the crystals malfunction. We must find it and neutralize it… quickly - I must contact someone, it's urgent.
    527472|00000000||Taken care of.
    527473|00000000||Is that so…? My, the initiative. That leaves one other trifle to resolve.
    527462|00000000||Fine… What do I do?
    527463|00000000||Firstly, help Eskel and Lambert. One was supposed to get me forktail spinal fluid, the other was to fortify the phylactery with elemental power. I've yet to see anything from either of them.
    526856|00000000||What do I do?
    527281|00000000||Heard what you did with the bed…
    527363|00000000||Heard about the bed… Really prefer to sleep on the floor? Wouldn't recommend it. That stone can get awfully chilly.
    527365|00000000||Frankly, I prefer a chill to bedding littered with red hair.
    526718|00000000||So upset about Triss you gotta take it out on the furniture?
    526748|00000000||Would you prefer I take it out some other way?
    526681|00000000||Need to blow off steam? Go ahead, just not on me. Find some other target. I don't know… throw another bed off the balcony.
    527271|00000000||Ha, ha, ha. So it's to be dull jokes after all?
    527273|00000000||Rather have a serious conversation? We can do that, if you prefer.
    526675|00000000||Calm down.
    526674|00000000||Something wrong?
   1061216|00000000||Geralt… I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for jests.
    511885|00000000||Akh akh akh… Damned crystal! Akh akh…
    526673|00000000||You decide to blow us up?
    527294|00000000||Certainly wouldn't hurt. But even a modicum of understanding would suffice.
    530158|00000000||Let us pass, or regret it.
    530166|00000000||Take my advice. You don't wanna mess with us.
    530168|00000000||Trolly advice take!
    530170|00000000||No… Trolls' advice! And witcherses takes must it!
    530172|00000000||Argh, enough. Outta my way, dimwits, or I'll grind you to gravel. Understand?!
    530175|00000000||Mhm. They understood all right. Congrats.
    530177|00000000||Run for the cave… Before they stone us to death.
    530160|00000000||Stay calm… We just wanna get to the Circle.
    530162|00000000||Witcherses thing one say, thing two do.
    530164|00000000||Thing three do. Sometime.
    530139|00000000||Just want to get to the Circle.
    528760|00000000||Oooo. Witcherses two, walk no more… stops! This mountain trolly mountain.
    530135|00000000||Troll mountain.
    530137|00000000||Huh? Ah… Aye. This troll mountain!
    528761|00000000||Ugh… You talk to these idiots.
   1027409|00000000||Handwriting looks familiar… Berengar's. Papers've been lying here for years.
   1027416|00000000||How about that. He was working on a sword… And not just any sword, judging by his notes."Tor'haerne."
   1043331|00000000||Oughta talk to Vesemir. Berengar consulted him. Vesemir might remember how far he got.
   1055702|5ec210eb||Drowned Dead
    527356|00000000||Dammit… Moored it right here, I swear.
    527357|00000000||Line must've come loose.
    529052|00000000||Really? Here I thought the boat untied itself, to go for jaunt on its own. Dammit, in this fog we'll never--
    529122|00000000||There a storm before I arrived?
    529123|00000000||Lemme think… Yeah. Five days past.
    529124|00000000||Mhm… Wind must've grabbed the sail, tugged the boat off its mooring, boat drifted into the bushes…
    529054|00000000||Shhh. Thought I heard something…
    521230|00000000||How 'bout that!
    521178|00000000||You guys ever gonna lay off Yen?
    521185|00000000||Will you ever lay off Yen?
    521187|00000000||Yeah. Soon as I trust her.
    521189|00000000||You'd brave a fire for her… Whereas she plays you like a cheap fiddle. Way it's always been.
    521191|00000000||Listen to you two goddam relationship experts. Neither of you's been with a sorceress…
    521193|00000000||For good reason…
    521195|00000000||Fine, leave pretty boy alone before he gets grumpy. Already has that pouty look on his face. Can't stand it.
    521197|00000000||Drink up, Geralt. To you and Yen - happily ever after!
    521179|00000000||Right, let's change the subject.
    521181|00000000||All right, change the subject.
    521183|00000000||Cause you refuse to admit I'm right? Whatever. Fine.
   1056888|00000000||Stop being a smart ass and pour.
   1056890|00000000||You can breathe easy. Yen and I - we're not a couple. And we won't ever be one…
   1056892|00000000||Ah, explains why the Sorceress Superior was so damn sulky.
   1056894|00000000||Lambert, drop it… Sorry, Geralt, that was, uh, insensitive. We didn't know. You wanna… wanna talk about it?
   1056896|00000000||No. I wanna drink.
   1056898|00000000||Doable. Definitely doable.
   1056886|00000000||Yennefer and I - we're not a couple.
    467507|00000000||So, what's this about a samovila?
    521169|00000000||Snared this peasant in her dance. Instead of bein' happy he escaped with his life, yokel fell head over heels in love.
    521171|00000000||Wanted me to trap her. Turned him down, so he tried it on his own, with a fishing net. Bet you they're still dancing a mazurka in some fallow field.
    521173|00000000||Great story. With a moral, too!
    521175|00000000||Really? What's that?
    521177|00000000||Stay away from dangerous women.
   1062159|00000000||So - this samovila?
    521056|00000000||I'd rather not.
    535662|00000000||I'd prefer to play for pleasure.
    535666|00000000||Can't get enough, can you? Whole castle heard you gettin' pleasured earlier…
    535664|00000000||Pleasure? You should really talk to Yen about that.
    521073|00000000||Got a one-track mind, Lambert. What are you, twelve?
    521075|00000000||His voice has started cracking. Haven't noticed?
    521077|00000000||Very funny.
    521079|00000000||Very funny!
   1056901|00000000||Hahaha!
    521081|00000000||All right, that's enough. Let's play.
    521058|00000000||Yeah… Unless you'd rather play strip gwent.
    521060|00000000||Maybe I'd finally come to understand what women see in you…
    521062|00000000||Compare your trouser snakes later. Pouches on the table!
   1051966|00000000||Hahaha!
    521065|00000000||What's with him?
    521067|00000000||Don't worry about it. Let's play.
    521055|00000000||Agreed.
    467489|00000000||How about a round of cards?
    467491|00000000||Why not. Playin' for coin, though, right?
   1062161|00000000||How about a round of cards?
    520920|00000000||All right, guys… Bed time.
    520922|00000000||Speak for yourself. Night's still young as I see it.
    520924|00000000||Huh, but we're not… And tomorrow's a big day.
    520926|00000000||Fine… Drinkin' with my mirror image is just no fun. Least it wasn't last time.
    520928|00000000||See? Even you can't stand yourself… Good night.
   1062162|00000000||Time to go to sleep.
    531366|00000000||Have you got some beef with me?
    531394|00000000||Lambert… Listen… You… You got a problem with me?
    531396|00000000||Me? Why… why would you say that?
    531398|00000000||Well… just seemed that way. And you know… you're a little like my little brother. Dumb and annoying. But a brother.
    531400|00000000||Geralt… dammit! You're gonna make me cry! Come here!
    531403|00000000||Damn… broke…
    531405|00000000||Good thing it was empty… Eh… Where's Eskel? Shoulda been back by now. We oughta… look around.
    531407|00000000||This is a job… for Vesemir!
    531409|00000000||Not again… Take that hat off…
    531410|00000000||Where's that whippersnapper wandered off to? He could be… beleaguered… I wager! Come, men, to the rescue!
    531386|00000000||Lambert… Bud… Gotta tell you something…
    531388|00000000||Yeah??
    531390|00000000||Sometimes you're… a real jackass… but… I love you, brother…
    531392|00000000||And sometimes you're a real blowhard. But dammit… I'd go to hell and back for you. Come here, you oaf!
    531365|00000000||Lambert… I like you, you know that, right?
    531359|00000000||Aah… Vodka… vodka's gone. Who's gonna go get some more?
    531361|00000000||Already went… to get food.
    531363|00000000||All right… I'll do it… Kitchen… It's that way, right?
   1062163|00000000||[DEBUG] [Skip to Eskel Drunk.]
   1062160|00000000||Let's have some fun.
    467499|00000000||C'mon… Let's have some fun.
    467505|00000000||We boring you?
    535660|00000000||No, it's just kinda…
    521216|00000000||Slow. Pretty boy's right. Listen… there's this game, student from Oxenfurt taught me.
    521218|00000000||Hm?
    521220|00000000||Someone starts by saying "I've never…" - and finishing the sentence however they want. Whosever done that thing, downs a shot. Then it's the next guy's turn.
    521222|00000000||Sounds great. You start.
    521224|00000000||I've never… slept with a succubus.
    521226|00000000||[Skip a round.]
    521225|00000000||[Drink.]
    521326|00000000||Expected Geralt might've, but you?
    521328|00000000||Eskel, Eskel… Still waters run deep.
    521330|00000000||I'm a sucker for women with horns.
    524846|00000000||Right, my turn. I've never, after a bender, woken up wearing nothing but my knickers.
    521331|00000000||[Drink.]
    521332|00000000||[Skip a round.]
    521341|00000000||Oh, Lambert, Lambert… Kaer Morhen's black sheep…
    521343|00000000||Wanna know the best part? They weren't even my knickers!
    521334|00000000||Geralt? Lambert's a lost cause, but you… What would Papa Vesemir say?
    521336|00000000||Think Papa Vesemir woulda… drank that round, too.
    521345|00000000||All right, Geralt, your turn. I've never…?
    521351|00000000||… jumped out a lover's window.
    521354|00000000||That so… Must've been one tough character whose wife you were ploughing…
    521356|00000000||That wasn't it… He was a friend. Didn't want to hurt his feelings.
    521358|00000000||Yeah, you're a true friend.
    521347|00000000||Never jumped out a lover's window.
    521346|00000000||Never taken fisstech.
    521360|00000000||…Taken fisstech.
    521363|00000000||Eskel… Really?
    521365|00000000||Once… With that succubus.
    521349|00000000||Right, men, let's end on that. Or else I'll never be able to look you in the eyes again.
    531289|00000000||Brrr… Colder'n up an ice giant's ass in here. Gentlemen, I shall return. Gotta go drain the dragon.
    531301|00000000||Gotta say I'm pretty warm…
    531303|00000000||He's always been a wuss about the cold. Remember winter, fifteen years ago, when the snow stayed around until Belleteyn?
    531304|00000000||Mhm… Lambert sat by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. Cussed copiously every time it started to snow…
    531291|00000000||Not cold in here to me…
    531290|00000000||You get along with Lambert?
    531293|00000000||You and Lambert get along?
    531295|00000000||In a way… I've learned not to talk to him about certain things.
    531297|00000000||Guessing that's quite a list.
    531299|00000000||It is.
    531328|00000000||Hullo, young 'uns! Got your own little carnival going, eh? Alcohol, my good men, is a witcher's worst enemy!
    531330|00000000||Where'd you dig up that bonnet?
    531332|00000000||Vesemir's trunk. The height of fashion in 1112! Old man probably put it on when he went courting! Or, in the jargon of the time, "wooing the damsels."
    531334|00000000||Men, a witcher's life is not all cards and liquor. It is toil, it is labor. No gurgling babes to wean for us, nay, not for us.
    531336|00000000||All right, one Vesemir's enough. Take that off before you get it dirty… And pour.
    531338|00000000||Oh, I'll pour, Eskel, I'll pour. To the brim. 'Cause without vodka, you're as stiff as a bookkeeper in a body cast.
   1075694|00000000||Good game, Geralt. Especially that move with the--
   1075696|00000000||Eskel, he doesn't need any praise. Just pour.
   1075700|00000000||Huh. So, Geralt, seems to me you got your ass whooped.
   1075708|00000000||Unlucky at cards, lucky in love. And vice versa.
    520893|00000000||What're you talking about?
    520895|00000000||Samovila contract Eskel got a while back. Good story.
    535532|00000000||Finish it in a minute. First, some more fuel.
    535534|00000000||Ooooh… Now that's a kick in the liver… What is it?
    535536|00000000||"The Gauntlet" - equal parts spirit and White Gull. What's that look about? Yen's gone to bed, time for some serious drinking.
    535538|00000000||Damn straight. Pour us another. Bottoms up!
    450392|00000000||Heh. Didn't listen, did he?
    520876|00000000||They never do.
    532252|00000000||Got you everything you need.
    532254|00000000||Splendid.
    523860|00000000||Clock's ticking…
    523867|00000000||Don't take this the wrong way, Vesemir, but clock's ticking.
    523869|00000000||I ask only one night's delay. If nothing comes of it, we'll do what Yennefer wants.
    528171|00000000||Something wrong?
    528245|00000000||Something not quite right?
    528297|00000000||Or three…
    528298|00000000||I'll hold you to that.
    528294|00000000||Sounds great.
    528300|00000000||Yen… Don't get mad, but--
    528302|00000000||Stop.
    528304|00000000||Suddenly, I've an immense desire to drink.
    528295|00000000||Don't get mad, but…
    528306|00000000||Wow, you don't exactly mince words…
    528308|00000000||I'm too old to play the blushing bride… Unless you ask nicely.
    528310|00000000||Shall we go? You can rejoin them afterwards. In an hour… or two.
    528312|00000000||I'm still mad at you… I've tension to release.
    528247|00000000||No, nothing. I just wanted to take you aside… without cluing the others into what we're up to.
    528249|00000000||Mhm… And what're we up to?
    528251|00000000||Sneaking upstairs to make love.
    528243|00000000||All right. What did I do this time?
    528170|00000000||What'd I do now?
    528166|00000000||Do as you will… But in a moment. Geralt and I must talk.
    528169|00000000||Oo, sounds serious. C'mon, Lambert… See you in a bit Geralt.
    524159|00000000||Sounds a lot better than the beams.
    524161|00000000||Wouldn't mind a shot myself. Or two.
    524163|00000000||Nothing I can do - been outvoted. Let's go.
    524155|00000000||Geralt gave me a bottle of Mahakaman spirit… That'll hit the spot for me.
    524148|00000000||So… got the evening off. What do we do with it?
    524150|00000000||Vesemir mentioned some roof beams in the tower need replacing. Maybe we could see to that.
    524153|00000000||Or… we could have a drink.
    524145|00000000||What now?
    524146|00000000||Vesemir's become a grumpy old man.
    524165|00000000||Vesemir's gotten a bit grumpy in his old age.
    524167|00000000||That was nothing. Shoulda been here last winter when Lambert tried to convince him we oughta abandon Kaer Morhen for good.
    524169|00000000||What good's this old ruin anyway? Moldy walls, leaky roof, and it's one big fucking ice cube in the winter.
    524171|00000000||Vesemir didn't say a word. Stood, grabbed his sword, and slammed the door on his way out. Didn't come back for a month.
    523871|00000000||I'll take Uma into the mountains.
    523873|00000000||What then? Will you howl at the moon together?
    523875|00000000||A bit of respect. You're not talkin' to Geralt.
    523877|00000000||No, we will not howl at the moon. I'll lay him down on a grave stone. Come midnight, I'll give him tea made of hemlock harvested from… But I don't see that I need to explain this to you.
    524812|00000000||In my opinion--
    523879|00000000||I know your opinion. But I'm not asking anyone's permission. I'm saying what will happen. I'll be back at dawn. With Uma… or whoever hides inside him.
    523862|00000000||What's this method?
    523864|00000000||Derives from folk traditions. I've used it many times, in 1211, to lift the curse that held the Swan of Poviss, for instance.
    523859|00000000||What's this other method?
    523850|00000000||Lambert, prepare the apparatuses. Eskel, go--
    523852|00000000||Last I heard, my dear, I give the orders around here. Not you.
    523854|00000000||I believe we made an agreement. To seek to cure Uma my way.
    523856|00000000||I said we would help you. That's it.
    523858|00000000||I don't know what you want to do with him - you haven't deigned to inform us. But it's not safe, is it?
    532247|00000000||Just as I thought. Which is why I think we should first try another, less invasive method.
    532250|00000000||Listen, everyone. All is in place. We may begin.
    529561|00000000||Soak it in later.
    530511|00000000||We can soak it in later.
    530513|00000000||Of course. Duty before pleasure.
    530515|00000000||Remember how this Circle works? Been a while since I activated my medallion here…
    530517|00000000||It's fine, old man, no need to make excuses. Light the torches and place the phylactery on the altar. I'll handle the rest.
    530503|00000000||Must be if you noticed it.
    530505|00000000||Geralt, who do you take me for?
    530507|00000000||Lemme think… a sourpuss?
    530509|00000000||Hah! Fair enough, but save the rest of your compliments for later. Let's get to work.
    529560|00000000||High praise coming from you.
    528853|00000000||Well… We made it.
    528854|00000000||No denying that.
    528856|00000000||Damn… Beautiful view.
    538320|00000000||Geeeralt… Where you off to?
    538321|00000000||Hey! Come back!
    539001|00000000||Yes! Perfect! Like it was made for you!
    539023|00000000||Sure… Soon as I let it out a bit in the waist…
    539025|00000000||Stop talking, get dressed. Not that one… Won't complement your complexion…
    538315|00000000||Sure brought a lot of crap… You'd think she was moving in…
    539020|00000000||Shh, you'll scare Geralt…
    527525|00000000||Think that's… yeah… Can hear the sail flapping.
    530578|00000000||Have a nice swim? Water not too cold for you?
    530580|00000000||Nope. Just right.
    530582|00000000||You're one strange duck… But I suppose I knew that already.
    527765|00000000||Ready for the caverns?
    530574|00000000||Almost. Before we go inside--
    530576|00000000||Ugh, drink a dose of Cat, I know. Any more words of wisdom? Like, "Step softly or you'll wake Old Speartip?"
    530590|00000000||Old Speartip's still down there?
    530592|00000000||Yeah, he is - unless he's done us a favor and keeled over on his own. Could come at us at any moment.
    530594|00000000||How'd the rhyme go? Old Speartip's a deep sleeper…
    530596|00000000||Wake him up and you'll sleep deeper. C'mon.
    530584|00000000||Old Speartip's still around?
    530583|00000000||You're pricklier than Yen.
    530586|00000000||Sheesh. You're pricklier than Yen…
    530588|00000000||Ugh. Don't fall in love with me. Let's go.
    528814|00000000||Aaaah! Help!
    528815|00000000||Hear that? Sounds like a kid…
    528816|00000000||You know this valley's uninhabited except for us. Gotta be an illusion.
    528817|00000000||What if it's not?
    528819|00000000||Aaa… Aaaaaah!
   1058953|00000000||Whatever you want to do…
   1058880|00000000||We'll investigate. Just in case.
   1058955|00000000||You know, Vesemir's right. You do poke the damn hive, almost always. Fine. Let's go.
   1058877|00000000||We should investigate. Just in case.
   1058878|00000000||You're probably right… Let's go to the cave.
   1058882|00000000||You're probably right… Let's go - straight to the cave.
   1058957|00000000||Finally, something reasonable.
    370082|00000000||Must be Eskel's prints… No one else has left the keep recently.
    526687|00000000||Footprints… and hoofprints. A goat. Interesting…
    526463|00000000||That's his horse… what's it's name? Scorpion? Beautiful animal…
    445080|00000000||Eskel made camp here… Looks like he planned to stay outside a while.
    526464|00000000||All right… Let's see where this aroma leads me.
    526473|00000000||Rocks… tracks end here. Great.
    526474|00000000||Could try to follow my nose. Can't smell Eskel, but there is the goat… Just gotta find a sample of its scent.
    526475|00000000||A clump of goat hair. Oof, the stench…
    526476|00000000||Damn… Can't smell a thing. Must've lost the trail.
    526557|00000000||Bits of bark… Looks like Eskel's goat rubbed against this tree.
    526753|00000000||Ha, Eskel's tracks… The nose knows.
   1030909|002ff636||Fire
   1055144|00000000||Listen, just wanna look around.
   1055146|00000000||Intruder! I cannot allow this!
   1074537|00000000||I will not allow it!
   1074539|00000000||NO! NOT ALLOWED!
   1055140|00000000||Wanna look around.
   1055153|00000000||Who are you?
   1055155|00000000||I am fire, this forge's soul. I am the flame that tempers steel.
   1055142|00000000||Who are you?
   1055141|00000000||Radmir of Tor Carnedd is dead.
   1055149|00000000||Radmir of Tor Carnedd? He was flayed alive during Falka's rebellion. A long time ago, that.
   1055151|00000000||You lie!
   1055137|00000000||Stand down.
   1055139|00000000||Begone! This place belongs to Radmir.
    515371|00000000||Everything's ready at my end.
    515358|00000000||No reason to wait. Let's go.
    515348|00000000||Let's go now.
    515362|00000000||Gotta take care of something. Wait for me.
    515364|00000000||Sure.
    515349|00000000||Got one thing to do, then we can go.
    528569|00000000||Don't sound too thrilled about all this.
    528571|00000000||I'm not. You know the trek to the Circle's no walk in the park. In more ways than one.
    528573|00000000||Lemme go with you.
    528598|00000000||Well… Might have more spring in my step with the famous White Wolf at my side. So… you ready?
    528524|00000000||Don't sound thrilled about this.
    528525|00000000||Monstrosity might be Ciri…
    528527|00000000||Realize that monstrosity, as you put it, might be Ciri?
    528529|00000000||Yeah. I heard.
    528531|00000000||Mind showing a bit of sympathy?
    528533|00000000||I call 'em like I see 'em. That's how I am.
    528583|00000000||Know what? Never mind. Not gonna argue with you.
    528585|00000000||Right, no time to lose. The monstrosity awaits.
    528587|00000000||Lambert!
    528600|00000000||Oh, sorry. The potential Cirilla.
    528567|00000000||Fine… Don't wanna fight.
    528534|00000000||Irritating?
    528575|00000000||Irritating, you mean?
    528577|00000000||Thought you liked people with bitchy streaks.
    528579|00000000||So long as they're women.
    528581|00000000||Then you found the best of 'em. Enough about that. The Circle of Elements awaits.
    528515|00000000||What's this? Brewing potions?
    528517|00000000||No. Booze. From potato peels.
    528519|00000000||Mm. For my welcome back feast?
    528521|00000000||Actually, more like my farewell feast…
    528523|00000000||Haven't heard? Madame sorceress has requested I fortify the phylactery with Power from the Circle of Elements. Says it's essential to lifting the curse from that monstrosity of yours.
    534982|00000000||This Circle no, this trolly hole. Yous go no in hole, yous no trolls.
    535004|00000000||Sharp backclub here… Or troll smash.
    534972|00000000||This what: witcherses two in pond?
    534973|00000000||Uh… troll no know.
    535386|00000000||Soup!
    535388|00000000||Harharhahar!
    534997|00000000||All say trolls stupid.
    535005|00000000||Cheaty witcherses! Cheaty witcherses!
    519499|00000000||Next time.
    519501|00000000||Bet you next time. Thing is, I'll win.
    519503|00000000||Yeah. Sure.
    519535|00000000||Finally! Took you a while.
    519537|00000000||Saddle kept sliding…
    519539|00000000||Mhm. Not a crappy show dancer out there who doesn't blame her shoes.
    519540|00000000||You're a fucking show dancer - but one who's damn good on horseback. Didn't wager anything, but can't help thinking you deserve a prize.
    519563|00000000||C'mon, not gonna take anything from you. Buy me a round some time and we'll call it good.
    519565|00000000||Done deal.
    519555|00000000||Don't need anything…
    519561|00000000||If you insist…
    519567|00000000||Since you insist…
    519569|00000000||Here. Use it wisely.
    519542|00000000||Have some for you next we meet.
    519552|00000000||Have a bottle for you next time we meet. Promise.
    519554|00000000||Hold you to that.
    519544|00000000||As luck would have it, gotta bottle with me… Here.
    519546|00000000||Damn… Must've read my mind long range!
    519548|00000000||Nah. Enjoy a swig from time to time, just like you.
    519550|00000000||Right… Vesemir used to say he couldn't tell us apart. Like brothers, two drops of water… A long time ago, that. Thanks.
    519541|00000000||Got some on me. All yours.
    519505|00000000||All right. Name your prize. Earned it.
    519507|00000000||Hm… Had this craving for Mahakaman spirit a while now. Nothin' burns quite like it.
    519498|00000000||Whaddaya want?
    518496|00000000||"I could beat you riding a lame sow"… Good one.
    519495|00000000||Underestimated you… Or should I say Scorpion. One fast mount.
    519497|00000000||And I overestimated you. If I'd known it'd be that easy I'd 'ave bet something on it…
    530893|00000000||You gonna live?
    530894|00000000||Mhm. Probably.
    531066|00000000||Let's get outta here.
    531068|00000000||Wait.
    531071|00000000||That's for Voltehre, you whoreson. Ptoo!
    531079|00000000||Voltehre… Who's that?
    531081|00000000||Ya don't remember? Little guy, scar on his chin, right here.
    531083|00000000||Oh, yeah. I remember.
    531085|00000000||All we can do now. Never made it outta here.
    531087|00000000||Let's go.
    531073|00000000||Voltehre… who's that?
    531072|00000000||Done?
    531075|00000000||You finished?
    531077|00000000||Let's move.
    526233|00000000||Uh-oh…
    526232|00000000||Gods dammit! You piece of shit!
   1027881|00000000||Down river as far as I can go… Shouldn't be too hard.
   1027942|00000000||River disappears here… I've gotta be close.
   1027943|00000000||Can't sail any further. Time to make for the bank.
   1027954|00000000||Whoa… An old, strong bull. No wonder Berengar got in trouble.
   1027955|00000000||So much for the chort… Now to find Berengar's things.
   1027957|00000000||Ah, the diagram. Forging the Tor'haerne won't be easy… but it's sure as hell worth a try.
   1056280|fb94e1c3||Ida Emean aep Sivney
   1056935|00000000||I don't know… Tell me a story.
    537931|00000000||Ever tell you about Dandelion buying me a sword?
    537941|00000000||Ever tell you about the time Dandelion bought me a sword?
    537943|00000000||Was that in Kerack? Just after we'd…
    537945|00000000||Decided to take a break. Yeah. My swords had… disappeared, doesn't matter how. And Dandelion insisted I had to be armed. Decided he'd buy me a weapon.
    537947|00000000||Came to me, beaming. "The truest Viroledan steel! Good price, too, so good it felt like I was stealing!"
    537949|00000000||Naturally, blade shattered first parry I threw.
    537951|00000000||Uuuuma…?
    537953|00000000||He's awake. It's time… time to lift the curse. Prepare the phylactery.
    537933|00000000||Heard about the time Ciri and I went ice skating?
    537935|00000000||No… Not that I recall.
    537937|00000000||The winter she trained here. Couple months in, she started complaining I was too harsh a teacher. Brushed it off at first.
    539018|00000000||Then she asked me to go skating with her. Didn't really want to, I'd never been before… But she insisted.
    537939|00000000||Soon as we hit the ice, she started skating circles around me, hollering "No, not like that! Footwork! One, then the other!" "Crossover! No! Wrong!" "Brake with the heel of your skate!, not the toes!" Needless to say, from then on--
    537888|00000000||Heard about my time ice skating with Ciri?
    537822|00000000||Pinching's apparently effective.
    537824|00000000||Mh. Later perhaps. For now, talk to me. Tell me a story.
    535070|00000000||Hey… Yen… You're dozing off.
    537885|00000000||No. Just… resting my eyes.
    537887|00000000||Yeah, it's called sleeping.
    537820|00000000||Then do something to keep me awake.
    538466|00000000||I'm lousy with food…
    538468|00000000||I'm not great with food…
    538470|00000000||I know that all too well. When we lived in Aedd Gynvael, you tried to make soft-boiled eggs once. Forgot to add water.
    538472|00000000||Got lost in thought…
    538474|00000000||More like distracted. By me.
    538476|00000000||Mhm… Still got that nightdress?
    538478|00000000||Geralt… We've drifted off the topic at hand. I'm hungry. So hungry I don't care how badly you cook.
   1056920|00000000||The good old days, you might say… Ah, but no matter. I'm hungry. So much so that I care not a lick for how poorly you cook.
    535320|00000000||Ugh. I can't believe we're doing this.
    535075|00000000||Wiping vomit off the floor?
    535079|00000000||No. The Trial.
    538361|00000000||If that's Ciri in there… she could come outta this crippled, wrong in the head, just emotionless. Thought about that?
    538408|00000000||Course I have. Thing is, we don't have a choice.
    538410|00000000||Not any more, we don't. But… we rushed it. Should've started by--
    538363|00000000||Don't have a choice.
    538362|00000000||Yen knows what she's doing.
    538404|00000000||I trust Yen. She knows what she's doing.
    538406|00000000||Don't doubt that. But do we know what she's doing? She tell you how likely this is to work?
    538412|00000000||Gentlemen, the floor's as clean as it'll ever be, and I need to be wiped down as well.
   1060170|00000000||Geralt… Maybe you oughta…?
   1056918|00000000||Come now, Eskel. I shan't bite you. Just do it.
    538415|00000000||No offense, but I'd rather Geralt did it.
    538417|00000000||Understood. I'd prefer that, too.
    538486|00000000||Ummmma…
    538420|00000000||That normal?
    538422|00000000||Yes. Uma's body is disintegrating from the inside. Once that's complete, we'll need to reform it… or he'll die.
    538459|00000000||You witchers were given mutagens. We will use spells.
    538462|00000000||Brought some food.
   1059218|00000000||Good, I'm famished. Would…?
   1059221|00000000||Vesemir, would you mind preparing something for me?
   1059223|00000000||Something, sure… Just don't expect pate and crumpets… More likely to get bean and tomato stew… Or--
   1059225|00000000||Whatever. So long as it's warm. And there's a lot of it.
    538464|00000000||Good, I'm famished… Geralt… I cannot leave his side… Would you prepare me something?
    538465|00000000||What would you like?
    538483|00000000||All right. Anything in particular strike your fancy?
    538484|00000000||Something light. Scrambled eggs, perhaps? Or an omelet if you wish to spoil me. With onions, mushrooms and peppers.
    538489|00000000||Thanks.
    532277|00000000||Mhm. Take it you had a productive evening?
    532279|00000000||Yes. We talked about Uma. Till late.
    532281|00000000||So I guess you didn't get a chance to see to the beams in the tower?
    532283|00000000||Uh… No… But we'll, uh, get to that, I promise. Right, Lambert?
    519681|00000000||Method didn't work, Vesemir?
    519694|00000000||Guess your gravestone and hemlock method didn't work…
    519703|00000000||Not entirely. But I did learn something.
    537428|00000000||Right, so what now?
    537430|00000000||We can begin. We need only brew the potions.
    537432|00000000||Wait. Why couldn't we--
    537434|00000000||Do it earlier? Because the preparatory potions for the Trial are strongly reactive. They must be administered immediately after they're brewed. Satisfied?
    537436|00000000||Geralt, make the potions. Here are the formulae. Eskel, take a bottle of spirit…
    537438|00000000||Oh no. After last night, I--
    537440|00000000||…and disinfect the tools. Well? Chop-chop!
    537335|00000000||What now?
    537336|00000000||Thought that table was long gone.
    537442|00000000||Thought we got rid of that table ages ago.
    537444|00000000||Huh. Must be fifty years since I last saw Sad Albert.
    537446|00000000||Couldn't bear to part with it. Thought we might find a use for it one day. You know how old people are.
    537448|00000000||Sure. Every grandpa out there's got an attic full of torture devices.
    532305|00000000||While you were out hunting forktails and playing with the megascope, I examined Uma. Noticed one thing - at moments of, what's the term… relaxed consciousness, he behaves differently.
    532309|00000000||While falling asleep, he'd pause awake for an instant. Something different about his movements, his gaze, then. But only for a moment.
    532310|00000000||So I induced a trance, hypnotized him, essentially. No effect at first, but as he dropped into deep lethargy, I heard something… a sigh or a moan. And it wasn't Uma's voice.
    532431|00000000||All right. I just don't get how that helps us.
    532433|00000000||Then keep silent. Thank you, Vesemir… And… I apologize for what I said earlier. Have the boys told you what we plan to do?
    532435|00000000||Yes. Don't like it one bit. But I suppose I have to trust you.
    519690|00000000||Vesemir, learn anything?
    519680|00000000||Vesemir, you learn anything?
    532285|00000000||You can give the boys a rap on their knuckles later. Let's get to work.
    532271|00000000||Mhm. And reeking of booze.
    532273|00000000||That hat was a memento, Lambert.
    532275|00000000||Relax, old man. It'll come out in the wash.
    519512|00000000||See everyone's up and at 'em.
   1075881|00000000||Damn… What a dream.
    535230|00000000||[Administer Mother's Tears.]
    535232|00000000||[Administer Speargrass Sap.]
    537559|00000000||Aaaa… Aaaaach! Aaaaaaa!!!
    537618|00000000||Ummmmmmamama… UUUuuu… Umamama….
    537620|00000000||I had hoped… I'd hoped I would never have to watch this again.
    537622|00000000||Why'd you keep the table, then?
    537665|00000000||Geralt. Next potion.
   1059214|00000000||Eskel, I'm sorry… Would you mind…?
   1059216|00000000||Getting some rags? On it.
    535265|00000000||Ummmmamamamama… AAaaaaaa….. AAAAaaaach!
    535277|00000000||Oesi, caefyn!
    537758|00000000||What now?
    537760|00000000||Now we wait for the potions to do their work. Might take a day. Might take more.
    537763|00000000||You need only wait, true. But I must maintain the stabilizing spell. Uma's body is not nearly as resilient as a young candidate witcher's. Without this he'd--
   1056916|00000000||Bueeeeergh…
    537561|00000000||Yyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaa!!!
    537625|00000000||Listen… We should stop this.
    537627|00000000||Then Uma dies. Very painfully.
    537629|00000000||Yennefer's right.
    537631|00000000||Open the next valve.
    537592|00000000||Stop. This is a bad idea.
    535231|00000000||[Administer Wildrye Juice.]
    535233|00000000||Aaaach… Aaaaaach!
    537594|00000000||Aaaa…. Aaaa…. Ummmmmmamamamaaaaa…
    537596|00000000||The hookweed work?
    537598|00000000||If it hadn't, the pain would've sent him into shock, killed him.
    537661|00000000||So, everything's going smoothly.
    537663|00000000||No… But it's within known norms.
    537601|00000000||Administer the next potion.
    535169|00000000||Potions ready.
    535170|00000000||Tools, too.
    535171|00000000||Good. Vesemir…
    535172|00000000||Hookweed extract to deaden the pain. I know. Done this before.
    535175|00000000||Eskel, make the incisions in his veins, insert the tubes. Geralt, place the potion vials in the feeders.
   1056911|00000000||Umauma!
    537508|00000000||Ready.
    535180|00000000||Open the valves. It doesn't matter in which order.
    537766|00000000||Geralt… I'm sorry, could you…?
    537768|00000000||Clean that up? Of course.
    526021|00000000||Not about to ask for anything. I'm telling you. You can try to stop me.
    571955|00000000||Gotta ask the baron's permission. Thing is, he ain't 'ere.
    571957|00000000||But then I'll bring your enlightened reign to an end, an abrupt and premature end.
   1059030|00000000||Think you got me shakin' in my boots?
   1059033|00000000||You sure as hell should be.
    571961|00000000||Fine. Cripple's not worth no blood. See the groom. He oughta be glad to give 'im up, bugger's been eatin' from the feedbags. And a pleasant journey to you both.
    571963|00000000||Thank you kindly.
    571959|00000000||But that'd be an error. A mortal one.
    571952|00000000||Believe you meant to say you've come to ask my permission to take 'im. I am in charge now, so…
    571954|00000000||Uma - gonna take him with me.
    526012|00000000||Uma - I'm here to take him away.
    526015|00000000||Never mind. We'll talk later.
    526013|00000000||I'll come back later.
    525898|00000000||Need to talk to you.
    525899|00000000||About?
   1059206|00000000||Right. Let's get back.
   1059208|00000000||After you, sir.
   1059186|00000000||Right. Back to the fortress.
   1059210|00000000||You go ahead. Gonna stay here a bit.
   1059212|00000000||Mhm. Not too long, though. Remember, got ourselves a cripple to cure.
   1059187|00000000||Go. Gonna stay here a bit.
   1059228|00000000||Witchrses sharp backclubs takes. And home goes.
   1059831|00000000||Mhm. Don't worry, I don't need convincing. Come on, Geralt, let's go.
    527137|00000000||De ole hen she cackled, she cackled on de fence… de ole hen she cackled, an she ain't cackled sence.
    527138|00000000||What's that song?
    528032|00000000||Some old hill-folk tune, perfect for hiking… My mom sang it to me.
    528034|00000000||You remember her?
    528035|00000000||Just that silly song. Nothing else.
    527140|00000000||Not scared to leave the horse down below? Forktail could decide to have at him…
    528042|00000000||Bah… Scorpion's a war horse, a purebred Kaedweni. He'll be fine. Have I told you how I got him?
    528100|00000000||No… don't think so.
    528102|00000000||Saved this lost knight once… You know, woods, dark, wolves. The standard.
    528104|00000000||Told him, "Give me what you find at home" and all that… No kid this time, but his mare had just foaled.
    528106|00000000||Eskel and Scorpion… Bound by fate. An enchanting tale.
    528108|00000000||Mock me all you want. You're just jealous.
    512156|00000000||Not really a challenge, 'cause I could beat you riding a lame sow… But why not.
    512157|00000000||You're a lame sow yourself.
    533870|00000000||First to Kaer Morhen wins!
    512154|00000000||Gladly.
    512158|00000000||We shouldn't. Rather not tire out my horse for no reason.
    512159|00000000||Ah… Honestly can't see what all those dames see in you. You're a stick in the mud.
    533872|00000000||Pretty damn handsome stick, though.
    533874|00000000||Debatable… Let's go.
    512155|00000000||We shouldn't.
    512153|00000000||Hey! Whaddaya say to a little race? Maybe see who's faster - Roach or Scorpion. And who's the better rider.
    565422|00000000||I'm taking Uma.
    568992|00000000||There ain't a--
    565467|00000000||Sergeant Ardal said I could.
    565466|00000000||Got the baron's permission.
    565468|00000000||Bring 'im back, though, won't you? Be awful dull without 'im.
    378703|00000000||Find some other diversion.
    378731|00000000||Find something else to laugh at. I dunno, catch some frogs and shove straws up their asses…?
    378733|00000000||Huh. That one of your witcher games?
    379567|00000000||Witcher version's different. Don't make me show you.
   1075413|00000000||Open the door. Now.
    378715|00000000||No. Not about to bring him back.
    378701|00000000||Out of my way.
    332382|00365006||Bandit
   1064467|00000000||Forgotten already? An omelet with peppers, mushroom and onion. Thank you.
   1056926|00000000||Not quite what I asked for… But it looks appetizing enough.
    538508|00000000||Oh, decided to put in the effort… Thank you.
    538510|00000000||I get a gratuity for that?
    538512|00000000||Later, perhaps…
   1056922|00000000||What… What is this?
   1056924|00000000||My own original recipe… It ain't prety, but it's edible. I think.
    538547|00000000||So, uh… do I… spoon-feed you?
    538549|00000000||Would you prefer to watch me eat without my hands? You could find it amusing, I suppose.
    538551|00000000||Right… One for papa Vesemir…
    538545|00000000||I'm supposed to feed you?
    538553|00000000||Living the life…
    538555|00000000||Everyone's at your beck and call. Got me cooking for you, turned Vesemir into your errand boy…
    538557|00000000||I'd gladly trade places with any of you. If you think--
    538559|00000000||Relax. I was kidding.
    538561|00000000||Geralt… I'm exhausted, hungry and upset. In other words, please let's leave the laughter for later.
    538518|00000000||Umm…. Umma… Umma…
    538520|00000000||What's wrong with him?
    538537|00000000||A fever. I'll break it with a spell.
    538539|00000000||A cold compress should do the trick. I'll take care of it. You eat.
    538544|00000000||Thanks. Geralt…? I'm waiting.
    538514|00000000||Scrambled eggs, after all.
    538516|00000000||Sorry… didn't feel up to any real cooking.
    530850|00000000||Something tells me he's not gonna like this…
    530852|00000000||Bones… Pulverized.
    530853|00000000||Mhm. Old Speartip's never been kind to guests.
    530854|00000000||Get ready… He's coming.
    530855|00000000||You miss me, whoreson?
   1058917|00000000||Ah, so soft and sweet, just sleepin' there… Makes you wanna make this moment last forever…
   1058921|00000000||Just lost the element of surprise.
   1058923|00000000||Couldn't care less. I'm up for the challenge.
   1058919|00000000||We need to be quiet… I could do without a warm welcome from Old Speartip.
    530848|00000000||Hear that?
    531012|00000000||Mhm. Old Speartip's looking for us already.
    526007|00000000||Was q103 (finding Baron's family) the last quest I completed, and thus I have already seen Uma?
    526008|00000000||Yes. I've completed q103.
   1056476|00000000||No.
   1056475|00000000||Yes.
   1061709|00000000||Enough!
    526029|00000000||Enough!
    526009|00000000||No.
   1061706|00000000||Have I completed q107 (rescuing Anna from the swamps) and is the baron dead?
   1061708|00000000||No. The baron is still alive.
   1061707|00000000||Yes. The baron is dead.
   1056474|00000000||Did I do sq202 (hunting genie with Yen) and tell Yennefer I wanted to be with her?
    515891|00000000||Supposed to be forktail bait! Guess it works for witchers as well!
    515592|00000000||Didn't tie itself to this stake…
   1061767|00000000||Aaaaaaaaargh!!!!
    514684|00000000||Uhhh. Looks like we got company. Nilfgaardian battle mounts.
   1032319|00000000||What do you want?
    514690|00000000||The emperor's displeased with you.
    514687|00000000||Then he oughta ask somebody else for help.
    514686|00000000||The emperor does not ask - anyone for anything. You will ride with us to Vizima.
    514688|00000000||Sure about that?
    514689|00000000||Don't even try.
    514692|00000000||Fine. Lead the way.
    530069|00000000||Lambert… You're a genius!
    532690|00000000||Course I am! So? We inviting the Lodge to our bash?
    532694|00000000||Fuck yeah! Summon the bitches!
    530067|00000000||You're a genius!
    530070|00000000||Lambert… Believe you've had your last drink.
    532697|00000000||You're just jealous you didn't think of it first… But is that any reason to spoil it for us?
    532699|00000000||I don't have the strength to argue.
    532701|00000000||Course you don't, cream puff. Bet I could take you with one finger.
    532703|00000000||Hey… Relax, Lambert…
    532705|00000000||Wanna fight? Huh? Wanna? C'mon!
    532707|00000000||Good night.
    530068|00000000||Think you've had your last drink.
    530066|00000000||Hellooo, Eskel! Wake up!
    532663|00000000||Hm? What? What happened?
    532665|00000000||Got sloshed, stewed and fifty-seven other varieties of drunk - that's what happened. Get up, time to have a drink.
    532667|00000000||Le' me alone… Gonna puke… The three of us get together, always ends like this…
    532669|00000000||Let's find a fourth! Better! A woman!
    532671|00000000||None here but Yen… And we don't wanna wake her up. Believe me.
    532673|00000000||What about that sorceress you talked to? Think about it. We turn on the megascope, cordially invite her… she teleports here… maybe brings some friends! How's that sound?
    535511|00000000||With his ever faithful Lil' Bleater!
    535509|00000000||Heeeey… Look… Here he is!
   1043810|00000000||Cozy troll abode. Long as I'm here, might as well look around.
   1043851|00000000||Guess our friendly troll detests drowners.
   1043849|00000000||Clear the troll laid a loving hand to this drowner.
   1047959|00000000||A letter…? Troll looked to be pretty good with his hands, but I'd never suspect he could write.
   1047862|00000000||Notes, Salamandra seal… Must be from the time they attacked Kaer Morhen.
   1047871|00000000||Plan of attack for the fortress… Not how I remember it… Troll must've nabbed the owner of these before he could reach the fortress.
   1047961|00000000||Seems we owe this troll a lot.
   1028723|00000000||Is that a sword or an eggbeater? Strike from the wrist, not your elbow! Again!
   1029043|00000000||You walked away from practice without my permission. You know that… Do not stop! Bleeding is no excuse!
   1029044|00000000||Now take off that bandage and get back to your training. You'll see to your wound when I say you're done!
   1029049|00000000||What's that supposed to be?! Swaying side to side like a reed in the wind! Head up! Guard up! Faster, faster!
   1029073|00000000||A witcher usually fights with a sword, silver or steel. But he must know how to use all weapons. Battleaxes! Picks! Slingshots!
   1029074|00000000||Archery training today. Miss the target, you owe me fifty push-ups. Hit it, you owe me twenty. Now move!
   1029262|00000000||A horn…? Something's happening. You're to hide, wait till I come back!
   1029263|00000000||Yes, I know you've trained with swords. But you're still shit with them. I want you behind those rocks. And keep your mouths shut.
    526974|00000000||Pulse weak… but regular…
    526976|00000000||Look at the fire… Now look here…
    526978|00000000||Pupils functioning normally…
    526980|00000000||Ummmmamama.
    526982|00000000||Hold this.
    526984|00000000||Umamamma.
    526986|00000000||No reaction to dimeritium.
    526136|00000000||Look. Like that? Pretty, isn't it?
    526138|00000000||Ummmmamamama…
    526139|00000000||Interesting… Not afraid of silver.
    533948|00000000||Whoa… She's really not in the mood.
    528835|00000000||Lemme talk, all right?
    530317|00000000||I'm talking. Fact is you know as much about negotiating as they do about grammar.
    530319|00000000||We're not here to hurt you. We don't wanna touch your rocks. Just let us pass.
   1059766|00000000||Witcher say hurt no. But before at troll hit! So hit hard big ouch! Spot!
   1059768|00000000||Before throws too trolls. Trolls throws first, witchrses hit then!
   1059770|00000000||Witchrses throws on trolls - ouch… Trolls on witcherses throws - ouch. Ouch here, ouch there…
    530444|00000000||Troll rock throw… Witcherses strike no back. Just talkie-talkie. Witcher… good?
    530446|00000000||Dummy you. Witcherses monster kills. Trolls monsters… Yes, true is, no face make!
    530448|00000000||Hmmm… We do go this. Yous sharp backclubs leave here, yous pass. No agrees - we smash.
    530462|00000000||All right. We'll leave our swords here. Pick 'em up on the way back.
    530464|00000000||We them want no.
    530466|00000000||Ick metal. Mouth stings.
    530468|00000000||You nuts?!
    530470|00000000||Shut up and follow my lead.
    530449|00000000||We'll leave our swords. Come back for them later.
    530450|00000000||Not gonna happen.
    530472|00000000||No way. Witcher without his sword - it'd be like losing an arm.
    530474|00000000||Better arm lose than head!
    530309|00000000||Yeah. Gonna have to agree to disagree.
    530311|00000000||Finally. My brain's gonna ooze out my ears if I have to listen to this bullshit any longer.
    530313|00000000||All right, calcites and dolomites. Who wants to taste some witchers' silver?
    530315|00000000||I itsay. No should trusty witcherses!
    528834|00000000||Right… We've talked enough.
    528831|00000000||We rocks throws - yous goes no farmore. Witcherses understanded?
    528832|00000000||We understanded. But we still gotta get to the Circle of Elements.
    528833|00000000||Listen, Butwe. Trolls come no to witchersy castle.
    530216|00000000||Rock lots there. Pretty rock.
    530218|00000000||Enjoying this little chat? 'Cause, er, it's not getting us anywhere.
    532744|00000000||Stop whining, Eskel. Times you gotta squeeze into some fr-fr-fr….
    583656|00000000||Frippery.
    532746|00000000||Uuugh… We don't tell a soul, understand? This stays here.
    532741|00000000||We're squeezing into those dresses.
    532757|00000000||Now… I'll do the talking, you two fiddle with the crystals.
    532759|00000000||Cáed'mil, bloede dh'oine… Hocus-pocus… Abracadabra… Arse blathanna…
    532762|00000000||What is this…? Who's that?
    532764|00000000||So sorry… We were never here.
    532766|00000000||Guaaaaards!!!
    532768|00000000||More paper, Excellency?
    539012|00000000||Damn, Eskel… You got an hourglass figure…
    539014|00000000||And you're an ass. C'mon, go, thing's tight as hell.
    532772|00000000||No, you oaf! Witchers! Witchers attacking!
   1056903|00000000||Hahahahaha!
   1056905|00000000||Hahhahaha!
    532775|00000000||I trust you have an explanation for this. A very good one.
    536552|00000000||Go to bed. Now.
    532770|00000000||No, you oaf! The Lodge! The Lodge has come for me!
    532753|00000000||Don't really like the idea, either…
    532755|00000000||Fine… But if this Ida refuses to talk to us, it'll be your fault.
    532742|00000000||Don't like the idea, either.
    529982|00000000||All right… how's this work?
    529983|00000000||Well… A twist here, a turn there… Then you gotta say something in Elvish.
    529985|00000000||Easy-peasy. Let's do it.
    529986|00000000||Hey. Hang on. When this… Ida sees us… we'll scare her off. I mean, we don't look anything like sorceresseswes…
    532644|00000000||I know! Yennefer's clothes! Let's dress up. Bags're over there.
    532738|00000000||What's this thing you got for dressing up?
    532740|00000000||Shut it, wiseass, or I'll lace your corset up so tight you'll shit in your bloomers.
   1051747|00000000||Let me be!
   1051749|00000000||No… No!!!
   1051745|00000000||Help me!!!
    166560|afd61d5d||Stablemaster
    530432|00000000||The Circle, let's go.
    530757|00000000||Yeah, let's… But try not to get distracted this time, all right?
    530430|00000000||Let's go to the Circle.
    530759|00000000||I need more time.
    530761|00000000||Not like I have a choice… So, yeah, fine.
    530431|00000000||Gimme a minute more.
    530763|00000000||Well, well. Decided to come back.
    569290|05f7bcd0||Ifrit
    530323|00000000||Axii saved your life? How?
    530333|00000000||Sense a good story coming…
    530335|00000000||One of the best. A couple of road robbers stopped me - one pointed a crossbow at me and the other started rummaging through my satchel.
    530337|00000000||Made the man with the crossbow shoot his friend… then hang himself.
    530345|00000000||Wow… truly great story.
    530347|00000000||Isn't it? Real side-splitter, I think.
    530339|00000000||Yeah. Great story.
    530338|00000000||Didn't have to kill them.
    530341|00000000||Didn't have to kill them…
    530343|00000000||But I could, so I did. Two whoresons less in the world. Big deal.
    531209|00000000||We all went through it…
    531215|00000000||We all went through it…
    531217|00000000||That's just it - not everyone made it. Lots of boys died here. Boys taken against their will.
    529603|00000000||Let's go.
    529611|00000000||Know what… Let's get outta here.
    529613|00000000||Don't like what you're hearin', huh? Witchers shouldn't talk like that.
    529615|00000000||Know what else you won't like? After the Trial of the Medallion, I rode straight home. To thank my daddy for everything. Wanna hear what I did to him?
    529617|00000000||Lambert… Please.
    529619|00000000||Thought we were opening up, having an honest talk… But fine, let's continue pretending everything's just peachy.
    529621|00000000||The road beckons, my good man! Our companions await!
   1059646|00000000||Need to get our swords. Witcher with no sword's like a man without an arm.
   1060316|00000000||Sure thing, brother.
    529605|00000000||Didn't know… I'm sorry.
    529609|00000000||Next time you wonder why I'm so bitter… well, there's your answer.
   1059204|00000000||All right. We've griped enough. Let's get out of here.
    529602|00000000||Didn't know… Sorry.
    529593|00000000||It was our destiny…
    529595|00000000||Destiny? Let me tell you about destiny.
    529597|00000000||My dad was a drunk. He'd knock a few back, then beat me and Mom bloody. We prayed for his death, every night.
    529599|00000000||One day our prayers were almost answered. Dad lost his way coming home from the tavern, walked smack into a nest of nekkers… But some witcher saved him. Know what he wanted in return?
    529601|00000000||"Give me the first thing you see when you get home." My life… For the life of that prick? I say fuck that kinda destiny.
    531211|00000000||Think it's that bad being a witcher?
    531213|00000000||Guess I could've been someone worse… Just a shame I had no choice.
    531178|00000000||Hate being a witcher that badly?
    531167|00000000||Tell me… You always been such a cynical bastard?
    531169|00000000||No. I was adorable before Vesemir brought me to Kaer Morhen.
    530325|00000000||Yeah, Axii's useful… and dangerous.
    530327|00000000||Hmph. What makes you say that?
    530329|00000000||It tempts you to overuse it. Force a merchant to reduce his price, make an arrogant noble drink from the gutter, teach someone to show you respect… Can become hard to resist.
    530331|00000000||I don't. Life's too short.
    530322|00000000||Useful… and dangerous.
    528862|00000000||All right… Phylactery's in place.
    528863|00000000||Then all we gotta do is wait. The container'll absorb the Power of the elements… while we catch a breather.
    528865|00000000||Oof… So, how'd you deal with the trolls when you passed the Trial of the Medallion?
    531145|00000000||Lemme think… Oh yeah. Used Axii. But I only had to get past one troll. Other two were busy.
    531147|00000000||Yeah, useful sign, Axii. Saved my life a short while ago.
    531743|00000000||Let's get outta here.
    531963|00000000||Lambert doesn't know shit about megascopes.
    531969|00000000||You know… Lambert's not exactly an expert on megascopes, so--
    531971|00000000||Please. Lambert is mean, not stupid.
   1075249|00000000||But no matter… More importantly, I shall finally be able to contact Ida.
   1075251|00000000||The Ida? Elven Sage? What do you want from her?
   1075253|00000000||Stay and you'll learn for yourself.
   1075255|00000000||Members of the Lodge don't let just anyone in on their secrets… or so I've heard.
    517507|00000000||Hey, Ida.
    517531|00000000||Hey there, Ida.
    517550|00000000||Geralt…
    531991|00000000||It matters not, Yennefer. I've grown accustomed to human… decorum.
    532058|00000000||What's the problem?
    532064|00000000||What is it?
    532128|00000000||Not gonna happen.
    532226|00000000||Don't really see why I should apologize. I know sorceresses expect me to bow down before them…
    532228|00000000||So you refuse to bow and thumb your nose at them instead. Very mature.
    532234|00000000||All is ready. We should gather the others and begin.
    532232|00000000||Finish whatever it was you and the boys were planning to do… Then we'll begin.
    532230|00000000||Ugh. Oh, enough.
    532130|00000000||I'm sorry. It's just, when Ida started in with that patronizing tone--
    532131|00000000||You decided to prove she was completely justified to adopt that attitude? Well done, Geralt. Bravo.
    532127|00000000||Sorry.
    532126|00000000||You can start by apologizing for acting like a boor. Despite my asking you not to.
    532124|00000000||All in all, interesting conversation. What now?
    532096|00000000||What now?
    532235|00000000||Any idea what she was talking about?
    545977|00000000||Ciri, of course.
    545979|00000000||Wish everyone'd just leave her the hell alone.
    545981|00000000||Wouldn't count on it.
    532097|00000000||You understand that?
    532098|00000000||The Migration - what was that about?
    532211|00000000||What was that about… the Migration?
    532213|00000000||Good gods! Did they teach you no history here?
    532215|00000000||No. Vesemir figured sword work'd be more useful on the Path. Gonna answer me?
    532217|00000000||Naturally. One's never too old to learn.
    532219|00000000||The Aen Seidhe and the Aen Elle elves were once one folk, the Aen Undod. Then came a cataclysm, no one knows its nature. The Aen Undod were forced to leave their world. They split along the way.
    532221|00000000||So if Uma's curse was uttered in this Laith aen Undod…
    532223|00000000||Then it's old. Very, very old.
    532088|00000000||The Time of the White Frost and White Light is nigh…
    545970|00000000||… and the world will perish amidst ice. I know Ithlinne's prophecy.
    532095|00000000||I don't doubt you know it. But do you understand it?
    545973|00000000||The Elder Blood can initiate the Final Age, the Time of the End… or stop it. Remember this, Gwynbleidd. For you will be the one to determine if the seed bursts into flames.
    532060|00000000||Lemme guess… you want something in return.
    532062|00000000||If I may, Gwynbleidd, I'd like to request - stop guessing. Just listen.
    532057|00000000||Guessing you want something in return.
    532038|00000000||Take it you've heard the words before.
    532040|00000000||Yes… In legends. Of the kind that do not end happily.
    532042|00000000||Can you help us… with the curse?
    532044|00000000||To a degree. Agnes de Glanville's incantation combined with Eldar's Triangle - inverted, of course - they are your only possible recourse. But I cannot guarantee that even they will suffice.
    545965|00000000||Thank you, Aen Saevherne. Va fail.
    545967|00000000||That does not conclude our conversation.
    532009|00000000||Heard the words before, haven't you?
    532036|00000000||Know the dialect?
    532046|00000000||Recognize the dialect?
    532048|00000000||Laith aen Undod.
    532050|00000000||Meaning?
    532052|00000000||The so-called One Speech… A forgotten language dating from before the Migration.
    532054|00000000||The Migration?
    532056|00000000||Later, Geralt.
    517579|00000000||Why have you summoned me?
    517594|00000000||We've come up against a curse, one we must lift. It was uttered in a dialect of Elder Speech unfamiliar to me.
    517596|00000000||I see… The words of the curse?
    517601|00000000||Va fail, elaine - cáed'mil, folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus.
    517520|00000000||Ceádmil, Aen Saevherne.
    517506|00000000||Cáed'mil, Aen Saevherne.
    531977|00000000||Consider it a token of our trust. Now, let's begin. And, Geralt, behave - please?
    531979|00000000||Didn't you just say you trust me?
    531981|00000000||Stop twisting my words.
    531984|00000000||Cáed'mil, Yennefer aep Vengerberg. Gwynbleidd.
    531973|00000000||Enough. Ready for this conversation?
    531975|00000000||Sure you want me here? Members of the Lodge don't let just anyone in on their secrets… or so I've heard.
    531965|00000000||No, he probably knew… But that's the sort of prank you only pull on someone you like.
    531967|00000000||You don't suppose he--? Lambert? Really? I'm flattered.
    531962|00000000||Pulling your ponytail, I suppose.
    511894|00000000||Thank you. Seems to be working now. What was it?
    531959|00000000||Dimeritium bombs. Lambert left them by the beds.
    531961|00000000||Mhm. I suppose he had no idea they could interfere with my megascope?
    537072|00000000||Ugh… I could eat a horse, hooves and all… Then eat what was left in its feedbag…
    537028|00000000||You don't know who's trapped in Uma's body. How did you figure the proportions?
    538005|00000000||Performed a series of complex calculations… Extrapolated some data… Ran simulations…
    538007|00000000||Meaning you guessed?
    538009|00000000||Mhm.
    450386|00000000||What happened then?
    450388|00000000||Told him to keep his distance, 'cause soft and supple as that samovila's bosom might be, she's still a monster.
    527071|00000000||Bleeding heavily…
    528472|00000000||From an artery - blood's light-colored. Can't fly much further.
    527072|00000000||Fled to its lair, looks like.
    527073|00000000||Good. Means it's done fleeing, gonna make a stand.
    527070|00000000||Landed here…
    528470|00000000||Not very gracefully, look at the tracks. We broke its wing, I think.
