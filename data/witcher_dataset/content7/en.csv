    575260|00000000||Rather see to it myself.
    575770|00000000||I doubt that. Can't compare the Wild Hunt to Temerian shield bearers or Lyrian archers.
    575219|00000000||Facing it here would put Vizima at risk. Hundreds of innocents could die.
    575777|00000000||Kaer Morhen is in a wilderness. And your army stands to be far more helpful there.
    575778|00000000||Hmm… Agreed. I shall send a banner with you. On one condition - General Voorhis will lead it.
    575780|00000000||Can't agree to that.
    575820|00000000||And I cannot agree to witchers commanding my troops.
    575821|00000000||Well, I'm not about to give in - you don't look it, either.
    575826|00000000||Sorry to take up your time, Your Majesty.
    575839|00000000||Bring me Ciri.
    575841|00000000||I will. If that's what she wants.
    575679|00000000||I don't doubt it - against conventional foes. The Wild Hunt's different.
    575259|00000000||Don't doubt it.
   1062496|00000000||Your Imperial Majesty.
   1062499|00000000||Witcher. Why have you come?
    554325|00000000||I've managed to find out where Ciri is.
    575193|00000000||Finally. I had begun to doubt the wisdom of enlisting you. Bring her here at once.
    575194|00000000||The Wild Hunt's pursuing her. Kaer Morhen's the only place she'll be safe.
    554326|00000000||That was not a suggestion. I can defend my own daughter.
    446004|00000000||Something surprised them. Didn't stand much of a chance.
    446006|00000000||Prints're deep… Must be something big.
   1060566|00000000||Firefly's stopped at the hut. Oughta look inside.
    446002|00000000||Body's still warm, blood hasn't even dried…
    559458|05cea138||Fiend
   1058289|0a09c08e||Bilge Hag
    560503|00000000||Couldn't find anyone else. Gaspard claims they're dead.
    560548|00000000||Why are you sorry?
    581386|00000000||What do you mean?
    554320|00000000||She's cold. Spirit's left her.
    554321|00000000||Must've passed shortly before we found her.
    581369|00000000||Let's wait by the boat.
    584305|00000000||She's cold, spirit's left her. Nothin' we could do.
    584307|00000000||Let's wait by the boat.
    560549|00000000||Step aside.
    560547|00000000||Step aside.
    560553|00000000||Argh. Everything's gone wrong. What'll we do now?
    560554|00000000||Got a boat, you can leave with me. But I need to find someone first.
    560555|00000000||An ashen-haired lass?
    581382|00000000||Yes.
    581384|00000000||Oh - dreadful sorry.
    560504|00000000||Thanks for helpin'. And, uh, sorry I didn't trust ye.
    560501|00000000||Saw another fall from a cliff. Broke his neck.
    560502|00000000||Shit. Rabenick told me to have an eye on the snot. 'Twas his nephew.
    560488|00000000||Found one near a monster's den. He was already dead, sadly.
    554315|00000000||Gaspard! Hah! You seem a bit muddled.
    560411|00000000||Beh, err, muddled. A bit drowsy, that's all.
    560412|00000000||What of the others?
    560302|00000000||Your friends asked me to find you, Ferenc and Ivo.
    560303|00000000||I'm afeared they're dead. Some horrors swarmed Ivo, saw it with my own eyes. And Ferenc… I heard him - a blood-curdling cry, then the roar of a beast.
    560304|00000000||Let's get back to the hut. I'll protect you along the way.
    560305|00000000||Shame about the lads, really, but what can ye do…? Come on.
    584233|00000000||But, I should warn you, I suffer from narcolepsy, meaning-- Oah…
    560306|00000000||I know what it means. Don't worry, I'll keep you awake.
    576082|00000000||Off we go, then.
    560277|00000000||Your friends told me to find you.
    560300|00000000||Any chance you've seen an ashen-haired woman around here?
    560301|00000000||Here? Nay, not a soul.
    575966|00000000||But… a lot passes me by on account of my sleepin'.
    560276|00000000||Looking for an ashen-haired young woman.
    560311|00000000||Wanna explore the island a bit. Come back for you after, take you to your friends. Unless you care to come with me now?
    560312|00000000||I'd only be a burden. You know, the narcolepsy…
    576086|00000000||This place seems safe enough. Just be sure and come back. And make it quick, eh? Not that much to see here.
   1062217|00000000||Wanna explore the island a bit. Come back and get you later.
    560275|00000000||You and your friends - who are you, exactly?
    560296|00000000||You and your friends - what's your story?
    560297|00000000||Rabenick and Company. Real estate appraisal, insurance, mass event organization.
    560298|00000000||Gaspard Sutter - my mates call me Sleepy.
    575985|00000000||I even slept through that storm.
    584230|00000000||It's a shame so many died…
    560254|00000000||Hey, wake up.
    560255|00000000||Shoo… Back to bed, Nibbles.
    560256|00000000||Wake up!
    560257|00000000||Wha-- What's happenin'?
    575945|00000000||Who-- Who're you?
    560258|00000000||I'm Geralt.
    560313|00000000||What now?
    560203|00000000||Hm. Wonder how he wound up here.
   1075759|00000000||Tried to flee the fiend. Tsk. Stubby legs, too slow.
    560202|00000000||One of the missing dwarves. Shame he's dead.
    560213|00000000||Come down!
    560218|00000000||Right! I'm comin'!
    576155|00000000||You lucky devil, you.
    560230|00000000||You know, I've one regret - that--
    584217|00000000||Aaaargh!
    560232|00000000||Dead.
    560233|00000000||Damn.
    560212|00000000||I talked to your friends! Come down!
    560208|00000000||A man! Hah! Am I ever pleased to see you!
    582064|00000000||I'm here! Up here!
    582066|00000000||Hear me?! Up here!
   1062052|00000000||I know your story. Tell me how you wound up here.
   1062057|00000000||How'd you wind up here? What happened?
   1062059|00000000||Last I remember, I was on the Skellige shore, arguing with Avallac'h. He wanted to take me somewhere safe.
   1062061|00000000||After that, nothing but dreams.
    580354|00000000||I know the rest.
    580522|00000000||I know the rest.
    580385|00000000||I know the rest.
   1062535|00000000||I know the rest.
    580636|00000000||Hmm… Think I know the rest.
    580639|00000000||We should get going.
    580547|00000000||Let's go, time to leave.
    580608|00000000||Not this time.
    580610|00000000||C'mon, got a long road ahead of us. Let's go.
    554286|00000000||We need to go. The Wild Hunt can find us.
    580615|00000000||Waiting at Kaer Morhen with the others.
    580622|00000000||You lifted the curse?
    580624|00000000||Yeah, tell you on the way.
   1062053|00000000||We should go.
    580253|00000000||We need to go.
    584980|00000000||We should go.
    585026|00000000||We should go.
    580197|00000000||We gotta go.
    580650|00000000||We should go.
    586674|00000000||Damn…
    586676|00000000||Listen, we gotta think of a way to…
    586679|00000000||Get us outta here.
    586681|00000000||They'll know where we've gone, they'll know how to find me!
    586684|00000000||They already do.
    586688|00000000||Ciri, take us home.
    580612|00000000||Got a boat on the beach. Once we land, we'll head for Kaer Morhen. On horseback.
    580614|00000000||Right. Conventional means of travel. They're just better.
    585074|00000000||Though a portal would be quicker…
    585076|00000000||And draw Eredin to us immediately. Rather not risk it.
    585078|00000000||Besides, I hate portals.
    580550|00000000||I was afraid you were dead.
    580555|00000000||Found some dwarves here. Said they'd tried to wake you, but you were cold as ice, and you weren't breathing.
    580580|00000000||And yet you came in.
    580583|00000000||Who listens to dwarves these days?
    580588|00000000||Speaking of which - they're probably getting antsy. We should go.
    580546|00000000||I was afraid you were dead.
    585028|00000000||Recognize it? Know where it might be?
    585030|00000000||Not sure… I don't think so, but there was something familiar about it… and something terrifying.
    585031|00000000||The tower was stark and dead, but at the same time I felt I had to enter it.
    585035|00000000||Did you?
    585037|00000000||No, dreams all ended with me searching for the entrance.
    585038|00000000||And the last time, instead of the tower, I saw your grizzled face.
    585043|00000000||If not for the scar over your eye, I'd have thought I was still dreaming.
    585025|00000000||Recognize the place?
    584982|00000000||What did you dream? I've had nothing but nightmares lately, pretty horrible.
    585006|00000000||Likewise, for the most part. In one, a monster grown from a stillborn child chased you.
    585008|00000000||Ugh, that was horrible…
    585010|00000000||Had a few nice dreams. For example, in one we sat around a fire, drinking good wine, and all around people danced and laughed.
    585012|00000000||I like that one a lot better.
    585023|00000000||Me too. But these dreams, and the others, ended in some tower. No matter what I'd dream, in the end I would enter a tower…
    584979|00000000||What did you dream?
    584955|00000000||And that's when you landed back in Skellige.
    580497|00000000||The shore of Hindarsfjall - the first pleasant place that came to mind. Hjalmar and I used to swim there.
    580525|00000000||Wait, so... you actually wound up there by accident? I thought you and Avallac'h had arranged something.
    580527|00000000||No, he simply sensed me use my power. Just as Eredin can sense where I am, where I travel.
    580539|00000000||In fact, Eredin arrived soon after I did, his riders in tow…
    580541|00000000||Once again, things happened quickly: Lofoten, the Hunt's attack, my flight… And then… dreams, just dreams.
    580523|00000000||You did, and landed in Skellige.
    585045|00000000||You suspected right. Whoreson was not the ideal partner in crime.
    584945|00000000||Damned simpleton got it in his head that we'd cheated him and kidnapped Dudu.
    580476|00000000||Who you promptly freed only to have to flee to Temple Isle. Great idea.
    580487|00000000||We hadn't planned it, had no time to consider. We just bolted.
    580496|00000000||I didn't even realize the guardsmen were driving me into a trap. Suddenly, there I was - and I knew I had to disappear. At once.
   1062534|00000000||Junior cheated you in the end.
    580401|00000000||So how'd you even meet a man like Whoreson Junior?
   1062523|00000000||You and Yennefer were nowhere to be found. And I needed someone who could fix the phylactery.
    580446|00000000||No ordinary craftsman would do. I needed a mage, one with extraordinary powers.
   1062786|00000000||Dandelion took it upon himself to help me. It was as if his honor depended on it. He arranged a meeting with a mage, but it proved a trap set by the Temple Guard.
   1062788|00000000||Hm, failed to mention that.
   1062790|00000000||Eh, probably didn't want to worry you. Later we learned the Guard did that sort of thing regularly, in the hope of nabbing anyone who collaborated with mages.
   1062792|00000000||We needed to find another way. That was clear.
   1062525|00000000||Then Dandelion said he knew a man who owned a piece of Novigrad, as he put it, could do more than others. He was certain to know someone who could fix the phylactery.
   1062527|00000000||Whoreson Junior.
    580448|00000000||Mhm. I suspected it might not be the best idea, but I was desperate, had no choice.
    580386|00000000||How'd you meet Whoreson Junior?
    584814|00000000||But you failed to meet there…
    580369|00000000||Yes, we failed to. Once through the portal, instead of at Avallac'h's hideout, I landed right in the middle of Crookback Bog.
    580375|00000000||I barely escaped the Crones. And then there was the baron.
   1062585|00000000||You know he took me hunting? I killed a wild boar with my sword.
   1062587|00000000||I heard.
   1062589|00000000||A coincidence, really. I had no desire to hunt that day, but it felt wrong to refuse.
   1062595|00000000||I'd taken nothing remotely resembling a hunting weapon. I simply hadn't intended to hunt.
   1062597|00000000||I was wandering through the forest, breathing deep the air, and then I heard a strange sound, unsettling.
   1062599|00000000||Boar attacked you?
   1062601|00000000||Mhm. Big as a bison and lumbering straight at me. And all I had was my sword. Had to manage.
   1062603|00000000||Did just fine judging by how the baron's men remember it.
   1062772|00000000||Simple soldiers, the whole lot, but we got along splendidly. A shame I had to leave, flee, but I didn't want to bring the Wild Hunt down on them.
    580379|00000000||Apart from which, I knew by then the curse was progressing, so instead of looking for Avallac'h, I decided to find you and Yen.
    580365|00000000||I know, I followed your tracks.
    554304|00000000||We had agreed that if anything went wrong and we were separated, we would meet at his hideout in Velen.
   1062062|00000000||So tell me how it happened. Step by step.
   1056958|00000000||Eredin located us mere moments after we landed on Ard Skellig. Soon after, he and his riders surrounded us. I thought it was over, the end.
   1056962|00000000||Turned out Eredin had other plans. He produced the phylactery, uncorked it. A fog enveloped us, and Avallac'h began gasping for air.
   1056968|00000000||That's how Eredin cursed Avallac'h, triggered his transformation into Uma?
   1056966|00000000||Yes. He didn't wish to kill him. Humiliation, that's what he was after. But Avallac'h refused to succumb without a fight. He cast a spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks.
   1058674|00000000||And in a full half of a forest on Ard Skellig.
   1058676|00000000||Yet it also gave us time to flee. Avallac'h opened a portal, I leapt in. He was supposed to follow, right behind me, but something went awry. Impaired by the curse, he failed to reach the portal in time.
   1062042|00000000||Tell me everything - step by step.
    554299|00000000||So why'd you return?
    554300|00000000||I thought the Hunt had lost my scent for good. I thought I was safe.
   1062032|00000000||Besides, I… I wanted to find you, you and Yennefer.
    586669|00000000||You were looking for us, we were looking for you… Times I thought you were just a step away. Other times, felt like I was going around in circles…
   1062044|00000000||I'm not surprised. There were times I fled pell-mell head first and forward.
    580254|00000000||So why'd you return?
    580718|00000000||What was that world?
    580758|00000000||The world where Eredin couldn't find you, what was it like?
    580934|00000000||You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
    580936|00000000||Try me.
    580937|00000000||People there had metal in their heads, waged war from a distance, using things similar to megascopes.
    580938|00000000||And there were no horses, everyone had their own flying ship instead.
    580943|00000000||Ciri, stop fooling around.
    581004|00000000||Told you you wouldn't believe me.
    581008|00000000||Ah, we should've stayed there…
    580200|00000000||How'd you ever start traveling with Avallac'h?
    580209|00000000||As soon as I'd left you and Yen on the Isle of Avalon, I found myself pursued. Eredin and his Red Riders were on my heels.
    580210|00000000||I fled through many worlds, many times… They came very close to catching me, once. It was then that Avallac'h appeared, out of nowhere.
    580237|00000000||He found a portal and took us to a world where Eredin couldn't find us for… oh, perhaps half a year.
    580198|00000000||Your voyage with Avallac'h - how'd it start?
    584783|00000000||What's Eredin after? What's he want from you?
   1062006|00000000||What everyone wants - control of my powers.
    584779|00000000||His home world faces annihilation. Eredin's decided to invade ours. Brilliant, wouldn't you say?
   1062010|00000000||Can't achieve much on his own, so he needs to bring an army.
   1062012|00000000||Except his navigators can't possibly move him and thousands of Aen Elle between planes. Their abilities won't allow it.
   1062014|00000000||Whereas yours will…
   1062024|00000000||Exactly. And if I die in the process - well, that's a necessary sacrifice.
    580652|00000000||Any idea what Eredin wants from you?
    584754|00000000||Why is Avallac'h helping you?
    584757|00000000||Why exactly is Avallac'h helping you? Sages've never been fond of humans…
    584768|00000000||He doesn't do it for me, it's about my power.
    584770|00000000||As if it could ever be about anything else.
    584771|00000000||Avallac'h tried to teach me how to control my ability. He was also making sure I didn't fall into Eredin's hands.
    554293|00000000||We lifted the curse. He's at Kaer Morhen, waiting for you.
    580195|00000000||Are you serious? You must be. You'd not jest about something like that… Hah! A nice thing to wake up to.
   1062001|00000000||You trust him?
   1062003|00000000||Avallac'h? He's not let me down to date. Not once.
    554287|00000000||We lifted the curse. He's at Kaer Morhen.
   1072012|00000000||Guess not all of Vesemir's teachings've receded into oblivion.
   1072014|00000000||"A witcher can forget to eat, to drink, to breathe, even, but a witcher never, ever forgets to care for his blade."
   1072019|00000000||Huh. Uh, yeah, used to repeat that incessantly. Never tired of doing it, either.
    577018|00000000||What creature was it?
    577020|00000000||Huh? Creature?
    577022|00000000||One that gave you the scar over your left eye. It's new, I don't remember it.
    577027|00000000||Souvenir from the cockatrice of Spalla. Another addition to the collection, nothing special.
    577030|00000000||Yours has healed beautifully, though.
    577031|00000000||Avallac'h - he prepared some special ointments for me.
    580181|00000000||But that was before the curse gripped him… Wonder where he is now.
    580367|00000000||You landed with the Crones, he ran into Keira.
    584801|00000000||Keira? Keira Metz? What's she doing in Velen?
    585051|00000000||Nothing… Absolutely nothing… Go on, please.
    585046|00000000||Nothing, go on.
    585059|00000000||Hm… Lemme think… He's a chatterbox who's prone to hysteria and has about as much courage as a rabbit?
    585061|00000000||Ideal partner for the heist of the century, really.
    585047|00000000||He's better at other things.
    580458|00000000||And that way turned out to be Dandelion. A good friend… Not necessarily the wisest choice under the circumstances.
    580459|00000000||The best I could do. Besides, what do you have against Dandelion?
    580452|00000000||And you found Dandelion.
    580451|00000000||I know the rest.
    584805|00000000||Hiding from witch hunters.
    584802|00000000||Hiding.
    584818|00000000||She developed a taste for country life, decided to open a practice out there.
    584820|00000000||Is that so? And does she lead her cows out to pasture at dawn, milk them herself? I'd love to see that!
    584822|00000000||So would I… Except she'd need a cow, a luxury that would attract attention in Velen. And Keira's fiercely determined not to do that.
    584913|00000000||She's hiding from witch hunters.
    584803|00000000||She opened a practice.
    591830|00000000||Geraaalt!
    591832|00000000||Don't go! Don't leave meeee!
    592469|00000000||Geralt!
    574120|00000000||Can't risk your men's lives. Kaer Morhen - we fight them there, nowhere else.
    554339|00000000||Kaer Morhen is hundreds of miles away. To move an army there would take weeks, not to mention I'd expose the Isles to Nilfgaard's blows…
    574204|00000000||Geralt, forgive me, but I cannot do it.
    574240|00000000||I understand… Won't take up any more of your time. Farewell.
    574243|00000000||Wait.
    574245|00000000||Won't let you leave empty-handed. I'll help as I can. Come with me.
    574237|00000000||We can only fight them at Kaer Morhen.
    574238|00000000||You mentioned Nilfgaard.
    574875|00000000||What's this about the Nilfgaardians?
    574877|00000000||Of late, look seaward and you'll see their sun on a sail, starin' right back.
    574879|00000000||We've yet to capture any of their crew, but only a fool wouldn't know they're planning something.
    574881|00000000||But fear not, we'll banish the Black Ones and the Wild Hunt. Two birds with one Skelligan axe, heh heh.
    574883|00000000||Ciri will be safe in Kaer Trolde.
    554334|00000000||Need your help fighting the Wild Hunt.
    554333|00000000||This isn't easy, but I need to ask you a favor. A big one.
    554335|00000000||Tell me, friend.
    554336|00000000||Ciri - I know where she is. But I also know that as soon as I reach her, the Wild Hunt will know I did.
    574114|00000000||They'll come after us, attack, and we'll need to respond with strength. Can I count on you?
    554337|00000000||The Black Ones first, now wraiths… Such is life. Bring her here, and we'll face them in battle!
    574867|00000000||I can't accept this.
    574468|00000000||I can't take this.
    574301|00000000||You can, you must. Let me do this much, at least.
    574471|00000000||If you insist… Thank you.
    574473|00000000||May it serve you well. Send those specters back where they came from.
    574871|00000000||That's my intention. Farewell.
    574869|00000000||Thank you… This can't be easy for you. I appreciate it all the more.
    574866|00000000||Thank you.
    574290|00000000||Beautiful craftsmanship. Got a talented smith.
    574291|00000000||Not I. King Erlend an Craite did.
    574293|00000000||Erlend Stonefist? So this is… Winter's Blade? Thought it was a legend…
    574295|00000000||Forged in Mahakam, tempered in dragon fire… Been in the an Craite family for centuries.
    574299|00000000||And now it's yours.
    439424|00000000||I'll not let ye in till you bring me mates home.
    560360|00000000||Heehee, a fetlock in the arse…
    560361|00000000||Heehee. Stop your scamperin', you tease.
    560359|00000000||Begone… Begone, vile power.
    560371|00000000||Aaaahh… It's stronger than me, so sorrrrrrry… Zzzzzz…
    560372|00000000||Fle-fyelin' a wee bit drowsyyy…
    560370|00000000||Driftin' off! I'll soon snnnneeeerrr…
    560379|00000000||Wake up.
    560380|00000000||Neh! I don't - I don't wanna go to school.
    575925|00000000||C'mon, get up.
    575927|00000000||Oh, Nibbles, yousa naughty kitty, aren't ye?
    576362|00000000||All right! I'm up!
    575922|00000000||Wake up.
    575924|00000000||Right, right… just a wee bit longer…
    576360|00000000||Get up.
   1074031|00000000||Know much about this isle?
   1074033|00000000||Almost nothing.
   1074552|00000000||Ye know it ain't on my map.
   1074554|00000000||A common characteristic of enchanted islands.
   1074556|00000000||Ye think it enchanted?
   1074558|00000000||It's the one thing I'm sure of.
   1074035|00000000||So what is it brought you to this strange place?
   1074037|00000000||Looking for someone.
   1074560|00000000||Here?
   1074562|00000000||Mhm. Just kind of turned out that way.
   1074564|00000000||Not too keen on talkin' about it, are ye.
   1074566|00000000||Not really.
    575935|00000000||Wake up.
    575937|00000000||Deh! I'm awake, wide awake.
    576364|00000000||C'mon, keep moving.
    370828|00000000||Who are you?
    370830|00000000||They call me Geralt. Who are you?
    370832|00000000||Ah! It's that witcher! I heard a ballad about this 'un and that sorceress - what's her name…?
    370938|00000000||Shut it!
    371135|00000000||How many of you are there?
    371141|00000000||How many of you are in there?
    371143|00000000||Why d'ye need to know? Ye takin' a bloody census?
   1063389|00000000||What do you want?
   1063406|00000000||This conversation's getting tiring. Listen, let's make a deal.
   1063586|00000000||If that's a demon, it'll try to dupe us now.
   1063588|00000000||I'm not a demon. You don't need to fear me. Gimme a chance, I'll prove it.
   1063590|00000000||How ye aim to do that?
   1062621|00000000||Open up before I get angry.
   1062633|00000000||Open the door, or I'll open it myself.
   1062635|00000000||You try! These hinges, this lock - they'll withstand anythin'! 'Course, you could always come back with a platoon o' engineers, a batterin' ram and a Mahakaman locksmith.
   1062637|00000000||Why the threats?! We's all in one cart! We'd do better to help each other than argue.
   1062639|00000000||All right. What do you want?
   1062641|00000000||I want you to find our mates - Ivo, Ferenc and Gaspard. They ventured off, but they're on the isle, missin' and probably lost.
   1062643|00000000||Help 'em, help me. Please. If anyone can find 'em, I know you can.
   1059901|00000000||All right. See if I can't find all three. See ya.
   1059854|00000000||I'm content ye understand.
   1062131|00000000||Fine. I'll try to find your friends.
   1062142|00000000||Gaspard - where'll I find him?
   1062144|00000000||He said it was defeatist to sit and wait to be rescued. We had to take action, or at least he did.
   1062146|00000000||Claimed to have spotted a lantern out to sea, so he said he'd climb the highest peak to look out for ships.
   1062133|00000000||Gaspard - where do I look for him?
   1062148|00000000||Where'd Ferenc go?
   1062150|00000000||West. In search of a ship that's said to be out there.
   1062152|00000000||Ferenc, he's, uh, handy. Thought he might fix it up, make it seaworthy.
   1062134|00000000||Where'd Ferenc go?
   1062132|00000000||Where'll I find Ivo?
   1062136|00000000||This Ivo… Where do I look??
   1062138|00000000||Idgit insisted he'd explore the caves to the east.
   1062140|00000000||Tried to knock it out his head - literally! Bugger wouldn't budge.
   1062623|00000000||Say I find your mates, will you believe I mean no harm?
   1062625|00000000||Aye, but I'd not count on either comin' too easy…
   1062627|00000000||How many are there?
   1062631|00000000||Three: Ivo, Gaspard and Ferenc.
   1062620|00000000||I'll look for your lost mates.
   1063404|00000000||Got nothing to fear from me…
   1063582|00000000||…Said the fox to the gaggle o' geese.
   1063584|00000000||I've lost too many mates already. I won't risk it, I can't.
   1063388|00000000||Not gonna hurt you.
   1063390|00000000||How'd you find your way here?
   1063392|00000000||No way you can get to this isle conventionally.
   1063394|00000000||Crikey. Ye call a shipwreck conventional?
   1063396|00000000||Leave it be, mate. Ye know what he means.
   1063398|00000000||Achoo! Achoo! Let me explain. A short while past we was en route from Skellige to Novigrad.
   1063400|00000000||And Ferenc got talkin' with the captain, who sold 'im a magic firefly purported to know the way to a hidden treasure.
    575809|00000000||By me mum's beard, get yourselves together, lads.
    560199|00000000||You, there! Outside the door! Geralt - that right?!
    575812|00000000||Yeah. Geralt.
    575814|00000000||Listen, Geralt. Let's cut to the thick of it.
   1062617|00000000||We survived a shipwreck - recently. Beasts from the depths ate some of my lads, and the rest of us found shelter here.
   1063387|00000000||Not too special, that, as dangers litter this isle. But it does go to explain why we're a wee bit distrustful.
    371137|00000000||Yennefer. Sorceress' name is Yennefer of Vengerberg.
    371139|00000000||Aye, that's it! "Her eyes flashin' lightnin', her heart an icy berg…" Errm… how did it go?
    371127|00000000||Sorceress' name is Yennefer.
    370946|00000000||Starting to lose my patience.
    371129|00000000||Running short on patience.
    371131|00000000||Wonderful. Means you're about to go the fuck away.
    371133|00000000||I'm starting to get angry.
    370930|00000000||I'm Geralt, a witcher.
    370932|00000000||Argh. Go away!
    370934|00000000||Looking for a young woman - ashen hair, scar on her face. Will you let me in?
    370936|00000000||No!
    370826|00000000||I'm looking for a young woman with ashen hair.
    370812|00000000||Locked…
    370814|00000000||Anybody in there?
    370816|00000000||Damn…
    370818|00000000||Achoo!
    370820|00000000||I'm not gonna hurt you. Open up.
    370822|00000000||Ach! Ye blew our fuckin' cover.
    370824|00000000||Who are ye and whaddaya want?
    312802|05e75e62||Harpy
    305735|00000000||Brought you your friend.
    576264|00000000||That so? Let's hear him, then.
    576266|00000000||Wake up.
    305737|00000000||I'm awake!
    560391|00000000||Haha! Gaspard! Stand back, I'm openin' the door!
