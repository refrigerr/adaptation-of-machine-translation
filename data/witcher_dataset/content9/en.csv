    539847|00000000||I'm here.
    585731|00000000||Did you lose your way?
    585733|00000000||No. You just run too fast.
    585845|00000000||Or you've gotten old.
    539848|00000000||Shall we?
    559928|00000000||Sure, lead the way.
    559925|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
    559927|00000000||Wait, just remembered something. Be right back.
    560541|00000000||I'll wait here.
    559926|00000000||Gimme a minute.
    538453|00000000||Where's this friend of yours?
    538454|00000000||Hmm… There!
    538455|00000000||Valdo!
    538444|00000000||Why're you doing this again?
    538445|00000000||I want to look him in the eyes.
    538446|00000000||What then?
    538447|00000000||Don't know. Depends what I see.
    558929|00000000||See you outside the Golden Sturgeon!
    557893|00000000||A friend of Dandelion's. Her name's Bea.
    571111|00000000||She's a waitress at the Golden Sturgeon.
    538449|00000000||Helped me contact Dandelion.
    538450|00000000||I wish to thank her. She risked a lot.
    557961|00000000||Risked a lot? How's that?
    557914|00000000||The Temple Guard were breathing down my neck.
    557964|00000000||If she'd been seen with me, she might've been flogged, or worse.
    557928|00000000||Always getting into trouble…
    557930|00000000||I take after you.
    558330|00000000||Why're are we going to the Sturgeon?
    558332|00000000||To see a girl who helped me once.
    558334|00000000||Who might that be?
    538448|00000000||This girl we're going to see - who is she again?
    560512|00000000||What's there to see in Farcorners?
    560514|00000000||The camp of some traveling circus performers. Nonhumans.
    560516|00000000||When I came here before, I wanted to contact Triss.
    560518|00000000||Life was hard. I quickly spent nearly everything the baron gave me.
    560520|00000000||Triss and I never met, because the Temple Guard showed up.
    585703|00000000||I was a wanted woman afterwards.
    585705|00000000||Triss didn't try to contact you?
    585707|00000000||How could she? She didn't know anything.
    585709|00000000||In fact, she thought she was to meet another alchemist wanting to flee Novigrad.
    585711|00000000||I preferred not to put her in danger.
    560521|00000000||I was being hunted, had not a copper to my name.
    560522|00000000||Then I met Valdo.
    560523|00000000||He and his troupe helped me, then introduced me to Bea, and through Bea I found Dandelion.
    560533|00000000||You know the rest.
   1043355|00000000||I'll meet you there!
    558930|00000000||See you in Farcorners!
   1043844|00000000||I visited a city once that was very much like Novigrad.
   1058965|00000000||But the people there were much taller and had dark skin.
   1043846|00000000||This somewhere in Zerrikania?
   1058959|00000000||No. In another world.
   1058961|00000000||Hmm… What's it like, hopping between worlds?
   1058967|00000000||Anything like passing through a portal? Or different?
   1058963|00000000||A bit different.
   1058969|00000000||It was hard going at first.
   1058971|00000000||I wasn't very good at controlling it. So I had to concentrate intensely and hope I didn't land in the crater of an active volcano.
   1058986|00000000||The training I did with Avallac'h was very helpful.
   1058988|00000000||Now I merely think of the place I wish to travel to, close my eyes - and it's done.
    569484|00000000||That was… strange.
    569485|00000000||To say the least.
    572945|00000000||I wonder what they're doing.
    572947|00000000||We'll know soon enough.
    585873|00000000||So, your friend... Bea…
    585875|00000000||What about her?
    585877|00000000||Nothing, seems nice…
    585879|00000000||Geraaalt, you're terrible.
    585881|00000000||What'd I say?
   1043357|00000000||At last, there you are!
   1007872|00000000||Should I shoot?
   1007874|00000000||Nay, the White One once served the Ladies.
   1007876|00000000||But… he's an outsider!
   1015546|00000000||Learn to live without them.
   1015554|00000000||There won't be any more acorns. Need to get by without them.
   1015620|00000000||What now?
   1015589|00000000||Your acorns? No idea. Path to the summit's clear - you can always go looking for them.
   1015643|00000000||Or just go home.
   1015582|00000000||I don't know.
   1015583|00000000||You'll need to live without them.
   1015590|00000000||Don't know, don't care.
   1015645|00000000||You must learn to live without them.
   1015551|00000000||This is no longer no man's land, it's no longer the Ladies' land. It's all yours.
   1015636|00000000||But… what're we to do?
   1015638|00000000||Come, Geralt. It's time.
   1015640|00000000||Manage… on your own.
   1015553|00000000||I've got one. Take it.
   1015585|00000000||But one? What'll we do now?
   1015545|00000000||Got one. Yours if you want it.
   1015586|00000000||The oak is dead!
   1015587|00000000||The oak, the Crones. I fear that was your last feast.
   1015588|00000000||What of our acorns?
   1061350|00000000||There y'are. How'd you fare? Margarita with you?
   1061354|00000000||Yen's got her. Probably at Dandelion's already.
   1061353|00000000||Grand work, there, both of you. Guards didn't even notice they had guests.
   1061356|00000000||So, comin' with me to Dandelion's, or you gonna faff about along the way?
    537208|00000000||Always up for a ride with you.
    537209|00000000||Let's hit the road, then!
    537206|00000000||I'll go with you.
    560187|00000000||You clearly don't need an escort. I'll go on foot.
    560188|00000000||Heheh, fine. Meet ya there.
    560186|00000000||I'll get back alone.
   1060240|00000000||So what'd you do? How'd you get 'em drunk?
   1060242|00000000||Can't help being curious - how'd you get 'em drunk?
   1060244|00000000||Ach, oldest trick in the book. Posed as a merchant conveyin' some wine. Soon as they eyed me, they decided an inspection was in order.
   1060246|00000000||I started wailin', beggin' 'em to leave it. The best Redanian, I says, boss at the Passiflora'll have my balls. That settled it - they had to inspect it, each and every barrel…
   1060248|00000000||Good plan. And good work. Thanks, Zoltan.
   1060250|00000000||Don't mention it. So, you goin' to Dandelion's with me, or alone?
    537204|00000000||Finally here. Your plan blew arsechunks.
    562665|00000000||Why?
    537205|00000000||Soon as you started that butchery in the courtyard, they all wanted to run over there.
    562668|00000000||Had to hold 'em back… through conventional means.
    562670|00000000||By yourself? All of them? Where are the bodies?
    562672|00000000||Hid 'em in the wagon. Runnin' a tavern with Dandelion's given me plenty of practice disposin' of corpses.
    562677|00000000||By-the-by, goin' back with me, or got aught to do along the way?
   1062194|00000000||Here we are.
   1062196|00000000||Thanks again for your help, Zoltan.
   1062198|00000000||Always willin', mate.
    171521|002e2335||Fiend
    528664|00000000||Take your friend and go for a walk.
    528665|00000000||Perhaps we've earned a break…
    528666|00000000||Aye, high time…
    528662|00000000||Leave, now.
    532187|00000000||Get outta here. Both of you.
    532188|00000000||Don't rightly believe you know who you're talking to.
    554616|00000000||Oh, I do - two idiots. Soon to be two dead idiots.
    532151|00000000||Leave or regret it.
    528657|00000000||So long.
    528663|00000000||Farewell.
    554592|00000000||Here for the body.
    528658|00000000||Here to take the body.
    528659|00000000||First we've heard of anyone collecting it.
    554605|00000000||Guard the witch, those're our orders.
    554599|00000000||What was her crime?
    554600|00000000||Same as all of 'em! Witchcraft and fornication with succubi!
    554603|00000000||Cunt tried to seduce Radovid. But he saw through her. Showed her what we do to traitors.
   1011733|00000000||Moon's arisin', owl's hootin', fire's just a gleam.
   1011734|00000000||Hour's late and slumber calls ye, close your eyes and dream.
    532199|00000000||Guess they underestimated Philippa…
   1058992|00000000||You were right. She must've changed back into human form.
   1058994|00000000||Quick!
    531714|00000000||Watch out!
    545347|00000000||I sense strong magic.
    545349|00000000||We have to get inside.
    568811|00000000||Damn, she cast a spell on them.
   1043633|00000000||I hope we get there in time. I hope Dijkstra hasn't already hurt her.
   1043635|00000000||The possibilities are many. Could be Dijkstra that got hurt.
   1058949|00000000||Not likely. Dijkstra never forgave her for sending assassins after him. And Philippa's weakened, no doubt about it.
   1058947|00000000||Weakened, maybe, but still a powerful sorceress.
   1058990|00000000||If Dijkstra's men take the dimeritium off, Philippa'll kill them before they can say "Oh shit."
    558805|00000000||Geralt! On your left!
    558806|00000000||Geralt? You say "Geralt"?
    558919|00000000||Argh!
    558920|00000000||You're gonna die!
   1043425|00000000||Wait… Stand down!
    558510|00000000||Thanks for taking Ciri in.
    558532|00000000||Likewise. And thanks for helping Ciri.
    558534|00000000||Oh, we had no choice! Found it hard to refuse a lass like her!
    535343|00000000||Provided we can find the animals to carry us. Two of our horses dropped on the way, another two are too weak to haul anything.
    579309|00000000||Maybe we can help?
    579343|00000000||Hm… Any way we can help?
    579345|00000000||Oh, don't you fret about us. We always get by somehow, right, Ciri?
    535351|00000000||Geralt! Choose one of these!
    535352|00000000||Coming, coming…
    558560|00000000||Gladly.
    558562|00000000||A man after my own spirit! Come!
    558552|00000000||Why not.
    558563|00000000||No, thanks. Not up to it today.
    558602|00000000||For every ache of body and soul, there's no better remedy than Kaedweni golden, isn't that right, Ciri?
    558606|00000000||As rain.
    558608|00000000||Stay with us! Bonfires to be lit soon round which all will gather! This night shall be ours!
    558556|00000000||No, thanks.
    535345|00000000||What brings you here?
    535346|00000000||I've come to apologize. I disappeared so suddenly then…
    558401|00000000||Pish-posh! What matters is you're back, and you're well.
    558405|00000000||This is for you. All that you loaned me plus a small premium.
    558407|00000000||Ciri… You know I can't take this…
    558470|00000000||And you know I shan't let you refuse.
    558473|00000000||Hmm… I know! We'll make it the pot for a wager! Do you still race?
    558548|00000000||Of course.
    558550|00000000||Then I challenge you! Geralt, will you join us?
    579321|00000000||What's eating him?
    579333|00000000||Oh, don't worry. That's just how Aegar is. Be back to his jolly old self by evening.
    579243|00000000||He mad about something?
    579295|00000000||We'll manage somehow! We don't leave till tomorrow, so naught to worry about today!
    579301|00000000||Yes… For some. I'm off to see a merchant. There's a chance I can trade our nags for a healthy horse.
    579308|00000000||Wouldn't want Valdo to have anything to worry about tomorrow…
    571178|00000000||They're to start resettling nonhumans shortly. We'd rather stay ahead of events.
    571181|00000000||I understand…
    579297|00000000||Problem is, we just lost two horses, and another two are too weak to haul anything.
    571174|00000000||Weeelll, good you're here. Come in the nick of time! We'd have been gone by tomorrow.
    579277|00000000||You're leaving?
    558529|00000000||Mostly lies, I bet.
    558536|00000000||If it's a lie that since her youngest years you've been her friend and mentor, then indeed - she is a bold-faced liar!
    558509|00000000||Exaggerated tales from Ciri, probably.
    535342|00000000||Ciri! You devil incarnate! Where've you been?!
    579242|00000000||Come here, darling! Hallo - what's this? Brought your granddad?
    579258|00000000||Aegar, you're incorrigible.
    571192|00000000||Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia.
    535344|00000000||Ahh, greetings! We've heard heaps about you!
    472745|0ead2ac8||Barmaid
   1059609|00000000||Farewell.
   1013328|00000000||Bye.
   1013327|00000000||What's on the peak?
   1013330|00000000||Can't help but be curious - what's at the summit?
   1013332|00000000||Tell 'im.
   1013334|00000000||The Ladies dwell there. But only the Chosen may look upon them.
   1013336|00000000||I know that, I want--
   1013338|00000000||You'll learn nothin' else here.
   1005629|00000000||They're back.
   1005630|00000000||Whaddaya want?
   1004151|00000000||Ciri, what do you think?
   1004157|00000000||Ciri?
   1004158|00000000||Wonderful. Who wouldn't want to meet the Ladies?
   1004159|00000000||My companion comes with me.
   1005175|00000000||Appearances can be deceiving, I'm worthy.
   1005186|00000000||You misjudged me. I'm worthy as anyone.
   1005326|00000000||Mmm… Girl?
   1005327|00000000||He's sprier than any youth. Only smells like corpses because he kills monsters.
   1005328|00000000||And he'll kill any who stand in his way.
   1005383|00000000||Look this over - a coin from days of yore. Falka burns on its reverse, so they call it the Defier's Oren.
   1013283|00000000||Now bring me the coin.
   1005381|00000000||I accept the challenge.
   1005382|00000000||Heheheh. Come.
   1005331|00000000||I'll take your challenge.
   1005332|00000000||What challenge?
   1005334|00000000||What kind of challenge?
   1005335|00000000||Tell 'im.
   1005336|00000000||You must descend into the cave and bathe in the waters below the earth.
   1005337|00000000||What's the catch?
   1005338|00000000||The waters're deep, the waters're murky.
   1005329|00000000||Perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps there's life in 'im yet?
   1005330|00000000||By ancient rite, you may appeal my choice. But to do so you must best the challenge.
   1005182|00000000||I'm going with her.
   1005183|00000000||Heheheh, he's fire in his gut. What do ye see?
   1005184|00000000||He's determined. He loves the girl, but he seeks to hide it from us.
   1005174|00000000||I'm going with her. That's that.
   1005176|00000000||What's this about?
   1005177|00000000||What's this about? What've you chosen her for?
   1005178|00000000||Tell 'im.
   1005179|00000000||Each year three Chosen have the honor to meet the Ladies.
   1005180|00000000||What happens after they've had this honor?
   1005181|00000000||When they return, they speak o' the past no more. Joy rules them and they start life anew.
   1059155|00000000||The lass were not the first to be chosen this day. But the moon hangs high, so she's like to be the last.
   1004152|00000000||Hmhm. What else has the cat dragged in?
   1004153|00000000||It's gray and veiny. Got a scar. And eyes like a viper.
   1004155|00000000||Aye, mff… Stinks of clotted blood and corpses. Plus it's old and infertile.
   1004156|00000000||I reject ye, freak - the girl will ascend alone.
   1004160|00000000||If she goes up the mountain, I go with her.
   1004150|00000000||I'm going with her.
   1004145|00000000||Hm… Who's that?
   1004146|00000000||Well, c'mon, come closer, girl!
   1004147|00000000||Aye. What's she like?
   1004148|00000000||Narrow hips, sparkly eyes - a strikin', feisty lass.
   1004149|00000000||Never had a man? Mff. Never mind, got me answer.
   1005173|00000000||I choose you, girl. This night you shall see the Ladies.
   1059249|00000000||Go on, then - jump. Ye wish to see the Ladies, don't ye?
   1059593|00000000||Come. I shall open the gate, show you the path to the peak.
    564648|00000000||Interesting, what he said about the guards.
    564652|00000000||What he said about the guards - could prove handy.
    564654|00000000||True. Things will go more smoothly if we can get even a few of them drunk.
    564658|00000000||Zoltan oughta manage it. I'll ask him.
    561710|00000000||Let's meet on the Oxenfurt Bridge.
    564671|00000000||What our friend said about the guards was interesting…
    564673|00000000||Drinking on duty? Zoltan could make sure they have plenty of hooch.
    564676|00000000||Good idea. I'll search for the entrance to the ruins.
    564650|00000000||What now?
    564647|00000000||What now?
    536062|00000000||See? Wasn't so hard.
    561686|00000000||One last bit of advice - find a new tavern. Everyone here knows you.
    536064|00000000||Thank you. Whatever your plans, I hope they work out.
    561690|00000000||So do we. So long.
    561683|00000000||Thanks for the help.
    561565|00000000||So theoretically we could get in the way you got out.
    561572|00000000||Assuming we don't mind the company of decomposing corpses.
    561574|00000000||And assuming you can squeeze through the grate. They barred the outlet to the river after I escaped.
    561579|00000000||Huh. Explosives could take care of that.
    561575|00000000||For half the city to hear us? I've a better plan. Oxenfurt was built on elven ruins…
    561582|00000000||Which have to connect to the sewers somewhere. If we can find a way into the ruins…
    564643|00000000||We'll get into the prison.
    561554|00000000||Can we get in through the sewers?
    536053|00000000||They say Deireadh's better guarded than the keep at Vicovaro.
    536054|00000000||They choose the guards from among witch hunters - the worst dregs, rabid fanatics! if you only knew what they do to folk…
    561648|00000000||Torture everyday - the wheel, the rack… We only knew peace on holidays, when they'd drink themselves blind.
    561664|00000000||They're allowed to drink on duty?
    561665|00000000||No-not officially but… you know how it is.
    536011|00000000||What about the guard?
    561454|00000000||So you played dead… No one caught on?
    536058|00000000||As a youth I'd apprenticed with an apothecary in Silverton. Learned a thing or two about herbs.
    561507|00000000||Sleeping mushrooms grew on the walls of my cell. And I found belladonna in the prison yard.
    564645|00000000||Just had to mash them together and eat the pulp an hour before evening rounds…
    561469|00000000||You might have lost your life.
    561471|00000000||I preferred to die on my own terms were that to be my fate.
    561538|00000000||How'd you fake your death?
    536010|00000000||Heard no one gets out of Deireadh alive.
    536056|00000000||They say no one gets outta Deireadh alive…
    536057|00000000||Aye, so they say… My thought - why not try it dead?
    561531|00000000||But they burn the corpses.
    561476|00000000||They didn't start burning them until they learned an old fellow like myself had escaped. Before, they'd drop the stiffs into a great pit.
    561479|00000000||The pit's connected to the sewers, and the sewers empty into the river. And once you reach the river, you're as free as a fish.
    536003|00000000||Drink up, it'll help.
    561411|00000000||Thanks… What do you want?
    536006|00000000||To get into Deireadh.
    564802|00000000||Find a hunter, tell him you practice magic. They'll lock you up lickety-split.
    561449|00000000||We need to get in without anyone noticing. Tell us how you escaped, then get on with your life.
    538349|00000000||Welcome, Child of the Elder Blood.
    538364|00000000||We knew you would return.
    538366|00000000||Your taste lingers on our tongues.
    536478|00000000||You've talked enough.
    576302|00000000||Argh!
    576305|00000000||Come here.
    576308|00000000||Dammit.
    546694|00000000||Almost there.
    557621|00000000||Where are we going exactly?
    557623|00000000||To see Whoreson Junior.
    557635|00000000||Lead the way.
    557627|00000000||Let's go.
    557626|00000000||That's not the way to Whoreson's.
    557631|00000000||Wrong direction. Whoreson's headquartered on Temple Isle.
    557633|00000000||So I thought, but I think we should check something first.
    571080|00000000||Zoltan claims the word in town is we're more likely to run into Whoreson around here.
    557629|00000000||Let's go.
    557650|00000000||Lead the way.
    557636|00000000||Bit late for that. He's dead.
    557639|00000000||I asked Zoltan, and he said Whoreson's alive and well on Temple Isle.
    557641|00000000||I was there, stuck a sword in his gut.
    557646|00000000||Your hand must've slipped, because it seems he's recovered.
    557628|00000000||He's dead.
    587305|00000000||I'd lost hope that you'd appear.
    587307|00000000||We couldn't wait for you to show.
    587310|00000000||What about me? Don't I get any?
    587312|00000000||You…
    587314|00000000||…just got exactly what you deserve.
    587317|00000000||Hey! This isn't funny!
    587319|00000000||Come back!
    587321|00000000||Triss! Yen!
    563089|00000000||You wished to speak.
    563090|00000000||To you. Not to Geralt.
    563095|00000000||Geralt stays or we both leave.
    563097|00000000||Let him stay, Phil. He'd learn of it all anyways, eventually.
    563102|00000000||Ekhem. Fine then. So long as he does not interrupt.
    563234|00000000||I won't. Until Ciri decides otherwise.
    563218|00000000||Not up to you.
    563217|00000000||I'm all ears.
    563219|00000000||Think of me as part of the decor.
    563104|00000000||The Lodge once had great plans for you, important plans. Surely you remember.
    563251|00000000||You were to complete your studies and become one of us. Unfortunately, that did not come to pass.
    563199|00000000||We intend to revive the Lodge. And we renew our… offer - you must join us.
    586380|00000000||We are saddened our dear sisters, Keira and Síle, will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
    586378|00000000||We are saddened our dear Keira will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
    586376|00000000||We are saddened our dear Síle will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
    586393|00000000||What is your decision? Will you join us?
    563203|00000000||As before? I'm to marry some princeling and become your puppet?
    563239|00000000||You were a child then, and we… misjudged the situation.
    563241|00000000||This time we offer you a partnership.
    563322|00000000||The Lodge of Sorceresses has been outlawed throughout the Continent.
    563323|00000000||Joining them means facing persecution, always being on the run.
    563335|00000000||Kings die, realms fall, but magic endures.
    563288|00000000||The Lodge is wanted by the law, you'll be on the run again.
    563285|00000000||With the Lodge, someone's always in charge.
    563293|00000000||No equality in the Lodge. That's garbage. Some have always taken the reins, while others politely nodded.
    563490|00000000||A wise and capable sorceress finds the role, the position that best suits her.
    563497|00000000||And yours should be supreme, you deserve to lead.
    572020|00000000||Realize, please, that you were made for great things. Work with us and you shall achieve them…
    563341|00000000||Just as soon as we teach you to control your power, channel--
    563534|00000000||I have Avallac'h for that…
    563537|00000000||You allow this? Do you truly believe his intentions are pure?
    563556|00000000||Purer than yours, that's certain.
    563551|00000000||Yes. Avallac'h can be trusted.
    563557|00000000||I don't trust him, I don't trust you, but that doesn't matter. Ciri decides.
    563552|00000000||I don't trust anyone. It's Ciri's decision.
    563550|00000000||No, but better him than you.
    563553|00000000||I don't, but I'd rather deal with one Sage than the entire Lodge.
    547931|00000000||Sages invariably have hidden agendas. Altruism is simply not part of their constitution.
    572033|00000000||You're a tool in his hands, even if you don't see it.
    547989|00000000||We will assure you knowledge and protection, but you shall be your own rudder, captain and ship.
    563563|00000000||And unlike Avallac'h, we can promise you this.
    563567|00000000||We don't expect you to commit now. Think it over, what you've heard, what you feel. We will speak when you're ready.
    563565|00000000||If that is all, then…
    563583|00000000||…We need to go to Skellige, find the Sunstone.
    563585|00000000||Avallac'h awaits down at the port.
    563593|00000000||…Let's get some fresh air.
   1086304|00000000||I won't let you take her and do what only you see fit.
   1062046|00000000||Who taught you to fight like this?
   1062048|00000000||The witcher you slew.
    581320|00000000||Ugh…
   1051087|00000000||Gods protect us…
   1051089|00000000||We needn't 'ave come here. We'll ire the Ladies, they'll punish us harsh!
   1051091|00000000||Too late to undo. Now stop your chatterin'.
    576429|00000000||He found his wife, took her away, somewhere far. Anna… she was unwell.
    576431|00000000||Ventured into the swamp to look for his wife. No idea if he ever found her.
    565166|00000000||Let's get this done.
    565168|00000000||We must reach the peak, we'll find Imlerith there.
    565159|00000000||Let's go.
    565837|00000000||We stand to find Imlerith here? You sure?
    565839|00000000||Avallac'h told me of beings who commune with the Aen Elle elves. They can be found in every part of our world. In Velen, the Crones do this.
    565841|00000000||Apparently, Imlerith came here at Eredin's behest, to order the Crones to keep their eyes open and ears pricked. In case Avallac'h were to seek shelter in his Velen hideout.
    576464|00000000||Took the order literally judging by all the ears hanging in the woods. Think Imlerith might still be here?
    565843|00000000||He craves the pleasures of the flesh - wine, sex… The Crones indulge him, flatter his ego. I'm certain he'd not let this opportunity pass, and will be on Bald Mountain for the Sabbath.
    565161|00000000||You actually know Imlerith will be there? How?
    565162|00000000||Familiar with this place?
    565847|00000000||You actually know this area?
    565849|00000000||Centuries ago it was a hallowed site for druids. But then the Crones arrived - destroyed the Velen Circle and deformed the sacred oak atop the mountain.
    565853|00000000||An important feast is observed here annually. The Sabbath, they call it - all the local folk attend. I suspect Imlerith attends, too - as the Crones' guest.
    576846|00000000||Seem to know it well.
    576848|00000000||Avallac'h's a good tutor.
    576854|00000000||A true shame.
    576427|00000000||Hanged himself after his wife died. Daughter's in Novigrad.
    564939|00000000||The men at Crow's Perch, they spoke of this place.
    576423|00000000||Aard Cerbin. Home of the Ladies of the Wood.
    576844|00000000||The peasants feared coming here. And the baron thought the Ladies of the Wood a terrifying tale for naughty children. Incidentally, I wonder how the baron is.
    560587|00000000||Spare me your lecture.
    560604|00000000||Spare me your lecture about responsibility.
    560606|00000000||I was actually going to recite an anthem praising your glory, but if you're not in the mood…
    560586|00000000||Ciri's.
    560601|00000000||Ciri's.
    560602|00000000||As I thought. I'm glad you went with her.
    560661|00000000||Dangerous times, especially for sorceresses. Each thinks five times before sticking her neck out.
    560688|00000000||What do you know about this fugitive?
    560689|00000000||I know he's the only one ever to escape from Deireadh. Every guardsman in the city now seeks him.
    560691|00000000||Sure he can be trusted?
    560695|00000000||We'll soon find out. He just walked in.
    560632|00000000||Who is this guy?
    560610|00000000||What're you doing here?
   1061333|00000000||Nothing to tell yet. Came to get you first.
   1061337|00000000||So, gonna tell me why you're here?
   1061331|00000000||I was able to establish Margarita's whereabouts - the prison in Oxenfurt.
   1061327|00000000||I also learned the identity of a man who escaped from there. He should arrive shortly.
   1061329|00000000||Triss and I found her and freed her. It turned out Dijkstra had her. But the situation's under control.
   1061339|00000000||That's a relief.
   1061335|00000000||You'll find out soon. In the meantime, tell me about Philippa.
    560619|00000000||Hm. Charming place. Why're you here?
    560631|00000000||What're you doing here?
    560633|00000000||About the Lodge…
    560655|00000000||How'd it go with the Lodge? Anyone agree to help?
    560657|00000000||I'm afraid the situation looks grim.
    560666|00000000||Talked to Triss. Reconvening the Lodge - it's not going so well…
    560684|00000000||And I can't blame them.
    560663|00000000||But it's neither the time nor place for this discussion. Triss will tell you more.
    560597|00000000||I thought you'd be angry.
    560599|00000000||Angry? Why? Because you supported Ciri in her decision? Or because you fought by her side and won?
    560614|00000000||What if we'd lost?
    560615|00000000||We wouldn't be having this conversation. And the female part of the Continent's population would be drowning in tears.
    560617|00000000||You won. No point bothering with "what ifs."
    560609|00000000||Not mad?
    560589|00000000||Mine.
    560591|00000000||Lying didn't always come so easily to you.
    560593|00000000||If you intend to--
    560595|00000000||I was about to say... it's nice that you protect her. And you did the right thing to go with her.
    560585|00000000||Mine.
    535825|00000000||Buy you a drink?
    535826|00000000||I'm afraid the dishwater's as good as it gets in this establishment.
    560582|00000000||Imlerith - was that your idea or Ciri's?
   1043532|00000000||These humans grow wilder by the day!
   1043534|00000000||Watch where you're goin', eh?
   1043544|00000000||Man who bumped you - which way did he go?
   1043546|00000000||That way!
   1043548|00000000||Where'd he go?! Man who bumped into you.
   1043550|00000000||There! Scampered along the wall o' that house!
    548025|00000000||Not going with her?
    563613|00000000||Can't hold her hand if they're gonna take her seriously.
    563616|00000000||True. Good decision.
    563647|00000000||Calm down. You'll wear a hole in the floor.
    563649|00000000||I'll calm down once she comes out.
    563640|00000000||Pacing's making me nervous.
    563625|00000000||Don't worry, she'll be fine.
    563642|00000000||Relax, she'll be fine.
    563643|00000000||Rita won't hurt her, but Philippa… She can be ruthless.
    563681|00000000||Ciri's been in tougher situations and come out of them all right.
    563683|00000000||True, we managed to instill some principles, skills that have helped…
    563685|00000000||Exactly, so there's nothing to be afraid of.
    563693|00000000||Of course.
    563696|00000000||I'll just have a peek.
    563757|00000000||Knew you couldn't resist…
    563804|00000000||Pots and kettles, Geralt. You were dying to do the same, I saw you.
    563806|00000000||You're the one with your face to the door.
    563807|00000000||Mhm, which is why I can see what's happening.
    563712|00000000||Expected as much.
    563814|00000000||Finally. Thought you wouldn't do it, didn't have the gall.
    563713|00000000||Finally. Thought you didn't have the gall.
    563711|00000000||Stop spying.
    563716|00000000||Don't spy on her. You really have that little faith?
    563718|00000000||I don't trust Philippa and Rita.
    563726|00000000||So why'd you even allow this meeting to happen?
    563729|00000000||For the same reason you did: if they're to respect her, she can't be seen to be hanging on to my apron strings.
    563838|00000000||Lemme have a look.
    563846|00000000||In your dreams.
    563699|00000000||Lemme see.
    563698|00000000||What do you see?
    563708|00000000||What do you see?
    563852|00000000||Philippa pontificating. Ciri pacing wall to wall.
    563861|00000000||She's stopped.
    563863|00000000||She's saying something.
    563864|00000000||Philippa's turned pale!
    577383|00000000||That's my Ciri. Probably gave her an earful.
    577381|00000000||Bravo, Ciri!
    577380|00000000||What now?
    577385|00000000||What now?
    577389|00000000||Quiet! Here she comes.
    563903|00000000||So?
    563905|00000000||You were eavesdropping.
    563908|00000000||Yes.
    563910|00000000||No.
    563921|00000000||You haven't changed a bit.
    587953|00000000||I must unwind. I'll go for a walk.
    564031|00000000||Foot in mouth, as usual.
    587956|00000000||What're you talking about?
    587957|00000000||Nothing.
    564163|00000000||What is this?
    564176|00000000||Something's not right. What're you up to?
    564178|00000000||Don't be nervous.
    564234|00000000||I don't like that idea.
    564238|00000000||I don't like this…
    564242|00000000||You soon will…
    564034|00000000||Just wanted to…
    564035|00000000||Go meet Avallac'h. He wished to see you, apparently.
    564122|00000000||I hope she's…
    564123|00000000||She'll be fine. She's tougher than we think.
    564126|00000000||You ought to visit Avallac'h. He wished to see you, apparently.
    564202|00000000||We've always loved each other, you're in love with us…
    564223|00000000||There's no point in fighting it. We must enjoy what we have.
    564225|00000000||So we've prepared… something special.
    564227|00000000||Come by the Kingfisher this evening…
    564243|00000000||Bring wine. Lots of wine.
    564246|00000000||See you later, love.
    564248|00000000||I can't wait.
    564264|00000000||This'll be interesting…
    564236|00000000||Together? Go on…
    564233|00000000||I like that idea.
    564188|00000000||Yen and I, well, we talked and concluded…
    564197|00000000||…That we've wasted much too much time fighting… over you.
    564198|00000000||Meanwhile, we'll probably soon face the Wild Hunt, most likely battle Eredin himself… And who knows what could happen.
    564199|00000000||So, we decided we must try to make the most of the time we have left. Together.
    564174|00000000||You two are acting strange…
    564255|00000000||Us? No…
    564162|00000000||You're acting strange.
    587969|00000000||Geralt… Geralt, wake up.
    587971|00000000||Wh…what? Yen? Something wrong?
    587973|00000000||Wake up. Sit with us a while.
    587329|00000000||Triss? You here too? What's, uh, going on?
    587330|00000000||We need to tell you something.
    564151|00000000||Since it seems to be over, perhaps…
    564154|00000000||Yes, good idea.
    562945|00000000||What happened?
    564048|00000000||Our… beloved witcher was just demonstrating what we love most in him: his candidness.
    587959|00000000||I could use a little rest myself…
    587962|00000000||Good idea. Get some sleep.
    564012|00000000||Take a walk, get some air… We need to sail to Skellige. Avallach's waiting at the port.
    564014|00000000||Of course. I'll be there soon.
    563938|00000000||Tell us what you talked about?
    563940|00000000||I'd rather not. Not yet, at least.
    563957|00000000||Of course, when you're ready.
    563922|00000000||What happened. Tell us.
    563923|00000000||If you wanna be alone…
    563959|00000000||If you wanna be alone for a while, to digest, process…
    563961|00000000||Yes. I shall go for a walk. I must unwind.
    564070|00000000||Remember, we need to go to Skellige. Avallac'h awaits at the port.
    564072|00000000||I remember. I'll be there soon.
    564250|00000000||So?
    564252|00000000||I don't know… Don't really want to talk about it… I'm going for a walk.
    562966|00000000||How'd it go?
    562967|00000000||No casualties, so not bad, I suppose.
    562968|00000000||Ciri can handle herself… Gets it from you…
    559864|00000000||At him!
    559866|00000000||Kill the freak!
    570944|00000000||Wha… What's happenin'?
    570946|00000000||W-w-witcher. He's gotta die.
    570948|00000000||Kill the witcher.
    568785|00000000||Die, mutant!
    569337|00000000||Damn…
    569338|00000000||Ugh. Best run and get him.
    535959|00000000||Abbé Faria?
    535960|00000000||Who's asking?
    535961|00000000||We'd like to talk.
    536842|00000000||Locked tight, won't budge. Gotta be a lever around here somewhere…
    536925|00000000||Wall looks brittle…
   1043842|00000000||Hm... Mechanism's broken, missing a piece. Replace it with something else, maybe?
    548998|00000000||Help!
    548999|00000000||Stop screaming, or I'll harm you.
    560181|00000000||Alarm! Intruders!
    560182|00000000||Argh!
    560183|00000000||For the Eternal Fire!
    562440|00000000||Who are you?
    565192|00000000||How'd you get in here?
    565193|00000000||Intruuuderrrr!
    569344|00000000||Run, he's getting away!
    569371|00000000||Dammit, scaled the ladder. Guess I'm in for a roof walk…
    569505|00000000||What's this?! Drinkin' on duty?!
    569506|00000000||Whosh to shay I can't?
    569525|00000000||Curse you, witcher.
    569539|00000000||Alaarrm!
    569547|00000000||Psst! Geralt! Over here!
   1043836|00000000||Guards're drunk… Could get louder than sober men if they notice me.
   1043838|00000000||Geralt!
   1043916|00000000||That oughta do it.
   1044160|00000000||This'll come in handy.
   1052080|00000000||Catch him!
   1052082|00000000||Sure the guards don't know about the passage through the ruins, haven't planted sentries there?
   1052088|00000000||They haven't.
   1052090|00000000||How can you be sure?
   1059181|00000000||Novigrad's hierarchs have taken great care to eradicate any and all memories of the city's elven roots.
   1059183|00000000||Even if anyone remembers the ruins are there, they have no recollection of how far and where they extend. And I'm absolutely certain no one's thought to place sentries there.
   1059185|00000000||Hope you're right.
    580023|00000000||What is this? Have you gone mad?!
    580025|00000000||We were to revel, not punch each other to a pulp!
    577355|00000000||Had a falling out… with Ciri's companion.
    580032|00000000||See you later.
    580040|00000000||I understand. Let's meet at Dandelion's.
    580034|00000000||Sorry for that.
    580036|00000000||You've no need to apologize for acting according to your nature.
    580038|00000000||I'll meet you back at Dandelion's.
    580031|00000000||I'm sorry.
    580017|00000000||Ciri… Much as I hate to say it, I think it's time the two of you left.
    577357|00000000||I know, the magic's gone. Sorry.
    580030|00000000||I'm going down to the riverside. Want to take a walk, be alone for a bit.
    577360|00000000||Should've made that clear to your friend!
    562199|00000000||Margarita!
    562201|00000000||Who… Who's that?
    562203|00000000||Geralt? Gods, I'm hallucinating…
    562208|00000000||Getting you outta here.
    562287|00000000||It's pointless… You'll never open it without the key…
    562288|00000000||The warden keeps them with him at all times. His room is upstairs.
    562322|00000000||Be right back.
    537112|00000000||No chance. We'll both die in here.
    562231|00000000||Síle?
    562224|00000000||They captured her first. Her condition's critical.
    537133|00000000||Let's go.
    537140|00000000||Yen, we should go. Nothing we can do to save her.
    537141|00000000||No. But we can help her die the way she wants to.
    537142|00000000||I won't do it.
   1062825|00000000||I will.
   1062827|00000000||Come. We must hurry, or we'll lose Rita, too.
    562412|00000000||I can't pass through the portal with you both. You'll need to get out on your own.
    562414|00000000||Don't like portals anyway. Go.
    537126|00000000||What are you doing?
    562331|00000000||Yen insisted on coming.
    537145|00000000||Rita!
    562483|00000000||What have they done… ? When I get my hands on those whoresons…
    562485|00000000||I'll gladly help. If I live to see it.
    537146|00000000||I must take her from here. Immediately.
    537138|00000000||Funny… there was a time I'd have asked you not to do this…
    537139|00000000||No, you'd never have asked… You're too proud.
    537134|00000000||Yen, get Rita out of here.
    537135|00000000||Geralt…
    562396|00000000||Yenna, for once, don't argue with him…
    537132|00000000||I'll do it.
    560049|00000000||Rita! Síle?!
    562334|00000000||When I get my hands on the sons of bitches…
    537127|00000000||Yenna… I shan't make it…
    562366|00000000||Hold on, you must hold on.
    562386|00000000||Aaaargh!
    562367|00000000||I'm dying, Yenna. I'm a sorceress, let me die with dignity.
   1061450|00000000||What… What is this?
   1005986|00000000||Let us through.
   1006076|00000000||Got something to do up there. So just let us through.
   1006077|00000000||Hahaha!
   1006088|00000000||Heh, givin' me orders? You? A human?
   1005987|00000000||I passed the trial. Here's proof.
   1006070|00000000||Recognize it?
   1005988|00000000||The Defier's Oren.
   1006071|00000000||A death sentence.
   1005985|00000000||I passed the trial. Here's proof.
   1005980|00000000||Hm…
   1005981|00000000||What's your name, girl?
   1005982|00000000||What's yours?
   1005983|00000000||Hmm… Your name don't matter. Atop the peak you'll lose it and get another. You may go.
   1005984|00000000||And you?
    587712|00000000||You heard?! A mage uprising!
    588014|00000000||They've rioted in Deireadh!
    587713|00000000||Let 'em come!
    588020|00000000||They'll taste my blade!
    577264|00000000||Hard to find good guards these days…
    577265|00000000||Quiet, you'll wake them.
    577267|00000000||Wait here. I'll go inside, open the door for you.
    577315|00000000||Just keep the noise down.
    577269|00000000||Locked… gotta find another way in.
    577271|00000000||Quick, get in here.
    577273|00000000||Oughta let Ciri and the others in.
    577314|00000000||Gotta calm all the horses before they wake the guards.
    577317|00000000||*Whistles*
    577318|00000000||Finally!
   1043674|00000000||Aegar, keep a lookout. Ciri and I'll try to get inside.
   1043676|00000000||All right.
   1061345|00000000||Calm the horses. Aegar and I will open the door.
   1062165|00000000||Hah. Here's the key.
   1043679|00000000||Damn. Bolted from the inside.
   1043681|00000000||What're you doin' here? Sod off, vagrant… Folk're trying' to get some rest, see?
   1061865|00000000||Gotta find another way in.
   1011417|00000000||Locked. From the other side, looks like.
   1011418|00000000||Let's move on. Worry about this later.
   1058811|00000000||Vanity?
   1061206|00000000||Sure you weren't followed?
   1061208|00000000||Yeah.
    555539|00000000||What's that?
    550339|00000000||Uhh… nothing. A preliminary image.
    555568|00000000||What?
    555570|00000000||Stop interrupting! I have to focus.
   1048266|00000000||You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now…
    550355|00000000||That was the recent past. Anything might happen to her in Dijkstra's hands. Let's go.
    550356|00000000||Not so fast. The first image… What was that?
    555634|00000000||Nothing, really.
    550357|00000000||Don't brush me off. I know how hydromancy works. Image appeared because you're thinking about it.
    555657|00000000||It was… King Tancred asked me to become his court advisor, in Kovir.
    555662|00000000||You turned him down, of course.
    555683|00000000||Did you accept?
    555721|00000000||Only a fool would refuse.
    555692|00000000||Generous offer. Hope you took it.
    555663|00000000||Hope you agreed.
    555756|00000000||The house - what was that?
    555661|00000000||What did you say?
    555684|00000000||Huh. Hope you turned him down…
    555699|00000000||I didn't… I said yes.
    555701|00000000||Triss… These last few months, they've really taught you nothing?
    555704|00000000||Tancred's been supportive of the mages from the start. The evacuation was only possible with his help!
    555707|00000000||Now he wants to revive the Council and the Conclave. And I'm to head both.
    555728|00000000||Any idea what you're getting yourself into?
    555783|00000000||It's a great opportunity… Congratulations…
    555786|00000000||You don't exactly sound thrilled…
    555758|00000000||Bit worried, that's all. You really ready to dive into politics again?
    555772|00000000||I wasn't sure at first… Ultimately, though, it's something I've always dreamed of.
    555773|00000000||The dreams' within reach now. I'm not about to let it go.
    555730|00000000||Congratulations, you'll be great.
    555779|00000000||You deserve it. Best decision Tancred ever made.
    555781|00000000||Thank you. I hope I can rise to the task.
    555789|00000000||You will. With you leading it, the Council might actually do some good, start helping people.
    555808|00000000||King of Kovir - what's his motive?
    555800|00000000||Tancred's picked a strange battle… All the North's hunting down mages, and he's out to revive the Council?
    555809|00000000||These are troubled times, and Tancred could be alone in remembering that mages are a powerful force.
    555813|00000000||And that we know how to show gratitude.
    555727|00000000||What was that house?
    555815|00000000||The vision was of a house, not a royal court…
    555817|00000000||It's the house that awaits us in Pont Vanis.
    555819|00000000||When we're done here, when all this is over, once we've defeated the Hunt and Ciri's safe, I'd like us to live there. Together.
    555834|00000000||I'm… surprised… Don't really know what to say…
    555835|00000000||You don't need to decide right away.
    555843|00000000||But I'm glad you know. I was afraid how you'd react. It's a big deal, resettling, to a permanent home.
    555841|00000000||If you don't want this, I'll turn it down. What I really want is to be with you, to.. to be together and…
    555845|00000000||Triss?
    555847|00000000||Yes?
    555849|00000000||We'll be together. And you don't need to turn anything down.
    555822|00000000||Have to think about it.
    555869|00000000||I'm not asking you to sacrifice anything. You're not cut out to be a courtier, I know that…
    555874|00000000||You can set out on the Path whenever you want, for however long you want…
    555880|00000000||It's just… you'll have somewhere to come home to.
    555885|00000000||Always used to be Kaer Morhen… House in your vision looks a lot cozier…
   1048261|00000000||We talked about this, remember? In the lighthouse.
    555851|00000000||I dunno, Triss…
    555867|00000000||The life of a witcher, it's no fairytale. But I like being on the Path, sleeping under the stars, waking up with dew on my face…
    555823|00000000||A witcher's life for me.
    555821|00000000||Of course.
    555825|00000000||Guess you've got everything planned out…
    555827|00000000||You don't like it?
    555830|00000000||I like it. A lot.
    555939|00000000||Ha… I'll tell you the details later. Right now we need to get Philippa.
    555941|00000000||Right.
    555983|00000000||Come on.
    556003|00000000||Let's go to the bathhouse, might not be too late.
    555990|00000000||Bathhouse. Let's go.
    555981|00000000||Was that the past or the future?
    555995|00000000||Was that the past or the future?
    556000|00000000||The recent past. We have to hurry.
    550334|00000000||Greame et dwyr! Deagnis cair-lle ess pyr'shena a et cleytte!
    550335|00000000||Looks familiar… A bathhouse. I know the place.
    550336|00000000||Dijkstra!
    550337|00000000||He has her. At his bathhouse.
    555626|00000000||Might've guessed as much.
    555400|00000000||Let's begin.
    555402|00000000||Observe the water's surface carefully. We can't let anything go unnoticed.
    550242|00000000||Greame et dwyr! Rhobeir'me gelle a failte!
   1061285|00000000||We're here.
   1061288|00000000||Nice and quiet. Shouldn't be any disturbances.
    579853|00000000||That was wrong.
    579905|00000000||Glad to see you happy… But I don't think what we did was right.
    579910|00000000||How can you keep the company of such a bore?
    579912|00000000||Leave him alone, Aegar. That's just how Geralt is - righteous.
    579944|00000000||Thanks for your help. And for visiting.
    579949|00000000||It was so good to see you all again. Hang in there and take care of yourselves.
    579951|00000000||Don't forget us. So long.
    579964|00000000||I must bid Valdo farewell.
    579952|00000000||All right. See you at Dandelion's, then. Got some things to take care of in town.
    579970|00000000||See you, Geralt.
    579903|00000000||Yeah… A nice change from killing monsters.
    579852|00000000||Sure was.
    577331|00000000||Whooo-hooo! We did it!
    577332|00000000||Excellent work! Did you see the two fools who tried to chase us?
    579899|00000000||Almost tripped over their own boots!
    579849|00000000||Thanks, Geralt, that was splendid!
   1055188|e87aca57||Prison Warden
   1124126|00000000||Worked out nicely, don't you think?
   1124128|00000000||What're you talking about?
   1124130|00000000||You and Triss. Never expected it, to be honest.
   1124132|00000000||Life's full of surprises.
   1124134|00000000||So, how did the two of you--?
   1124136|00000000||End up together?
   1124138|00000000||Hmm. With Yen it was fight after fight, lots of arguments, drama… Not saying it was bad, but…
   1124158|00000000||But what?
   1124141|00000000||Got to be exhausting. With Triss, it's not. I finally feel…  harmony. A calm. Feel like things are the way they're supposed to be.
   1124145|00000000||You know… perhaps it's not my concern, but… I'm glad you and Yennefer have ended up together.
   1124147|00000000||Me too.
   1124149|00000000||You took your time.
   1124151|00000000||Hm. Guess we both needed a while to grapple with it.
   1124153|00000000||So what was it like? You know, when the wish lost its hold. What did you feel?
   1124161|00000000||Hmm. Well, there we were, the two of us, on the mountain top. I looked at her, and…
   1124162|00000000||And felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. At long last.
    537215|00000000||More wine?
    537216|00000000||Thanks.
    537217|00000000||I'm glad we stayed.
    537218|00000000||Me too.
    537219|00000000||They like you here.
    537224|00000000||I like them, too. Ahh, I'd love to join them…
    558985|00000000||Drink and race, travel from town to town. Not worry a whit about anything…
    558989|00000000||What's worrying you now?
    559015|00000000||Something worrying you now?
    559018|00000000||Ahh… What awaits us.
    559034|00000000||Defeating the Hunt won't be easy, but with the Lodge's support, Avallac'h's… We can do this.
    559006|00000000||Good plan. Think I'll go with you.
    559021|00000000||Then our future's settled.
    559044|00000000||If, that is, there's more than ash left of us once this is over.
    558988|00000000||Good plan.
    558990|00000000||Need to defeat the Hunt first.
    559020|00000000||Hmm… Fairytale life… but we gotta defeat the Wild Hunt first.
    559025|00000000||I fear fighting the Hunt will only be the beginning. For me, at least.
    559065|00000000||Don't worry about that yet. One thing at a time.
    559058|00000000||You do know you can always count on me, whatever happens?
    559062|00000000||I do. Thank you, Geralt.
    559051|00000000||One thing at a time.
    559064|00000000||You worry too much. What will be, will be.
    559052|00000000||What will be will be.
    559050|00000000||What do you mean?
    559056|00000000||What do you mean?
    559084|00000000||Hahaha!
    559132|00000000||You promised!
    559134|00000000||In jest!
    559074|00000000||Sometimes I wish I could be like them.
    559185|00000000||Meaning?
    559194|00000000||Ordinary.
    559144|00000000||Meaning?
    559187|00000000||Me too. Being a witcher's a burden sometimes…
    559282|00000000||As is my "inheritance." I'd so like to be ordinary.
    559145|00000000||I get you.
    559143|00000000||Drunk?
    559183|00000000||Drunk or giggly? Whichever it is, today's your chance.
    559189|00000000||Haha, not what I meant.
    559197|00000000||I'd like to be ordinary.
    559287|00000000||Your life is yours, exclusively. You choose who you are.
    559289|00000000||Geralt, you know that's never been true.
    559281|00000000||You choose who you are.
    559280|00000000||You were born to great things.
    559285|00000000||Problem is, you're not. You were born to greatness.
    559293|00000000||As I've been hearing since I was born.
    559261|00000000||All because of this damned Elder Blood! My gift - my curse.
    559270|00000000||It granted me all of these powers, but it's also why I've spent my life fleeing, hiding.
    559461|00000000||Can always renounce a gift, turn it down…
    559462|00000000||It's not that easy. I tried once, remember?
    559475|00000000||Besides, even if doing that were to free me of Eredin, there will always be those with some kind of plan that includes me.
    559459|00000000||Gifts can be renounced…
    559380|00000000||We'll defeat Eredin. You'll be free.
    559290|00000000||Then it's time to end this. Once we defeat Eredin, you'll be free.
    559207|00000000||Really? Eredin's hardly alone. There are others, they have plans for me.
    559300|00000000||It was the sorceresses of the Lodge once, now it's my father, even Yennefer…
    559306|00000000||You're forgetting Avallac'h…
    559307|00000000||Avallac'h's different…
    559324|00000000||He is intent on my gift not falling into the wrong hands, not spinning out of control. It's why he teaches me, protects me.
    559328|00000000||The sooner you get rid of that illusion, the better.
    559329|00000000||What do you mean?
    559309|00000000||Don't be naive.
    559308|00000000||Hope you're right.
    559321|00000000||If you say so…
    559326|00000000||You doubt it?
    559344|00000000||There'll come a day when Avallac'h will ask you for a favor.
    559348|00000000||Perhaps… But if so, it will be a very, very long time from now…
    559350|00000000||And I'm certain whatever it is, he'll give me a choice. I will have the option to refuse.
    559351|00000000||Hope you're right…
    577174|00000000||That's Pablo. I plan to learn how to juggle one day.
    579351|00000000||Incredibly useful skill.
    579395|00000000||Finally found you two! Enjoying yourselves?
    579404|00000000||We were. Until someone interrupted us.
    579423|00000000||Rather prickly, this friend of yours.
    579428|00000000||You've much in common.
    579430|00000000||How did you fare with the merchant?
    579397|00000000||No.
    579406|00000000||I'd rather know how you fared with the merchant. Manage to get some horses?
    579398|00000000||Get the horses?
    579396|00000000||Yes.
    579402|00000000||Bonfires, wine, jugglers… What more could you ask for?
    579426|00000000||I can name a few things I'd trade it for, but it's a life…
    579455|00000000||You seem concerned. Things not go well with the merchant?
    579478|00000000||Bah, lost cause. The man refused to trade, I said I'd buy, he asked three arms and a host of legs for one healthy animal.
    579495|00000000||We need horses. But we'll have to find another way to get them…
    579530|00000000||Ho-ho, I sense trouble…
    579532|00000000||I knew you'd warm to the notion.
    579541|00000000||We mean to sneak into the man's stable. With thirty head, a few more or less won't make a difference in his life.
    579547|00000000||Coming with?
    579554|00000000||Of course!
    579579|00000000||Can't just buy them?
    579581|00000000||Just buy the horses. Why can't you?
    579583|00000000||With what coin?
    579598|00000000||Ciri gave you a full pouch…
    579600|00000000||Enough for one at most. Whereas at the least we need four.
    579602|00000000||Geralt, stop fussing. We'll not strip the merchant bare, and it's finally a chance to do something other than run from the Wild Hunt!
    579618|00000000||Don't make us beg!
    586097|00000000||You've convinced me.
    577198|00000000||Ehh, what can I do? Gotta help those in need…
    577199|00000000||Yes, yes, yes!
    577200|00000000||Must say, you didn't seem the type to me…
    579627|00000000||What type?
    579629|00000000||Steady. Time to go! We'll meet by the stables.
    577195|00000000||Let's steal some horses.
   1058973|00000000||None of this concerns us.
   1058976|00000000||This does concern me. These are my friends.
   1058979|00000000||They'll manage on their own.
   1058981|00000000||If Ciri wishes to ride with us, she should. She's not your property.
   1058983|00000000||I won't let her risk her neck for thieves.
    577196|00000000||Not about to steal.
    585949|00000000||Buy 'em for you.
    586015|00000000||Gotta be another way to solve this…
    586070|00000000||Just so happens I got some coin I could lend you.
    586017|00000000||We'd have no way to repay you.
    586019|00000000||Wouldn't have to.
    586063|00000000||Shame the emperor doesn't have another daughter. We could buy all the horses in Novigrad.
    586026|00000000||A generous offer, but not one to resolve this situation.
    586028|00000000||The merchant didn't object to our coin, he objected to us. "I'll not trade with such scum" - believe those were his words.
    586094|00000000||And if he'll not trade, we've no choice but to steal from him.
    586098|00000000||Don't like this idea.
    586100|00000000||I dunno. Doesn't seem like the best idea…
    172316|3a2616f8||Witch Hunter
    528874|00000000||Stand back! You'll all get a look soon enough!
    528875|00000000||Slag'll stay there till she rots!
    546562|00000000||You're here, finally.
   1059364|00000000||What do we do?
   1059366|00000000||You've got to approach the guards. I… they could recognize me, I'd rather not show my face.
   1059368|00000000||Right. You stay here.
    546561|00000000||Two guards left. Now or never.
   1075039|00000000||Not just yet. We should wait until nightfall.
    576140|00000000||You killed her! You killed our sister!
    576142|00000000||You'll regret that!
    538331|00000000||Aaaaah…
    538335|00000000||I feel two hundred years younger.
    538337|00000000||Bring the meat.
    536366|00000000||Aaooh…
    536367|00000000||More meat.
    538325|00000000||I feel two hundred years younger.
    576141|00000000||She killed our sister!
    537173|00000000||Heheh. Tomb raider. Seems this one liked elven stuff…
    545696|00000000||Gotta be kidding me…
   1060569|00000000||Damn. Forgot the wine.
   1061348|00000000||Hmm… Try a merchant nearby…?
   1054110|00000000||This is it.
   1058650|00000000||Hmm… Maybe oughta let her unwind?
    537179|00000000||Wet clothes… Oh joy…
    545655|00000000||Damn, lots of pops in the air.
    565211|00000000||Need a dose of the antidote.
    560366|00000000||No one in particular.
    560390|00000000||Nobody important.
    560415|00000000||I'd gladly put you up for the night. Could use a "nobody" like you…
    560365|00000000||A defender of the downtrodden.
    560369|00000000||A defender of the downtrodden.
    560375|00000000||Mmm… Just so happens I was just trodden upon head to toe. Perhaps you'd be kind enough to help me recover?
    560377|00000000||Bea, you strumpet, control yourself! This is Geralt!
    560378|00000000||Ah. Aha! Why didn't you say so to start with?
    560418|00000000||Ciri, get to the point.
    560451|00000000||Ciri, didn't you have something to take care of?
    560457|00000000||Right.
    560467|00000000||So, what brings you here, darlings?
    560469|00000000||I wanted to thank you. For everything.
    560470|00000000||Oh, stop! Anyone would've done the same in my shoes!
    560475|00000000||Not many would have done it with such courage. Thank you.
    571144|00000000||This is for you. A trinket, to remember me by.
    560477|00000000||Oh my, it's beautiful! Thank you. So? Will you stay for stew? Innkeep slaughtered a piglet this morning.
    560484|00000000||Thanks, but we must still visit Farcorners.
    560498|00000000||Ahh, off to see Valdo, eh? Well, shan't stop you, then. They'll feed you properly there too, no doubt.
    560486|00000000||Farewell to you both. And do take care of her, witcher.
    560499|00000000||I will. So long.
    560420|00000000||Really? What, for example?
    560421|00000000||For example, how you've saved her from woe so many times she's lost count. And how you always know how to make her laugh.
    560438|00000000||That's Ciri, of course. Other ladies, however…
    560448|00000000||Bea, I'm standing right here.
    560452|00000000||All right, all right.
    560417|00000000||What've you heard?
    560383|00000000||Mh-- Very nice to meet you. I've heard so much.
    560386|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    560388|00000000||THAT Geralt?
    560364|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
    545034|00000000||Thank you. They seemed more determined this time.
    545035|00000000||Shouldn't cross them, I told you.
    560355|00000000||I'm to bar nonhumans from this establishment because some thugs threaten me? Not likely!
    560357|00000000||So good to see you, Bea.
    545036|00000000||And you, Ciri. Who's your charming companion?
    536564|00000000||We did it.
    540336|00000000||Barely. How'd it go down there?
    540338|00000000||I slew only two of the Crones.
    588426|00000000||The third fled… with Vesemir's medallion. My sole memento.
    588652|00000000||Coming here? Good idea.
    588654|00000000||I knew we'd succeed. From the start.
    588645|00000000||Good idea to come here.
    588648|00000000||You avenged Vesemir.
    588650|00000000||Avallac'h claims vengeance is only ever satisfying when served cold. He's wrong.
    588644|00000000||You avenged Vesemir.
    588646|00000000||We were lucky, very lucky.
    588656|00000000||We got lucky this time. Hope it stays with us.
    588658|00000000||It's not luck. You're a professional killer, and I'm a chip off the old block.
   1013517|00000000||So, off to Novigrad, then?
    540360|00000000||Not quite yet.
    540364|00000000||Gimme a minute. I'm old, need more rest.
    581166|00000000||Hm. You are and you do.
    581168|00000000||Let's stay a bit longer.
   1050802|00000000||Gimme a minute. I'm old, need more rest.
   1050806|00000000||Let's stay a bit longer.
   1050800|00000000||Not quite yet.
   1050799|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
   1050818|00000000||Yeah, let's get going.
   1050824|00000000||Let's go.
    540362|00000000||Yeah, let's get going.
    581161|00000000||Thank you - for coming with me.
    581163|00000000||C'mere.
    588674|00000000||Heh, let's go.
    540359|00000000||Yeah, let's go.
    588660|00000000||Now to find Eredin and kill him.
    588663|00000000||An oren for your thoughts.
    588665|00000000||Wondering what to tell Yennefer when we get to Novigrad.
    588667|00000000||Tell her the truth. Always.
    588670|00000000||I wonder if Triss and Yennefer have found the sorceresses of the Lodge.
    588672|00000000||We ought to rejoin them.
    545562|00000000||Perty birdy… Good stink…
    570971|00000000||I am your master now. You're to protect me, understood?
    570972|00000000||Bart standunder.
    560567|00000000||Stand here - and let no one pass!
    560569|00000000||Bart herestand. None pastgo.
    557230|00000000||We need to go to Temple Isle.
    557231|00000000||Don't remember you being religious…
    557612|00000000||Nor am I now. Let's go.
    557232|00000000||We'll start with the Bits.
    557233|00000000||Who're we gonna visit?
    557493|00000000||You'll see…
    557227|00000000||Lead the way.
    557225|00000000||Sure, let's go.
    557508|00000000||No problem, I'll wait here.
    557516|00000000||In that case I'll await you there - the market in Gildorf.
    557234|00000000||Love to accompany you, but I gotta do something first.
    557226|00000000||Gotta do something first.
    557446|00000000||When I was last in Novigrad I had my share of troubles…
    557833|00000000||So I heard.
    557376|00000000||A few people helped me then, others… not so much. Now I mean to repay them both.
    557377|00000000||Coming with?
    557304|00000000||Couldn't help it. Grew curious about this "little matter" you have to resolve.
    557501|00000000||Can we go?
    557499|00000000||One of the people I told you about… A gesture of gratitude.
    557237|00000000||Looking for something in particular?
    557238|00000000||Hmm. A pretty little trinket…
    557444|00000000||Wanna give someone a present?
    557525|00000000||Ready?
    553345|00000000||Yen figure anything out about Rita?
    553358|00000000||Know what Yen's found out?
    553361|00000000||You'll need to ask her, I've been busy trying to find Philippa.
    527056|00000000||Greetings, Triss.
    527057|00000000||Have you lost your mind?! You went after Imlerith by yourselves?! To the sabbath?!
    552810|00000000||How could you put Ciri in danger?!
    552813|00000000||We had to do it.
    552855|00000000||Ciri had to do it. I couldn't let her go alone.
    552865|00000000||You'd have done the same in my boots.
    552861|00000000||Besides, I'd never let anything happen to Ciri. You know that.
    552829|00000000||But it didn't. I was there. Had the situation under control.
    552840|00000000||Mind if we change the subject?
    552858|00000000||Besides, I was there the whole time. Had the situation under control.
    552842|00000000||Shouldn't have… I'm sorry.
    552850|00000000||It ended well, luckily. But it didn't have to.
    552852|00000000||I know. But Imlerith's gone. That's what matters.
    552812|00000000||Sorry, shouldn't have.
    552811|00000000||Calm down. It went well.
    552823|00000000||Come on, we came out of it fine. Can't say the same for Imlerith.
    552825|00000000||That's the sole comfort I find in this. But it's no justification.
    552826|00000000||You know what might've happened?
    552831|00000000||Yeah. But I'd never let Ciri come to any harm. You know that.
    553503|00000000||Passed a unit of witch hunters on the way in.
    553517|00000000||Town's decked in Radovid's colors. And we passed a sizable force of witch hunters on the way in.
    553541|00000000||Novigrad's a lost cause. Unless by some miracle the emperor takes the city.
    554344|00000000||Hm, never thought of mages as fond of Emhyr.
    554345|00000000||Better predictable Emhyr and his semblance of freedom than crazy Radovid, brimming with hatred for anything even remotely related to magic.
    570839|00000000||Passed some pyres on the way in. Nonhumans.
    570840|00000000||Passed burning pyres on the way into town. Nonhumans on them.
    570849|00000000||Things grow worse by the day. No mages left in the city, so the hunters had to find someone else to victimize.
    570853|00000000||We need to resolve everything as quickly as possible and leave Novigrad.
    552869|00000000||Any success summoning members of the Lodge?
    552892|00000000||Any success with the Lodge? Anyone out there willing to help?
    552897|00000000||It doesn't look good… Ida outright refused, while Francesca won't budge from her little realm with a war raging.
    552943|00000000||We don't know about Fringilla. Haven't been able to contact her.
    553150|00000000||Keira was seen in Velen at one point. No word of her since. She could be dead…
    553136|00000000||You can count Keira out…
    553174|00000000||I sincerely hope we can contact Philippa and Rita in time.
   1059257|00000000||What about Philippa?
    553304|00000000||And I hope things work out for us, and we find Philippa and Rita.
    553179|00000000||Keira… thought too much of her charm. Tried to buy her way into Radovid's graces, offered to make a powerful weapon for him…
    553185|00000000||I tried to talk her out of it, but she refused to listen…
    554482|00000000||Radovid laughed in her face, ordered her captured, then… impaled. Nothing I could do…
    553208|00000000||Keira played with fire. Had to know she might get burned.
    553210|00000000||Singed hands, maybe… but impaled?
    553193|00000000||Had it coming.
    554488|00000000||Don't blame yourself. Keira wasn't one to listen to reason.
    554486|00000000||Don't blame yourself.
    553192|00000000||Didn't deserve that.
    553198|00000000||Just his style… Coulda had her hanged, decapitated - even a burning pyre would've been a quicker death.
    553206|00000000||He wanted to watch her suffer…
    553215|00000000||Before we leave, we have to bury her. I won't let crows pick her rotting flesh off a stake.
    553217|00000000||I can do that much, at least…
    553224|00000000||Guards'll hand over the body given the proper incentive.
    553254|00000000||I really hope we contact Philippa and Rita - before they meet a similar fate.
   1059268|00000000||I hope we can reach Philippa before she meets a similar fate.
   1059259|00000000||Did a little investigating, learned some interesting things.
   1059253|00000000||Namely?
   1059255|00000000||Want the long or the short version?
   1059247|00000000||Damn shame Keira won't be here to help…
   1059251|00000000||True, but there's still a chance we'll find Philippa.
   1059245|00000000||What about Keira and Philippa?
   1059241|00000000||Yen and I rescued Margarita.
   1059243|00000000||I know. Dandelion set her up in a room upstairs. She's resting, slowly recovering.
    553137|00000000||And the others? Keira? Margarita? Philippa?
    553142|00000000||Keira?
    553148|00000000||I thought you of all people'd know…
    553297|00000000||I've seen worse matches… Hope things work out for them.
   1059261|00000000||I hope they work out for us, and we actually find Philippa and Rita.
    553325|00000000||We will. We have to.
    553329|00000000||I'll rest easier when they're both here, with us.
    553188|00000000||Don't worry, we will.
    553187|00000000||Where are Philippa and Margarita?
    553319|00000000||Know where they are?
    553323|00000000||Yennefer's looking into Rita's whereabouts. I have to figure out where Philippa is.
    553344|00000000||Learned anything about Philippa?
    553363|00000000||So, learn anything?
    554349|00000000||A few things that could be interesting. Prefer the long version or the short?
    554354|00000000||Guess.
    554357|00000000||In short, she was here, at this inn, under our noses the whole time. Transformed, seated on her perch, with a dimeritium band on her leg.
    554359|00000000||Zoltan's owl?
    554361|00000000||Mhm.
    554362|00000000||So why isn't she here anymore?
    554365|00000000||Because Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago.
    554350|00000000||Short, to the point.
    554351|00000000||Long. Wanna know the details.
    554352|00000000||Tell me everything. I want the details.
    553364|00000000||After fleeing Loc Muinne Philippa ended up here in Novigrad. She sought help from her former lover - the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester.
    570878|00000000||De Vleester? Rings a bell…
    553407|00000000||Philippa and a former lover? Something tells me "happily ever after" is not how that story ends.
    553411|00000000||Philippa'd made a fool of him once. Arthur was out for revenge. He convinced her she'd be safest as an owl. She transformed, and he placed a dimeritium band on her leg.
    553416|00000000||The mage hunts started shortly afterwards. Sadly, Arthur fell victim. They auctioned off his estate.
    553417|00000000||Just so happens a certain dwarven acquaintance of ours stumbled on the auction…
    553418|00000000||Zoltan. Huh. So Philippa was here, under our noses, the whole time?
    553419|00000000||"Was" - precisely. Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago.
    553466|00000000||Yup. That's Zoltan for you…
    553452|00000000||Figures.
    553451|00000000||No way.
    553460|00000000||Kidding, right?
    553464|00000000||Sadly, no.
    553473|00000000||A man showed up here, fleeced Zoltan bare, then proposed they play for the owl.
    564428|00000000||Naturally, he won. Then politely thanked Zoltan for the game and left.
    553475|00000000||Who was it? Know where he lives?
    553476|00000000||He's not from here. No one knows him.
    553482|00000000||Great. We got any leads?
    553485|00000000||We have this.
    553488|00000000||That Philippa the owl's feather? Thinking divination?
    553489|00000000||Specifically, hydromancy and a form of sortilege. We need a fountain where we won't be disturbed.
    553612|00000000||I'm back.
    553614|00000000||Great, let's go find the fountain.
    554371|00000000||Need to take care of something first. Meet you somewhere later?
    554373|00000000||Fine. The fountain outside the Passiflora. And… hurry, please.
    553550|00000000||Meet you somewhere later.
    553602|00000000||Don't you think we oughta get Keira first?
    553603|00000000||Hmm… Right…
    553607|00000000||Meet you on the main square at night.
    553551|00000000||Let's get Keira first.
    553549|00000000||Let's go now.
    553615|00000000||One outside the Passiflora could work…
    555358|00000000||Good idea. Let's go.
   1042034|00000000||Die, mutant!
   1074624|00000000||Imlerith's at the summit, gotta be.
    332382|00365006||Bandit
   1074087|00000000||The last of the chosen'll now ascend the mount to the peak, to meet the Ladies!
   1074089|00000000||Let the festivities begin! And let them last till the crack of dawn!
   1060975|00000000||It's not ready. You've got to wait.
    558491|00000000||Here and there…
    558495|00000000||Went to Kaer Morhen first, then Velen…
    564308|00000000||Leave 'em alone, Zoltan. Can't you see they're beat?
    526562|00000000||Anything interesting happen?
    526564|00000000||Anything happen while we were away?
    526565|00000000||Uh, Pretty Polly came down with a fever, Matt Oyster caught a knife between the ribs, and they're late delivering the Sodden triple mead…
    551837|00000000||Dandelion…
    532479|00000000||Thanks, see you.
    532558|00000000||Thanks. Looks like I'll have my hands full…
    532486|00000000||Gave him your best room?
    551809|00000000||He didn't exactly ask.
    532488|00000000||I'd prepared another room for him, but he blew past me and locked himself in the Ruby.
    532556|00000000||Hasn't peeked out since. Barely eats, drinks only water, and the only thing I've heard from him is, "I wish to know when Gwynbleidd and Zireael arrive."
    532478|00000000||Gave him your best room?
    585634|00000000||Lodge of Sorceresses - Triss and Yen were supposed to gather the remnants.
    529671|00000000||They're working on it. Triss is upstairs, waiting for you. Yennefer's gone to Crippled Kate's.
    551810|00000000||Yen? At that portside dive? Why?
    529673|00000000||Didn't inform me. Imagine that.
    529674|00000000||Ah, and that elf of yours moved into the Ruby Suite. Told me to tell you he's waiting, too.
    532326|00000000||Anyone here besides us?
    526561|00000000||The sorceresses - where are they?
    531723|00000000||In fact, you look terrible! Like you could really use some rest!
    526559|00000000||Gladly take some. Point me to a room.
    531726|00000000||Course. Come on, little swallow, I'll take ye.
    531750|00000000||Let's meet later, Geralt. I've a little matter to resolve. I'll freshen up, then await you in the square in Gildorf.
    557297|00000000||Right.
    531745|00000000||Just finished hunting down the Crones of Velen and a general of the Wild Hunt.
    531747|00000000||Well, you've had a busy morn, then, haven't you…
    558490|00000000||Imlerith - we hunted him down.
    531719|00000000||Dandeeelion! Ready some tankards! We've guests.
    526558|00000000||Geralt! Ciri!
    570817|00000000||When I learned Geralt had found you--
    570830|00000000||Glad you to see you in one piece, too, Dandelion.
    570832|00000000||Where've you two been?
   1012952|00000000||Way back when, did you really send assassins after Dijkstra?
   1012953|00000000||You believe I…? Do you not remember we were once lovers?
   1020981|00000000||Maybe it's just me, but I think you'd consider that in itself to be reason enough. Actually, I've long wondered why you parted. Quarelled, even.
   1012954|00000000||Ahh, you see, Geralt, there are those who keep politics separate from their private lives, and those who do not.
   1012955|00000000||Which one was Dijkstra?
   1012956|00000000||The more boring of the two.
   1012951|00000000||Did you really want Dijkstra killed?
   1012949|00000000||Farewell.
   1012914|00000000||Farewell.
   1012939|00000000||Where's Saskia nowadays?
   1012941|00000000||Where's Saskia now? She manage to free herself of your spell?
   1012942|00000000||I lost control of her when the war broke out. I've no notion where she is.
   1021014|00000000||I know you used her, but… couldn't escape the impression that you actually cared for her in some way.
   1021016|00000000||Really?
   1012908|00000000||Well? What is it?
   1012909|00000000||No need to thank me, Philippa. Always glad to save your ass. You're welcome.
   1016623|00000000||You stood to gain - that is why you saved me.
   1012910|00000000||What do you want?
   1059871|00000000||Not this year, child.
   1059873|00000000||I so wished to see the Ladies…
   1062016|00000000||The gate'd be closed, I told ye clear.
   1062018|00000000||Thecla - we ought to go back to her, beg 'er.
   1062020|00000000||Twould be for naught.
   1059882|00000000||Goin' to see the Ladies? We'll go with yous!
   1059884|00000000||We'll do no such thing, child. The guard'll not let us pass.
   1062022|00000000||Tell the Ladies to descend, walk among us!
    536311|00000000||Four… Whore…
    538142|00000000||Five… Hive…
    536312|00000000||Six… mmm… Tricks…
    538145|00000000||Seven… Heaven…
    536313|00000000||Eight… Fate…
    538148|00000000||Nine… Swine…
    538150|00000000||Ten… Wren…
    538135|00000000||One… Bun…
    538137|00000000||Two… Poo…
    538139|00000000||Three… Glee…
   1021894|00000000||Twere a hard winter…
   1021896|00000000||Oak'll give plenty, don't ye fret.
   1021898|00000000||Gave but four the year past…
   1021900|00000000||Me grandmother said they came down the mount just afore daybreak.
   1021902|00000000||How did they look?
   1021904|00000000||At once beauty and horror - like an army in full regalia.
   1013558|00000000||Tally-ho!
   1059025|00000000||Oh, hell. I guess I must jump.
   1013539|00000000||Imlerith is dangerous, I'll take care of him.
   1013541|00000000||Imlerith's a bigger threat than the Crones. I should face him.
   1013543|00000000||I'm no worse a fighter than you.
   1013545|00000000||We both know that's not true. Listen to me this once.
   1013547|00000000||But--
   1013549|00000000||No buts.
   1013551|00000000||Fine. Be careful.
   1013553|00000000||You too.
    588603|00000000||Out of the question. I'll climb the mountain, you face the Crones.
    588605|00000000||Hardly a challenge.
    588607|00000000||They're extremely dangerous. Be careful.
    588609|00000000||You too.
   1013538|00000000||Fate has decided.
    575999|00000000||One tough son of a bitch.
    576000|00000000||We've no time to lose. I'll tend to Imlerith, you take the Crones. Avallac'h said they dwell below the oak, among its roots.
    576206|00000000||No chance. I'm going after Imlerith.
    576208|00000000||Fine, let's play for it - rock, paper, scissors.
   1013537|00000000||Dammit! Two out of three.
    551797|00000000||It's changed a bit since I last left.
    545161|00000000||Radovid's growing bolder.
    545162|00000000||They say whoever takes Novigrad will take the North.
    545166|00000000||A free city, full of riches - tempting prize.
    534714|00000000||Hah! Mistake, you rat!
    558958|00000000||Argh!
    559936|00000000||Word is you been lettin' nonhumans in your tavern again!
    559940|00000000||I admit whomever I please! You don't scare me!
    559998|00000000||Sure we don't?
    570372|00000000||They're… nonhumans. Thought it was mages the hunters and the Temple Guard were after.
    570373|00000000||Mages left… hunters needed a new quarry.
    569284|00000000||Well? Get going!
   1042083|00000000||Ooooooow!
   1059164|00000000||Haven't you done enough? Leave me be!
    557813|00000000||Not what I thought I'd find…
    557816|00000000||He deserved this.
    557829|00000000||So there is justice in this world.
    557831|00000000||Come, let's see…
    546733|00000000||On the way here, I didn't know what I'd do. Killing him was definitely an option.
    546734|00000000||Still want to?
    546735|00000000||No. This is worse.
    546736|00000000||Let's go.
    546737|00000000||We've done the hardest part. Only the pleasant bits left now.
    557878|00000000||Where're we going?
    557879|00000000||The Golden Sturgeon. A girl who works there helped me.
    546728|00000000||Who… who's there?
    557835|00000000||Remember me?
    546730|00000000||You… you cunt. You little arse-fucked whore! You… you'll pay for what you did to me!
    557854|00000000||I'd watch your words if I were you.
    557859|00000000||Wi-i-i-tche-e-r! It's all your fault! Happy, you cocksucker?!
    557868|00000000||I've naught left! Not a bloody scrap… of human dignity left!
    585667|00000000||Ow!
    585670|00000000||You little shit!
    557824|00000000||Wonder what happened to him.
    557827|00000000||We'll soon find out.
    557815|00000000||Wonder what happened to him…
   1011817|00000000||Sails are white as clouds, and the sea's sapphire blue and emerald green.
   1011819|00000000||The sea?
   1011821|00000000||A great big salty lake.
   1011823|00000000||Oh…
   1049228|00000000||Sails are white as clouds, and the sea's sapphire blue and emerald green.
    533175|00000000||You will not take me!
    533202|00000000||I wanna help you!
    533203|00000000||Hah! Forgive me, but I just don't believe you!
    554647|00000000||Meet me at night in the main square. We have to take care of Keira.
    554644|00000000||See you then.
    554648|00000000||Gonna be all right?
    557022|00000000||Yeah, thanks for your help.
    556981|00000000||Sorry to take so long, but I had to deal with the guards.
    556987|00000000||Hello, Triss.
    556989|00000000||Philippa, are you all right?
    556997|00000000||I've been better.
    533450|00000000||I'll get you out of here.
    535348|00000000||On form and fast as ever!
    535349|00000000||Good race.
    535350|00000000||Thanks. Truly swift, this mare.
    558795|00000000||The swiftest horse is worth no more than a mule without a good rider.
    558803|00000000||Still swift as the wind, Valdo.
    558808|00000000||Haven't raced anyone that good in a while.
    558810|00000000||Haha. You're worthy opponents, you gave me wings!
    549632|00000000||Well, this calls for a celebration! Stay the evening! We've several barrels of Kaedwen's best.
    558812|00000000||Bonfires to be lit soon round which all will gather! This night shall be ours!
    558797|00000000||Can still beat you.
    558799|00000000||I let you win.
    558801|00000000||Lovely race!
    562940|00000000||They don't bite.
    562952|00000000||Then talk to them. Not like they're out to bite you.
    562954|00000000||If they do, I'll bite back.
    562956|00000000||So what's the problem?
    562941|00000000||Not good.
    562958|00000000||Don't waste any time, do they. I don't like this.
    562960|00000000||Neither do I.
    546254|00000000||Not a conversation you're likely to avoid. I'll go with you if you want.
    546255|00000000||Hmm… They'll weigh their words more carefully with you there.
    562978|00000000||Wouldn't be so sure… But two heads're better than one.
    562984|00000000||Let's get this over with.
    546249|00000000||Going with you.
    562987|00000000||Got nothing to be afraid of. Just go, listen to what they have to say.
    562991|00000000||And if they try to force me into something?
    562994|00000000||Can't believe you'd ever let them.
    546258|00000000||Margarita's only ever cared about your education. Doubt she'll try to drag you into politics.
    563048|00000000||Philippa's tougher. Plays a mean game, but ultimately respects those who hold to their views.
    563067|00000000||If she makes you an offer, and you firmly turn it down, she'll respect that.
    563070|00000000||Thanks, Geralt.
    546259|00000000||Well, go. Don't give 'em any more time to strategize.
    546250|00000000||You'll do fine on your own.
    562962|00000000||I bet they have plans for me. And they're deigning to inform me of them.
    562948|00000000||They say about what?
    562950|00000000||No, but I have my suspicions.
    562939|00000000||What about?
    546241|00000000||Geralt!
    546243|00000000||What is it?
    546244|00000000||Nothing just yet, but something's afoot. Philippa and Margarita want to speak to me.
   1007887|00000000||Ye shan't meet the Ladies. Begone.
   1007886|00000000||But we... wo--
   1007885|00000000||Ayyye… None of ye is worthy. Begone.
   1084974|bc0c0990||Fire Elemental
   1059197|00000000||We should be going.
   1059199|00000000||Eager to see the Ladies. I share your yearnin'.
   1059201|00000000||We're afire with yearning. Come, Geralt, we must get there before daybreak.
   1059602|00000000||Go to the tent and stand before Thecla. She's the one who decides who's worthy to face the Ladies.
   1002738|00000000||We should go.
   1003626|00000000||Mentioned a gate. Said we wouldn't pass.
   1003983|00000000||Only the Chosen visit the Ladies. Every year young lads and lasses climb the mount, but never more than three.
   1004006|00000000||Let me guess - the young lads and lasses don't return.
   1004007|00000000||No, they return, happy and radiant. But rare is the one who then stays in Velen. Off they go to seek fortune in the wider world.
   1002278|00000000||This gate - why can't we get past it?
   1003627|00000000||Ladies of the Wood visit you?
   1003628|00000000||If they favor us. My father told me they descended once, passed from fire to fire, listenin' to hopes and grievances. So each year we wait for them to walk amongst us once more.
   1003984|00000000||Haven't done it in a long time, then.
   1003629|00000000||No point waiting to see if we'll get lucky.
   1003630|00000000||Yeah, we gotta try to reach the peak.
   1002279|00000000||The Ladies descend to you? What then?
   1002739|00000000||What's the feast celebrate?
   1002743|00000000||This celebration - what's it about?
   1003631|00000000||Why d'ye need to know, wanderer?
   1002744|00000000||No need for anger. The White One served the Ladies, as we do now.
   1002745|00000000||We send 'em gifts all year long, and on this night they repay us with their blessing.
   1002746|00000000||I met one of your gifts to the Crones - sniveling, scared to death, and about eight years old.
   1002747|00000000||Stay calm.
   1002749|00000000||The Ladies' blessing - what's that about?
   1002799|00000000||Said the Ladies bestow blessings on you…
   1002800|00000000||Aye, for our lives turn thus - first a summer of laborin' 'neath the hot sun, then autumn rains, then a winter of death.
   1002801|00000000||Then we await spring, when all that is dead is born anew. And from our blood and sweat the oak bears acorns - atimes few, atimes a handful.
   1002802|00000000||What do you do with the acorns?
   1002803|00000000||The Velen elders gather, hold council. Some favor grinding 'em to spread on the fields for a rich harvest. Others want 'em given to a cunning woman, who'd make medicine for consumption.
   1002804|00000000||A handful of enchanted acorns is enough for all Velen?
   1002805|00000000||Tis never enough.
   1002748|00000000||Why do the Ladies need your children?
   1002740|00000000||Your children - why do the Ladies need them?
   1002741|00000000||We know not and never ask.
   1002797|00000000||You don't know? Then let me tell you.
   1002742|00000000||Tell us instead what a peasant, his own young 'uns starvin', is to do with a wanderin' war orphan?
   1002798|00000000||You're not from here. Don't judge us by others' laws.
   1002750|00000000||Changing topics…
   1002751|00000000||Heard enough about this. We've got other questions.
   1002280|00000000||Let them approach.
   1002281|00000000||But…
   1002282|00000000||They've come for the feast. Wouldn't do to cast them out.
   1002285|00000000||Didn't come to celebrate. We need to get to the top of the mountain.
   1002286|00000000||The gate is shut - you'll not pass. But we've fires down thataway, with food and drink aplenty. Sit down beside one and perhaps this year the Ladies will descend, give us the privilege of seein' 'em.
   1004008|00000000||We won't join you at your fires, though we thank you for the invitation. Time we were on our way.
   1004009|00000000||You wish to see the Ladies. I, too, hope to, afore I die.
   1004010|00000000||Go up the mountain and face old Thecla. She'll decide if you're worthy.
   1004011|00000000||Do just that. Farewell.
   1059189|00000000||Time we were on our way.
   1059188|00000000||We'll sit down by a fire.
   1059191|00000000||We thank you for the invitation. Be glad to sit down, right?
   1059193|00000000||Speak for yourself.
   1059195|00000000||Come with me.
   1004005|00000000||You're back? Join us, we can await the Ladies' messengers together.
   1060721|00000000||That went smoothly.
   1059699|00000000||Weren't the one to do the diving in that cave.
   1059701|00000000||Stop whining. You're a witcher, you've dived in murkier waters.
   1060723|00000000||Yeah. Have to tell you about the time I hunted a zeugl.
    556275|00000000||Gotta avoid hurting her.
    533376|00000000||I'll never be imprisoned again! Never!
    533377|00000000||You shan't take me alive!
    533378|00000000||Triss is waiting by the exit!
    556252|00000000||We wanna get you outta here!
    533379|00000000||To surrender me to Radovid? I'd sooner die!
    533380|00000000||I'm not your enemy!
    556266|00000000||Came to ask for your help!
    557978|00000000||Damn rubble. Loud as a herd of rabid trolls.
    533375|00000000||What's happened? So quiet, all of a sudden?
   1042600|00000000||Aha! There you are!
   1042598|00000000||Go back! Leave me in peace!
   1013589|00000000||How was he?
   1013591|00000000||He lived a life of love, and knew no bitterness.
   1013593|00000000||Yum-yum.
    570999|00000000||I need her. Gotta catch her.
    571004|00000000||Birdy want no you her catch.
    556151|00000000||Get out of my way before things get unpleasant.
    556153|00000000||Bart no can do. Bart promise.
    556155|00000000||You asked for it.
    556144|00000000||I need her.
    556157|00000000||She's hurt, did you see that? I wanna help her.
    556159|00000000||Birdy no pastgo say. Bart no let pastgo.
    556161|00000000||Hmm… Ever had a stomach ache?
    556163|00000000||Hmm… Ache, aye. Bart once old drowner eat.
    556165|00000000||Her stomach aches like she just ate a hundred old drowners.
    556186|00000000||Bart no want… Drowner make ache very bad…
    556196|00000000||Let me pass. I can help her.
    556203|00000000||Hmm… Bart let pastgo… Witchar help.
    556145|00000000||I want to help her.
    545623|00000000||Witcher no pastgo. Perty birdy nosay.
    570980|00000000||Dammit, cast a spell on him too.
    545821|00000000||You were faster once!
    545822|00000000||Giving you a head start!
    545823|00000000||Faster! You're trailing!
    545824|00000000||Watch where you're going, or you'll fall!
    545825|00000000||Haha, seems you've slowed!
    549630|00000000||Just want to admire you from the side!
    571441|00000000||He was absolutely dreadful on stage.
    571433|00000000||But when he came to court me, he proved quite amusing.
    571435|00000000||This one time, for instance, he ate a wooden plate.
    571439|00000000||And? Did you yield?
    571442|00000000||Oh, don't scoff, it was touching!... In its own way…
    571445|00000000||But to bind myself to a dwarven clown - that's not for me.
    569302|00000000||Lovely mare.
    569303|00000000||Indeed, indeed.
    569305|00000000||Ehh, I suppose I must practice a bit…
    569310|00000000||Yolo was a magician, an illusionist. He'd always perform in a mask.
    571501|00000000||His choice act - sawing women from the audience in half.
    571533|00000000||The women would lie down in a crate, then he'd saw through it, right down the middle.
    571543|00000000||He'd separate the two halves, then push them back together, and the ladies would stand up intact.
    571505|00000000||But once… one didn't.
    571507|00000000||What? Why?
    571509|00000000||That day someone else donned his mask, grabbed a woman from the crowd, laid her in the crate, and…
    571510|00000000||We learned later the man was her cuckold, and this was his revenge.
    571564|00000000||And Yolo? What happened to him?
    571570|00000000||We found him bound in one of the wagons. He was fine, but we could never perform in the town again.
    569312|00000000||Ha! Who's the best now?!
    569307|00000000||Who would like more wine?
    571254|00000000||From here to the old willow!
    579194|00000000||Old Blue Eyes has a limp, and Marilyn's lost all her teeth.
    579196|00000000||We barely managed, even with them.
    579198|00000000||Hmm… We can't afford new horses.
    579200|00000000||Told you what we need to do.
    579202|00000000||And I told you we must find another way.
    586191|00000000||Forced out of Novigrad! What's the world coming to?
    586209|00000000||I'm glad we're leaving.
    586211|00000000||We must go before the guards come…
    586189|00000000||Ugh, the road again tomorrow…
    586187|00000000||Hm… Is that everything?
    558663|00000000||Stupid old goat!
    558664|00000000||You stink!
    558665|00000000||Bugger off… little shits.
    558774|00000000||What can you do?
    558777|00000000||Hahahaha!
    558667|00000000||Get outta here.
   1011348|00000000||Well I'll be, you're back!
   1011349|00000000||And I see you've found your lass!
   1011350|00000000||I'm Johnny - we've had the pleasure already, a bit one-sided though it was. See, I saw you runnin', your back to me, as I was, heh, havin' the pleasure of… 'Tis a long story.
   1011351|00000000||They call me Ciri. Nice to meet you.
   1011352|00000000||How're things, Johnny?
   1011353|00000000||Health's good, so no complaints. What brings you here?
   1011355|00000000||Why're you here?
   1011356|00000000||What're you doing here? Last we met, you and the Crones weren't exactly friends.
   1011357|00000000||I got an invitation I couldn't refuse - same as every year. In their peculiar way, the Crones tolerate my presence and wish to see me at their Sabbath…
   1011358|00000000||So I come, wander about, and go home with the rising sun. What about you?
   1011354|00000000||Looking for a path to the summit.
   1011359|00000000||We gotta climb the mountain. Can you help?
   1011360|00000000||I'd rather try to dissuade you, but I'm certain that would be in vain. The lass - she as stubborn as you?
   1011361|00000000||Even more so.
   1011362|00000000||Figured as much. Sigh. Path to the peak starts there, past the gate. But only old Thecla's got the key, so since you shan't ever get it, you'd best turn back now.
   1011364|00000000||Why won't we get the key?
   1011366|00000000||The key - why do you doubt we can get it?
   1011367|00000000||Good grief, you're worse than children!
   1011368|00000000||Three souls are allowed atop the mountain - and only strapping young lads or comely lasses among them. They get the key, open the gate and meet the Ladies.
   1011369|00000000||I believe I qualify.
   1011370|00000000||But he's old and ugly. What good is he?
   1011371|00000000||Pretty damned good at finding lost voices.
   1011372|00000000||Then go find the voice of reason. It'll tell you to turn back. There's no foolin' with the Ladies.
   1011365|00000000||The Crones got any guests?
   1011373|00000000||We're here to find an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks he might be a guest of the Crones.
   1011407|00000000||Big bloke, in full plate? Goin' the right way - he's atop the mountain all right.
   1011408|00000000||You've seen him?
   1011409|00000000||Saw him in the bog first. Water froze beneath his horse's hooves. Then I saw him again yesterday, heading up this path.
   1011410|00000000||Why're you looking for him?
   1011411|00000000||He killed my friend.
   1011412|00000000||Wouldn't seek revenge, if I were you. Even the Ladies bow and scrape before that one.
   1011363|00000000||We gotta try.
   1011464|00000000||Gotta get to the summit. Simple as that.
   1011465|00000000||It's Thecla you'll need to convince. She's blind as your bum, but she won't be fooled.
   1011466|00000000||We shan't try to trick her.
   1011467|00000000||She sits in that tent over yonder. I wish you luck and do hope we meet again… someday.
    569275|00000000||Philippa! Wait!
    569278|00000000||I'm not out to hurt you!
    569279|00000000||Bollocks!
    569281|00000000||I wanna help you!
    569282|00000000||Help me die?! Don't hold your breath!
    465459|c422f954||Grave Hag
   1059595|00000000||Loads of footprints. Crowd of peasants came through here.
    536517|00000000||Ghaarrr!
    536518|00000000||Raaaghr!
    536516|00000000||Arrrgh!
   1051202|00000000||What now?
   1051204|00000000||We go home…
   1051206|00000000||Ahh… Try again next year.
    569288|00000000||Geralt, there's no time. Follow her.
    587715|00000000||Tweren't mages at all, they say.
    588026|00000000||Who, then?
    588028|00000000||One man! Fought his way past the guards and fled!
    587716|00000000||You daft?
    588031|00000000||Deireadh's well-guarded. No tighter prison on the Continent.
    556897|00000000||Triss goes with me.
    556912|00000000||We're going together.
    556913|00000000||Not a chance.
    556914|00000000||It's fine, Geralt, I'll stay. In case she tries to flee this way.
    556931|00000000||Fine. Be right back.
    556898|00000000||Stay here, Triss. In case she tries to flee this way.
    556900|00000000||Be careful. She might be blind, but she's still dangerous.
    564529|00000000||And don't hurt her.
    556896|00000000||Fine.
    556053|00000000||Goddamn fools! After her!
    556062|00000000||We'll handle this.
    556064|00000000||Oh, no! No, no! The sorceress stays here.
    556021|00000000||Surrender!
    556030|00000000||This place is a maze, witch! You'll never get out!
    564854|00000000||Were you in on this?
    564926|00000000||You know about this?
    564928|00000000||No, they didn't tell me till this morning.
    564952|00000000||A shame, really, because it looks like you had a roaring good time.
    564932|00000000||I'll do a number on you…
    564936|00000000||Do a number on you if you don't…
    564938|00000000||In your shoes, my friend, I'd be promising mounds of gold, not making threats.
    564946|00000000||Untie me now, or you'll need that gold to replace your teeth.
    564951|00000000||Haha. You'd have to catch me first. And you don't exactly look like you're getting out of here anytime soon.
    564987|00000000||Got what I deserved.
    565001|00000000||Got what I deserved… Should've known it was too good to be true…
    565044|00000000||You certainly should have.
    564988|00000000||Don't wanna talk about it.
    565003|00000000||Tell anyone about this and…
    565046|00000000||Calm down, won't peep a word. It's one thing to laugh at a friend, another thing entirely to make a laughing stock of him.
    565069|00000000||I'm off to see Avallac'h. Wanted a word, apparently…
    565086|00000000||I'm going to the port. We should already be on our way to Skellige.
    565088|00000000||Well, take care of yourself, friend. And you're not sore about my teasing, are you?
    565090|00000000||No, I'm not. So long, Dandelion.
    565048|00000000||Oh, Geralt, how little you know about women… Did you really think you could have them both?
    565050|00000000||You have a great deal to learn… Glad to give you some advice if you want.
    565059|00000000||Think I'll pass.
    564998|00000000||Triss and Yen - where are they? Got something to say to them…
    564986|00000000||Triss and Yen will pay…
    564923|00000000||Dandelionnnn…
    564954|00000000||All right, all right. Sorry, don't often see you like this, couldn't resist…
    564985|00000000||So, how do you feel? A bit numb, I bet.
    564856|00000000||Save it. I'm not in the mood...
    564858|00000000||Well, I sure am. What'd you play?
    564859|00000000||"Tame the fiend?" Or was it "Free the prince?"
    564853|00000000||Save it.
    564292|00000000||Haha. Well, well. Ladies did quite a number on you.
   1012529|00000000||He the one who kicked you out of your house?
   1012616|00000000||Yes.
   1012617|00000000||Well, I must have a word with 'im.
   1012618|00000000||Don't hurt 'im!
   1012619|00000000||Who do you think you are? Kickin' Sarah outta her home - how could you?
   1012620|00000000||Wasn't her home, and besides--
   1012621|00000000||Please, it worked out in the end. If I'd not left Novigrad, I'd never 'ave met Johnny.
   1012634|00000000||Fine, I'll let you off this time.
   1012635|00000000||See you found your lass. So what brings you here?
   1012623|00000000||What're you doing here?
   1012629|00000000||What're you doing here? And how'd you two end up together?
   1012630|00000000||Got an invitation we couldn't refuse. Around the Sabbath the Ladies get nicer of a sudden. Or maybe they're just out to show me who's in charge?
   1012631|00000000||Did I hear right? You walked here all the way from Novigrad?
   1012632|00000000||Weren't no trouble for someone who talks to birds. A blackbird told me about Johnny, so I puttered over.
   1012622|00000000||Looking for a path up the mountain.
   1012624|00000000||We're heading up the mountain. Any advice?
   1012625|00000000||Yeah - don't do it. Johnny says the Crones aren't to be fooled with.
   1012626|00000000||You've barely found your lass. Didn't find her just to lose her now, did you?
   1012627|00000000||We'll be fine.
   1012628|00000000||Do as you will. Path up the mountain starts t'other side of the gate, so you'll need the key. Old Thecla only gives it to those she deems worthy of the Ladies' presence.
   1012667|00000000||The key - what's that about?
   1012697|00000000||Gate's locked? Why?
   1012698|00000000||Good grief, worse than children, these two.
   1012699|00000000||Durin' each Sabbath the Crones demand to meet three beautiful youngsters. Old Thecla picks 'em and gives 'em the key to the gate.
   1012700|00000000||She's young and beautiful.
   1012701|00000000||But he's sure not.
   1012702|00000000||Let us worry about Thecla.
   1012703|00000000||Don't lie to her, she'll sniff it out at once. If she refuses to help, you must tell her you wish to undergo the trial.
   1012704|00000000||The trial?
   1012705|00000000||Uh, Thecla will explain.
   1012668|00000000||The Crones got any guests?
   1012669|00000000||We're looking for an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks the Crones might've invited him.
   1012670|00000000||The big knight? He near trampled me!
   1012671|00000000||On his way up the mountain?
   1012672|00000000||Yeah. What's it you want from him?
   1012673|00000000||He killed my friend.
   1012674|00000000||Out for vengeance, eh? Let it go. Dyin' foolishly won't help. Even the Crones bow and scrape before that one.
   1012633|00000000||Thanks for the advice. Let's go.
   1012706|00000000||Thanks for the advice. We should go.
   1012707|00000000||Good luck.
   1012708|00000000||Visit us sometime. We've a place not far from here.
   1012709|00000000||We'll be certain to stop by. So long.
   1074645|00000000||I must get down there.
    558062|00000000||He's lying, kill him.
    558099|00000000||He's lying, end it.
    558101|00000000||No, wait, I tell you true!
    558111|00000000||Prove it.
    558102|00000000||Remember… remember when we went to steal Dijkstra's treasure?
    558109|00000000||We released pops spores, made the troll drowsy. He sang in his sleep about Dijkstra's foot wrappings and asked for elf soup!
    564589|00000000||Shoulda picked someone else to impersonate.
    547150|00000000||Wouldn't have had to if you hadn't impersonated Whoreson.
    564593|00000000||What the blazes were you thinking?
    558257|00000000||Be careful. You could get found out.
    558267|00000000||Wily's men're too stupid to catch on. His colleagues ain't much better.
    558269|00000000||Mind you, even you were fooled.
    558270|00000000||And that might've ended very badly for you.
    558272|00000000||True, I… get a bit carried away at times. But mostly I'm careful.
    558208|00000000||Not afraid of being found out?
    558317|00000000||Time's up.
    558318|00000000||Right, we must still go by the Golden Sturgeon.
    558321|00000000||It was nice to see you both. And take care of yourselves.
    558323|00000000||You too.
    558324|00000000||So long, Dudu.
    558199|00000000||We need to go.
    558198|00000000||How's business?
    558211|00000000||Chose an interesting line of business.
    558216|00000000||Dudu's always had a head for numbers. What's a few brothels and casinos? He'll manage.
    558221|00000000||That's the thing - I don't need to.
    558223|00000000||Two weeks after Wily died I announced that I'd seen the light of the Eternal Fire.
    558226|00000000||Sold all the illegal enterprises. I'm a blue water trader now.
    558244|00000000||Whoreson's men didn't protest?
    558246|00000000||I've contacts in the guilds, run a thriving trade, profits are twice what they were before.
    558250|00000000||To Wily's men, a purse twice as heavy means twice as much respect for the man handin' it to them.
    558194|00000000||That was courageous, Dudu. I'd never expect it from you.
    558197|00000000||Neither would I.
    572091|00000000||Oh, by the way - you've no idea at the relief I feel you're alive and well.
    572105|00000000||And I'm relieved I didn't slit your throat.
    558129|00000000||Once we'd fled, I had no idea what to do. I could only hide for so long, they'd find me sooner or later.
    558130|00000000||It wasn't a hard decision. We knew he was dead, but not many others had caught on. That was me chance.
    564590|00000000||Not wise to play games with a witcher.
    564595|00000000||Whoreson Junior? Was there no one else you could impersonate?
    564588|00000000||That was a stupid joke.
    547149|00000000||Gods! You gave me quite the scare!
    558088|00000000||Wait, Ciri.
    558091|00000000||After the heist, after Dijkstra's vault was emptied, you vanished. How'd I find you? Quick.
    558092|00000000||Butchers' Yard - the mummers' play, Priscilla's. You dragged me onto the stage.
    558095|00000000||Sheathe your sword, Ciri. It's Dudu.
    558057|00000000||Prove it.
    547143|00000000||Well, well, who do we have here?
    558004|00000000||Finally found your little ward. Took your sweet fuckin' time.
    558045|00000000||Seems in fine health to me.
    547144|00000000||Ahhh, 'cause you thought you'd killed me that time. Surprise, sur-fuckin'-prise.
    558061|00000000||Shut your trap, witch, afore somebody fills that hole for you!
    558068|00000000||Enough.
    558069|00000000||I'll finish what you started.
    558074|00000000||Whoa-ho, stop! It's me, Dudu! Dudu Biberveldt! You really didn't recognize me?
    558087|00000000||Dudu?
    581110|00000000||Yeah, she's here.
    581119|00000000||Yeah. We're both here.
    581121|00000000||Where is the girl?
    581123|00000000||Doesn't matter. You'll never get her.
    581125|00000000||You fought bravely in the ruined keep, to the bitter end.
   1086392|00000000||I trust this time will be no different.
    581116|00000000||First you, then her.
    581112|00000000||I'm here alone.
    581114|00000000||A lie which will change nothing.
    581109|00000000||I came alone.
    540267|00000000||The sisters said you would come. They saw you arrive in the water's surface.
    540269|00000000||They did not see the girl, but she is with you, is she not?
    528671|00000000||I'll take her somewhere safe.
    554627|00000000||Then wait for you outside the Passiflora.
    554640|00000000||See you there.
    554645|00000000||Don't trouble yourself.
    554632|00000000||See you.
    554631|00000000||No, thanks. I'll manage.
    554628|00000000||Sure you don't need any help?
    554639|00000000||Want help?
    534048|00000000||Let's go.
    559818|00000000||Let's go.
    534047|00000000||Gimme a minute. Be right back.
    559824|00000000||Hurry.
    559819|00000000||I'll be back.
    527830|00000000||You're here. Bea's inside.
    558815|00000000||You say "Geralt"? Geralt who?
    558862|00000000||Of fucking Rivia.
    558817|00000000||We-e-ell, why didn't you say that from the get-go?
    558818|00000000||Sorry to hassle yous - misunderstandin', that.
    558896|00000000||Mr. Wily's expectin' you.
   1043409|00000000||Eeer... yeah, yeah, a deal.
   1043411|00000000||Go on upstairs. Boss is waitin'.
    558842|00000000||Make a deal, maybe…?
    558833|00000000||We'll figure something out.
    558845|00000000||Outta the way, you louts, or we'll cut up your mugs so the girls at Crippled Kate's won't even have you.
    558848|00000000||What'd you say?
    558850|00000000||Didn't understand? Too many syllables? Fuck off.
    558852|00000000||Oh, you little bitch!
    558853|00000000||Here I thought we could do this the nice way…
    558840|00000000||Get outta my way or regret it.
    558779|00000000||What?
    558780|00000000||Here to see Mr. Wily.
    558781|00000000||Mr. Wily's expectin' important guests, so bugger off, you, you…
    558836|00000000||Turds!
    560214|00000000||Sure it is.
    560217|00000000||You're a fuckin' freak, too.
    560224|00000000||He is. Very dangerous at that. The Butcher of White Orchard.
    564615|00000000||What'd he do there? Trim the trees?
    560228|00000000||Yugen, he slew half the village, dragged the bodies of the ealdorman and his wife behind his horse to Novigrad. Let's get out of here.
    560234|00000000||That's pretty good advice your friend's offering.
    560251|00000000||S-s-sorry.
    560209|00000000||Leave on your own…
    560211|00000000||Draw your weapons. Let's get this over with.
    560280|00000000||Whoa… what?
    560281|00000000||You're out to hurt her, I won't let you, so we'll argue and swagger and have who knows how long a pissing contest.
    560283|00000000||I don't have time for that. Draw your swords.
    560253|00000000||Or I'll throw you out.
    558938|00000000||Gave you a chance. Shoulda taken it.
    558940|00000000||I spit on anything you give me.
    560031|00000000||You'll regret that, you cow.
    534445|00000000||Mind your manners, you're talking to a lady.
    560206|00000000||Stay out of this - this is not your concern.
    171505|05d41baa||Fugas
   1061399|00000000||Good Ladies, Merciful Ladies.
   1062116|00000000||Me grandson, give 'im 'ealth.
   1062118|00000000||He works his share of mischief, but he's a good lad.
   1062120|00000000||Give 'im health. I beg yous.
   1060980|00000000||Hah. The one night we get to fill our bellies to the brim.
   1060982|00000000||Whoa, now. If the Ladies got vittles aplenty, why don't they feed us more often?
   1060984|00000000||Don't ye dare speak ill of our givers!
    572537|00000000||It's never been this bad.
    572685|00000000||They failed to find a way to leave Novigrad, so they made a last, hopeless stand…
    562529|00000000||Zoltan awaits your signal.
    562599|00000000||We'll manage on our own.
    536832|00000000||Need a bit more time.
    562641|00000000||Hurry.
    536835|00000000||Actually, maybe you're right. A little help can go a long way.
    562635|00000000||Of course I'm right.
    536836|00000000||Go. I'll wait here.
    536826|00000000||Wait, I'll get help.
    536825|00000000||Let's.
    536833|00000000||Let's do this.
    562530|00000000||Shall we begin?
    562526|00000000||Graden'll show up, and Zoltan awaits your signal.
    536821|00000000||Find a way in?
    536822|00000000||Several. Nearest is through a well not far from here.
    562532|00000000||Did you arrange any help?
    562609|00000000||Here we are.
   1059926|00000000||This is it? Hmm… Boulder was plugging the well until recently.
   1059928|00000000||Due to an edict Hemmelfart issued some years ago. But I managed to find two brawny and obliging passers-by who agreed to remove the impediment. For a modest fee, naturally.
   1059930|00000000||Here.
    562611|00000000||What is this?
    562613|00000000||Use it once you find Rita. I'll be able to pinpoint your location.
    562628|00000000||See you inside, then.
    562629|00000000||Good luck.
    562620|00000000||See you later.
    562619|00000000||Thought you'd come with me.
    562622|00000000||Not coming?
    562624|00000000||Mucking through ruins and sewers, hmmm, I'd rather leave it to the expert.
    562626|00000000||Meaning you'd rather waltz in once the hard work's done.
   1059893|00000000||Come. It's a short way away.
   1022078|00000000||And the Fourth - who were she?
   1022080|00000000||Some say she were their mother, others call her Sister Four.
   1022082|00000000||They took cold iron nails, pierced her heart, pierced her head, then sunk her lifeless corpse in a festering mire.
   1022109|00000000||The knight who rode to the summit - who were he?
   1022111|00000000||Who can know? Perhaps the Ladies charmed him to serve them at the feast?
   1022113|00000000||Perhaps he were one buried 'midst the oak's roots, one come to life when the tree bore acorns aplenty?
    546219|00000000||Look over there - children.
    546221|00000000||Both godlings. Ran into them before.
   1058903|00000000||No - a godling. I know him. Name's Johnny.
    543663|00000000||Look - a child.
    587690|00000000||To arms!
    587994|00000000||Mages revolting!
    587692|00000000||Raise the barricades!
    587992|00000000||Archers on the roof! All others to their stations!
    587694|00000000||Barred shut.
    588005|00000000||Need to find another way out.
    587696|00000000||Where are the mages?
    587698|00000000||Don't be fooled!
    588010|00000000||Sent him ahead. They'll mount a full assault in a minute!
   1061901|00000000||Thank ye, thank ye, good sir…
   1061903|00000000||Gods reward you!
   1061905|00000000||Thank you… Be careful, now. Don't let 'em get you.
    535986|00000000||Take off the kid gloves, Geralt.
    535988|00000000||Thought you'd agreed to meet.
    561391|00000000||I said I'd found him, not that I'd spoken to him.
    535989|00000000||What do you want from me?! Let me be!
    546214|00000000||Calm down. We just wanna chat.
   1061299|00000000||Uh-huh, and then stick a shiv between my ribs, leave me in the gutter.
   1061309|00000000||Look at us. Do we look like bandits to you?
   1061312|00000000||Hm… No… Not really.
   1061304|00000000||I'm glad you agree. Besides, you'd be worthless to us dead.
   1061314|00000000||So… you shan't hurt me?
    561395|00000000||No. You're gonna tell us your story, then be on your way.
   1061316|00000000||Hm… oh, so be it. But we, uh, really ought to go back to Kate's. It's unwise to linger in the street.
   1061319|00000000||Hm… No… Not really.
   1021996|00000000||What creatures enter the world 'neath a human veil - ye can never know.
   1021997|00000000||We, each one, use that veil as we will, how we will.
   1021998|00000000||The one sure thing's that its one true use has ne'er been revealed to none.
   1021999|00000000||From thence the many errors, from thence the casting off of the veil in the dark, that veil we call death.
   1022027|00000000||Harm not yourself nor your neighbor afore death.
   1022028|00000000||Prepare for it, for it too prepares for you.
   1022029|00000000||Drive it not off with bold words - reveal all to it instead.
    554976|00000000||The peasant folk of Velen call this night the Feast of Gifts. I've no idea why.
   1011422|00000000||Shit. Let's go, we must find the key.
   1010763|00000000||I'll wait for you here.
   1015414|00000000||Water coursing down there… Dammit, I'm jumping.
   1051173|00000000||I was beginning to worry. Come, let's get the key.
   1058806|00000000||Avallac'h claims vanity is Imlerith's greatest weakness.
   1059238|00000000||Hardly surprising given he was Avallac'h's student.
   1059236|00000000||The other one, Caranthir, is said to be secretive and pragmatic.
   1059234|00000000||Any foe he faces, he strives to impress.
    533396|00000000||Back off before this ends badly.
    533409|00000000||I like you, Dijkstra. Don't make me hurt you.
    533410|00000000||Save your threats for the rats that run about the port. They don't make the slightest impression on me.
    533397|00000000||This is no time for a lovers' quarrel.
    533411|00000000||I remember your little… bond, but this is no time for a lovers' quarrel.
    533412|00000000||But it's an excellent time to settle a score.
   1067433|00000000||Time'll tell.
   1067441|00000000||Time'll tell if I am or not.
   1067443|00000000||Except if you are talking bollocks, and I swallow it whole, well… it'll be too late.
   1067445|00000000||Guess you gotta take that risk.
    557146|00000000||But what's Philippa got to do with it?
    557148|00000000||Philippa will help us protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt.
   1067330|00000000||…
    557156|00000000||Go. Before I change my mind.
   1067500|00000000||Think you might wanna hear her out? Daresay Philippa despises Radovid at least as much as you do.
   1067502|00000000||I'm content someone apart from myself has finally gotten the idea to rid the world of the degenerate.
   1067504|00000000||Save your praise for others. I couldn't give a shit.
   1067506|00000000||Currently, only two individuals stand to draw Radovid off of his boat. Emhyr… and myself.
   1067508|00000000||You'd agree to be the bait?
   1067510|00000000||I fear you'd be hard pressed to convince Emhyr to dangle himself as such…
   1067512|00000000||Fat fucking chance! Geralt, I wouldn't trust this cunt to hard boil my eggs!
   1067514|00000000||Rightly so - I'm terrible with eggs. But think on this: Radovid hears that you've captured me… Will he not throw caution to the wind? Will he not jump at the chance to kill me… personally… with his bare hands?
   1067516|00000000||Out of the question! Geralt, get her out of here before I burst a testicle!
   1067582|00000000||And then… then we must meet. With our friends. I've leased a warehouse portside. Be sure to come.
   1067459|00000000||Let her talk.
   1067460|00000000||Except you won't.
   1067462|00000000||Dijkstra, Philippa's not gonna die - we're done discussing that. Forget about it.
   1067464|00000000||Situation's changed, witcher. She's in a position now to foil my plans.
   1067466|00000000||Do you really think I will run to warn the man who gouged my eyes out?
   1067447|00000000||You've no idea of the importance of this information. A change on the imperial throne? Could bring the war to an end.
   1067579|00000000||Radovid's sure to be delighted. If Emhyr sounds the retreat, there'll be no force left that could possibly stop that madman.
   1067578|00000000||Especially in light of our bloody aborted plan.
   1067449|00000000||You didn't actually believe you could do it? Radovid's crazy but he's no idiot. Knows all too well there're dozens out there who'd--
   1067451|00000000||Silence.
   1067454|00000000||Do I understand you correctly? You want to kill Radovid? Well, well, Sigi, I am impressed. Doubted you still had it in you, frankly.
   1067456|00000000||Sadly, as you well know, Radovid has sought refuge on his boat. He's guarded so closely I'd not be at all surprised to learn he shares his bed each night with two sentries.
   1067458|00000000||You know too much, Phil. Yet one more reason why you must die.
   1067435|00000000||Emperor himself told me, so… information's first hand.
   1067437|00000000||Emhyr's a lying whore.
   1067439|00000000||When it comes to his daughter's future? Doubt it.
   1067432|00000000||Heard it from Emhyr himself.
   1067431|00000000||Provided, of course, you're not mistaken…
    533405|00000000||Always knew the value of information, Dijkstra…
    557122|00000000||Which is why I don't believe you have anything I don't already know.
    557126|00000000||The emperor of Nilfgaard wasn't able to sway the Trade Corporation.
    557131|00000000||Opposition nibbling at his arse, eh? Hm, seems the White Flame won't dance on the graves of his foes much longer.
    557138|00000000||His daughter has returned. The emperor wants to abdicate, give her the throne.
    557144|00000000||Cirilla? Impossible! This… this could shift the tide of war…
    533393|00000000||Tell you what the emperor's after if you let us go.
    557100|00000000||Sorry. Can't let that happen.
   1091793|00000000||Oh! Aaa-aaa-aaargh!
    557104|00000000||No, no - not my leg!
    557107|00000000||Arrrrgggghhhh!
    533394|00000000||[Shove Dijkstra aside. Forcefully.]
    557097|00000000||Philippa will come with me. And answer for all the courtesies she's paid me.
    533407|00000000||Not gonna demonstrate a damn thing. I need her.
    533408|00000000||And I don't give a flying fuck.
    556564|00000000||I've awaited this moment forever, so, very sorry, but I care as much about your plans as I do about the snows of Mahakam.
    533395|00000000||I need her.
    533402|00000000||Deepest apologies, but the lady will come with me.
    556451|00000000||Dijkstra… I don't have time for this, get out of my way.
    556452|00000000||I've no quarrel with you, Geralt. But Phil and I have lots to talk about…
    556486|00000000||Remember the assassins you sent after me, darling Phil? A grave error. Such matters ought to be handled personally.
    556534|00000000||As I will now demonstrate.
    533401|00000000||Betray me and I will--
    556416|00000000||Relax. Not planning on it. Triss is outside, she'll explain everything.
    533399|00000000||Stop squirming. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be long dead by now.
    556367|00000000||What do you want? To torment me? To watch others do so?
    533400|00000000||I need your help.
