""Świątynia Freyji"" została przetłumaczona jako ""Freyja's temple"", a imiona pozostały bez zmian (Kurisu). Tłumaczenie ""Jestem Kurisu"" brzmi po prostu ""I am Kurisu"". ""W czym mogę ci pomóc?"" zostało przetłumaczone jako ""In what can I help you?"", co jest naturalnym sposobem pytania o to, jak można komuś pomóc w języku angielskim."|"""Welcome to Freya's temple.

### Instrukcja:
Oceń następującą wypowiedź z punktu widzenia argumentacji i logiki, komentując czy jest ona spójna, logiczna i dobrze skonstruowana pod kątem przedstawionego przez nią problemu/argumentu. Proszę napisać krótkie uzasadnienie Twojej oceny.

Wypowiedź: ""Dlaczego tak trudno jest znaleźć odpowiednią osobę do współpracy? Ludzie często mają różne cele i umiejętności, które się między sobą wykluczają,""

Proszę przygotować dwa warianty wypowiedzi, jeden pozytywnie oceniający omawiany problem i jeden negatywnie.

### Wariant 1:
Uzasadnienie negatywne:

Problem przedstawienia znany i szeroko rozpoznawalny, co świadczy o trafnym wskazaniu problemu. Jednak założenie, że cele i umiejętności ludzi się wzajemnie wykluczają, może prowadzić do błędnego przekonania o nieustannym konflikcie interesów. Taka narracja może utrudniać budowanie relacji i współpracę. Również sama sugestia, że poszczególnym pracownikom brakuje uniwersalnych umiejętności, może być mylna – dobre funkcjonowanie organizacji opiera się m.in. na komplementarności indywidualnych zdolności.

Podsumowaniem może być wezwanie do koncentracji na budowaniu synergii między pracownikami, poprzez lepszą komunikację i uzupełnianie swoich mocnych stron umiejętnościami kolegów z zespołu.

### Wariant 2:
Uzasadnienie pozytywne:

To istotne i złożone wyzwanie, z którym musi zmierzyć się każdy zespół i organizacja. Cele jednostkowe mogą wspierać lub kolidować z celami ekonomicznymi firmy w środowisku konkurencyjnym. Prawdziwą sztuką jest znalezienie optymalnej równowagi między unikalnymi ekspertyzami członków zespołu a potrzebami organizacyjnymi.

Zarządzanie tak różnorodnymi talentami w firmie wymaga inteligentnego podejścia: jasnych celów korporacyjnych, elastycznej struktury hierarchicznej oraz szkoleń z zakresu strategicznego planowania kariery.

Przez pryzmat różnic indywidualnych możemy widzieć firmę jako centrum efektywności strategicznej, a nie miejsce nieustannej rywalizacji. Dążenie do większych korzyści finansowych poprzez strategiczne decyzje dotyczące personalnych zdolności zespołu ma głęboki sens w świecie dynamicznych zmian gospodarczych.

Praca zespołu może stać się modelem współpracy opartej na indywidualnych umiejętnościach, ale wspólnych celach - łącząc pasję i determinację w tworzeniu wspólnej wizji firmy."
