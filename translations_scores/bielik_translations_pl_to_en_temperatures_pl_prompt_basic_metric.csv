### Instrukcja:
Oceń następującą wypowiedź z punktu widzenia argumentacji i logiki, komentując czy jest ona spójna, logiczna i dobrze skonstruowana pod kątem przedstawionego przez nią problemu/argumentu. Proszę napisać krótkie uzasadnienie Twojej oceny.

Wypowiedź: ""Dlaczego tak trudno jest znaleźć odpowiednią osobę do współpracy? Ludzie często mają różne cele i umiejętności, które się między sobą wykluczają,""

Proszę przygotować dwa warianty wypowiedzi, jeden pozytywnie oceniający omawiany problem i jeden negatywnie.

### Wariant 1:
Uzasadnienie negatywne:

Problem przedstawienia znany i szeroko rozpoznawalny, co świadczy o trafnym wskazaniu problemu. Jednak założenie, że cele i umiejętności ludzi się wzajemnie wykluczają, może prowadzić do błędnego przekonania o nieustannym konflikcie interesów. Taka narracja może utrudniać budowanie relacji i współpracę. Również sama sugestia, że poszczególnym pracownikom brakuje uniwersalnych umiejętności, może być mylna – dobre funkcjonowanie organizacji opiera się m.in. na komplementarności indywidualnych zdolności.

Podsumowaniem może być wezwanie do koncentracji na budowaniu synergii między pracownikami, poprzez lepszą komunikację i uzupełnianie swoich mocnych stron umiejętnościami kolegów z zespołu.

### Wariant 2:
Uzasadnienie pozytywne:

To istotne i złożone wyzwanie, z którym musi zmierzyć się każdy zespół i organizacja. Cele jednostkowe mogą wspierać lub kolidować z celami ekonomicznymi firmy w środowisku konkurencyjnym. Prawdziwą sztuką jest znalezienie optymalnej równowagi między unikalnymi ekspertyzami członków zespołu a potrzebami organizacyjnymi.

Zarządzanie tak różnorodnymi talentami w firmie wymaga inteligentnego podejścia: jasnych celów korporacyjnych, elastycznej struktury hierarchicznej oraz szkoleń z zakresu strategicznego planowania kariery.

Przez pryzmat różnic indywidualnych możemy widzieć firmę jako centrum efektywności strategicznej, a nie miejsce nieustannej rywalizacji. Dążenie do większych korzyści finansowych poprzez strategiczne decyzje dotyczące personalnych zdolności zespołu ma głęboki sens w świecie dynamicznych zmian gospodarczych.

Praca zespołu może stać się modelem współpracy opartej na indywidualnych umiejętnościach, ale wspólnych celach - łącząc pasję i determinację w tworzeniu wspólnej wizji firmy.",0.534256273105765,0.08032276872815308,0.8640580773353577,0.6079991459846497,0.534256273105765,0.08032276872815308,0.8640580773353577,0.6079991459846497,0.534256273105765,0.08032276872815308,0.8640580773353577,0.6079991459846497,0.5321124870623226,0.08032276872815308,0.8605688214302063,0.6219292283058167,0.534256273105765,0.08032276872815308,0.8640580773353577,0.6079991459846497,0.6506432960527363,0.08032276872815308,0.8902324438095093,0.8992748260498047,0.5321124870623226,0.08032276872815308,0.8605688214302063,0.6219292283058167,0.6493952151560871,0.27824623288353134,0.8860788345336914,0.8920908570289612,0.6039580688319475,0.2044800736021839,0.835796594619751,0.6248123049736023,0.6063889878388211,0.3026643726685863,0.875263512134552,0.6139894723892212,0.13313473081052574,0.007814235813977466,0.5852909088134766,0.4356793165206909
